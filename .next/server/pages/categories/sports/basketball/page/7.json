Following their second consecutive conference loss — a defeat at the hands of struggling rival Cal Poly — the Gauchos found themselves at the bottom of the Big West standings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in sports, one win can change everything. Following Santa Barbara’s home victory over Long Beach State, the Gauchos find themselves only one and a half games behind first place in the conference. With home games this week against Cal State Fullerton and Hawaii, anything is possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s always great to get a win in your rivalry game, and it was very important in confidence and momentum for us,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “I thought we did a good job of cleaning up things that we have struggled with this season, and it showed on the floor.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the Gauchos’ (4-12, 1-2) struggles on the season, the ‘Chos have consistently dominated the fourth quarter. In the first two conference games — both losses — UCSB outscored its opponents by a combined score of 48-35 in the fourth quarter. On Saturday, that proved to be the difference against a feisty Long Beach State squad, with the Gauchos outscoring LBSU 17-11 in the fourth quarter en route to their six point victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps most importantly for the Gauchos, junior center Natalia Bruening was finally able to get going in conference play, dropping 16 points on an efficient 7-8 from the floor. Bruening’s ability to box out also helped UCSB dominate the glass, with Santa Barbara out-rebounding Long Beach by a massive 17 rebound margin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We defended better, something we have talked about as a team [all year],” Henrickson said. “If we aren’t scoring, we have to be better defenders. We forced Long Beach into some tough two’s, and it was one of our better rebounding games on both ends of the floor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impressively, UCSB pulled off the victory despite making only one three-pointer the entire game — a shocking stat considering the emphasis on three-pointers in the modern game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, UCSB will face a massive test when Cal State Fullerton (11-6,2-1) comes to town on Thursday. The Titans feature one of the most consistent offenses in the entire conference, with the team averaging nearly 68 points per game on the season. Much of the team’s success on that end can be attributed to its elite ball movement: CSUF averages nearly 16 assists per game and has four players averaging double figures on the season. This movement allows the Titans to get open looks, with the team as a whole shooting almost 44 percent from the floor on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton is led by sophomore guard Raina Perez — a floor general who leads the team both in scoring (13.9 ppg) and assists (5.4 apg). Perez has been a workhorse all season, averaging nearly 36 minutes per game while still remaining efficient.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the biggest surprise for CSUF this season has been freshman guard Amiee Book’s scoring off the bench. Arguably the best sharpshooter in the entire conference, Book is shooting 50 percent from beyond the arc despite taking four three’s a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fullerton has a very good post and they surround her with good playmaking guards who can shoot the three,” Henrickson said. “They do a good job of manufacturing offense, and they can score on every level. We need another strong team defensive effort on Thursday night.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its gaudy offensive numbers, Fullerton averages almost 17 turnovers per game — a fact that has at times proved to be its achilles heel. The Titans also give up almost 66 points per game, meaning the Gauchos should have plenty of room to operate their offense on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the ’Chos are to keep pace with Fullerton, they will need junior guard Coco Miller to be on her game. Santa Barbara’s leading scorer this season with 14.6 ppg, Miller dropped a career-high 33 points against Cal Poly earlier this month. In the win against LBSU, however, Miller struggled to find her shooting touch, going 0-5 from downtown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sledding should be slightly easier for UCSB on Saturday, when a struggling Hawaii team comes to town. Antithetical to CSUF’s offense, the Rainbow Wahine feature a rather anemic offense that has struggled mightily in conference play. In their last conference game against Cal State Northridge, Hawaii scored only 29 points in the entire game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, Santa Barbara can’t afford to overlook a squad that has already knocked off first-place UC Davis during conference play. What Hawaii lacks in offensive firepower, it makes up for with a defense that holds opponents to 40 percent shooting from the field. Even in its blowout loss against CSUN, Hawaii only gave up 49 points the entire game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Wahine are led by junior Makenna Woodfolk, a jack-of-all-trades forward who averages 11.8 points per game while also grabbing 5.9 rebounds per game — both of which lead the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to Long Beach State, Hawaii has struggled on the glass all season — an area that should pay dividends for the Gauchos on Saturday. Look for UCSB to try to feed Bruening inside and play out of her to break apart the stout Hawaii defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With momentum on its side and two home games this week, UCSB has a golden opportunity to jump back into the conference title race. The Gauchos will host the Titans on Thursday at 7 p.m., while their game against Hawaii will tip off on Saturday at 4 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

One of Long Beach State’s strength is their ability to make three pointers, which was on full display to start the game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 49ers would go into the second quarter with a one point lead but UCSB would turn the tables as they outscored LBSU by three points, giving them a two-point lead going into halftime. Redshirt junior Coco Miller started to find her rhythm as she swished a couple mid-range jumpers which gave the Gauchos some momentum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller came into this game red hot as she had a career high scoring performance with 33 points, with 18 of those points coming from behind the three-point line. Although it was a slow start, she would make a huge impact in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither team could create separation from the other in the third period with both teams seemingly scoring at will. Junior center Natalie Bruening dominated in the post as she used her size to convert easy layups. For LBSU, junior forward Cydnee Kinslow had an outstanding third quarter with two threes as well as a couple of steals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruening has started to find her confidence as of late on the offensive end of the floor as she is attacking the basket aggressively, leading to an increase in free throw attempts. Going forward, it will be crucial that she sustains this level of play because it will force defenses to double her in the paint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were finally able to gain some breathing room as they outscored the 49ers by six points in the final eight minutes to come away with the victory. Danae Miller not only hit a clutch mid-range floater with the shot clock about to expire but iced the game from the free throw line as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the keys behind their victory was their ability to hold the 49ers to 35 percent shooting from the field, which can be attributed to the persistent ball pressure. All five players on the court were communicating on the floor as well which kept LBSU from finding their rhythm offensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another welcoming sight for UCSB was the balanced scoring between Danae Miller, Coco Miller and Bruening who combined for 46 of the team’s total 60 points. This is extremely encouraging for a team that has struggled to find a second scorer to emerge behind Coco Miller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although sophomore guard Bri Anugwom did not make an impact scoring the ball, her contributions on the other end of the floor cannot be overlooked as she grabbed a career high fourteen rebounds in the contest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to build upon this game, they will need to continue to bring maximum defensive effort as they still build chemistry on the offensive end. Moreover, they will need to continue to play team basketball and avoid the ball sticking in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be back in action next week as it faces Cal State Fullerton at home on Thursday Jan. 24 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

They held the Ags to just 27% on threes despite UC Davis shooting more efficiently from the field than SB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Reigning Big West Conference MVP TJ Shorts II posted 11 points for the Aggies on 5-11 shooting while dragging down a team-high five boards in the process, but when a 5-foot-9 point guard is the team’s leading rebounding, it’s certainly apparent why Davis has been struggling this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded UC Davis 37-21– a monstrous 16-rebound differential made possible by 12 offensive boards from UCSB which led to 12 second chance points on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Although the Aggies attack came out firing with a 10-0 run to open up the game, the Gauchos fired back with a triple from junior guard Max Heidegger to get SB on the board.</p>\n<p>“The first four-minute war, we were down 10-0. I felt like I was back at Washington,” joked Pasternack. “I better change my pregame speech and my half time speech.”</p>\n<p>Heidegger quarterbacked a 14-4 stretch for UCSB after freshman guard Sekou Toure muscled into the paint for consecutive offensive rebounds and dipped it back to a wide-open Jay Nagle, and the three-point specialist struck again to tie it up at 14 with a trey on the right wing.</p>\n<p>Nagle had eight points in the first half while shooting 3-4 from the field and 2-3 behind the perimeter as he added the final five points of the half for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UC Davis pulled back ahead with a pair of free-throws, but Ar’mond Davis answered right back with his first three of the game which came unassisted as shook his defender in isolation at the top of the arc and fired from deep to put SB on top 17-16.</p>\n<p>To close out the half, Santa Barbara posted 26 points with big threes from four separate Gauchos to lead 43-31 at the break. After one, there were six Gauchos that had notched five or more points with Armond Davis leading the way scoring 10 points in 14 minutes.</p>\n<p>Out of the break, the Ags weren’t done yet. Davis went on a 14-5 run to open the half on a strong note once again led by junior guard Joe Mooney who carried out a 3-point play when he cut through defenders, drew contact, and finished at the rack to cut the deficit to just three at 48-45.</p>\n<p>That was the closest the Aggies would be to a comeback as Ar’mond Davis took over with 13 points in the second half with a triad of triples to balloon the lead to 64-54 with 3:53 to play.</p>\n<p>“I really challenged Ar’mond Davis about offensive rebounding last night and I think he was a monster,” said Head Coach Joe Pasternack. “Four offensive rebounds and he was a complete player…to get a victory like this on the road, this is amazing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is off for a week off following its sixth straight victory, but has a big week ahead as it remains on a 3-game road trip with games at Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach next Thursday and Saturday respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The Gauchos are red hot entering this game, considering their current five-game win streak that they’d like to extend over the Aggies.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s most recent win occurred last weekend in another Big West showdown at home against UC Riverside, which ended in a 72-64 final score that favored the Gaucho hosts.</p>\n<p>On the season, UCSB stands at an overall record of 13-3, with an outstanding 9-0 record when at home.</p>\n<p>Although on paper this upcoming match may appear to be a trap game, UCSB is actually 2-3 when it comes to their performance on the road.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, UC Davis is 3-2 when defending their home court, so both teams will want to bring those respective records to an even .500 win percentage.</p>\n<p>A win for the Gauchos will bring their win streak to six in a row and further cement their status at the top of the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>As for UC Davis, the Aggies will want to get their act together quickly, even in this unlikeliest of matchups.</p>\n<p>On the season, UC Davis holds an overall record of 4-12, including constantly poor showings on the road with a 0-9 away record.</p>\n<p>The month of January has been a bit fairer for the Aggies, who have won one of three matches over this period.</p>\n<p>Although both of those losses were well fought and one of them was an overtime heartbreaker, these pair of road games were both Big West confrontations and are the reason for UC Davis’ presence at the bottom of conference standings.</p>\n<p>Historically, this will be the 39th time these two sides have faced off against each other.</p>\n<p>From the 38 other previous meetings, UCSB leads favorably with a 29-9 all-time series record. The last meeting between these two occurred last year, where the Aggies upset the at-home Gauchos by a final score of 71-54.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, conference matchups are always prone to go either way, regardless of a perceived advantage.</p>\n<p>After an incredible showing last week against UC Riverside, UCSB’s freshman forward Amadou Sow is this week’s one to watch.</p>\n<p>At 6’9”, Sow enters the UC Davis game following a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds; each stat was game-leading in the aforementioned match.</p>\n<p>A vital part in head coach Pasternak’s team layout, Sow has been tearing up stat lines all season long, leading his side in total rebounds, with 100 to his name, and fourth in both total scoring and minutes played.</p>\n<p>Another player to watch would be the Gauchos’ senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon.</p>\n<p>Slowly starting to see more consistent minutes, Blackmon has made the most of his play time as he leads his team in total blocks with 17, and he is third overall in total rebounds with 67.</p>\n<p>Both Sow and Blackmon will feature as UCSB’s premier rim protectors against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>On the opposing end, Aggies’ senior guard TJ Shorts II is in charge of making the offense function.</p>\n<p>As UC Davis’ leader in total points and assists, Shorts II already has 239 points and 60 assists to his name.</p>\n<p>He’ll also be hungry for a win after coming just short against last week’s opponent in Long Beach State, a match where he added 19 points, five assists and three steals to his tally.</p>\n<p>Coming off a team-leading 29 points against Long Beach State, junior guard Joe Mooney will be in fine form entering the UCSB game.</p>\n<p>Mooney appears to be the Aggies’ three-point specialist as he leads his side in three-pointers, with a total of 29 on the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will want to keep both Mooney and Shorts II in mind come game time.</p>\n<p>Although Davis is currently in last place, their play so far this year has been an outlier, not the norm. With the return of AJ John to the lineup for the Aggies, the Gauchos can’t afford to take the win for granted.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be the visiting side this Thursday, Jan. 17, as they travel to UC Davis for a tip-off time 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

UCSB women’s basketball team fell to the Cal Poly Mustangs on Saturday, 75-67. With the loss, the Gauchos now drop to 3-12 on the season, and sit in last place in the Big West with an 0-2 record during conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, Saturday’s game magnified the issues the Gauchos have had all season: slow starts, inefficient offense and lack of depth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In front of a home crowd of 1,100 people, the Mustangs came out firing in the first quarter, desperate to pick up their first conference win of the season. In that quarter, Cal Poly outscored Santa Barbara 18-10, shooting 50 percent from the floor while holding the Gauchos to only 33 percent shooting. Perhaps most importantly, the Mustangs outrebounded UCSB by a margin of 9-4, with junior center Natalia Bruening having to sit for Santa Barbara after picking up two early fouls. Once again, the Gauchos found themselves having to play from behind the entire game, only holding the lead for 21 seconds in the entire game.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Miller’s career night, Santa Barbara’s offensive deficiencies once again hamstrung their ability to keep pace with the Mustangs.

For a normally anemic offense, the Mustangs played one of their best offensive games of the season, shooting 50 percent from the floor. With seven players scoring more than 7 points each, the Gaucho defense struggled to contain the balanced Mustang approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the night, Cal Poly was paced by senior guard Dye Stahley, who scored 16 points on 4-9 shooting. Freshman guard Maddie Willett also played one of her best games on the season, scoring 15 points while shooting 60 percent from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Gauchos should be commended for their effort despite what has been a trying season. Just as they did against CSUN two weeks ago, UCSB outscored Cal Poly in the fourth quarter in a valiant comeback attempt. Unfortunately, as has been the case for much of the season, they fell just a little bit short.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to get back on track in conference play, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to Long Beach State.

With only a 4-10 record on the season, however, LBSU should be a beatable opponent for a Santa Barbara team that desperately needs a morale-boosting victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After opening conference play with two road games, the Gauchos will return home for their game on Saturday against Long Beach State, with tip-off slated for 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

We love playing here, we love the fans and we have to continue to make sure we stay undefeated at home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four Gauchos hit double-figures as freshman facilitator Amadou Sow was the pulse of the SB attack with a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds from 10-18 shooting, and he came out firing with six of the first eight Gaucho points in the game.  Sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and Davis each scored 12 points in the contest, and in the back court McLaughlin also added five assists with zero turnovers and two takeaways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a swipe from McLaughlin at 14:26, the sophomore pushed his tempo, split defenders and cut to the rack before a swift kick-out pass to Davis who knocked down a triple from the far corner to put UCSB up 11-6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB pulled ahead early, Riverside battled back behind a sharp three-ball attack spearheaded by junior guard Dikymbe Martin. Down 23-18 with seven minutes to play in the half, Martin corralled his own miss and pulled up with a teardrop in the restricted area to cut it to a one-possession game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After forcing a miss from UCSB on the other end, Highlanders’ redshirt sophomore guard Dominick Pickett nabbed another offensive rebound on the attacking half of the floor with a split-second look back out to Martin who drilled a right-wing jumper from behind the arc to knot it up at 23 apiece.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebounding was huge for the Highlanders who led at the half 34-32 following 18 boards before the break and a +4 rebound-margin against the top team on the boards in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the first half belonged to UCR, the Gauchos came to play in the second with a 7-0 run to open up behind five points from Ramsey in the first two minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, Riverside continued to fight. The three ball was working for the Highlanders who had five treys in the second, including a smooth stroke from sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy who tied the game up at 46-46 with 13:37 to play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams traded threes over the next five-minute frame before Ramsey put his foot down and ultimately took over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Riverside up 56-53, Gaucho senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon cut to the hoop and floated under the basket before firing a pass to Ramsey in the corner who nailed one from deep to tie it up at 56.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the ensuing possession, Ramsey received an outlet pass from Sow and barreled coast-to-coast with a spin in the lane to draw the contact and count the bucket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it’s time to finish the game or when my team needs a spark, I have to pick my energy up,” expressed Ramsey after his 20-point performance. “Whether that’s defensively or offensively, I try to do whatever it takes for the team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that point on, the Gauchos didn’t look back as McLaughlin delivered an alley-oop from 35-feet out to Sow at the basket who threw it down and put the nail in the coffin to hand the Highlanders their 12th loss of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB sits in a tie for first place in the Big West with UC Irvine and Cal State Northridge after a pair of conference games, while Riverside dropped to sixth following a couple of heartbreaking losses to open Big West play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos take to the road for a three-game stretch with their first Big West Conference away matchup at UC Davis next Thursday with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m. at The Pavilion. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

That game in particular displayed the growth of the young Gauchos side, with the team keeping the game close throughout despite junior Coco Miller–the team’s leading scorer–shooting only 2-17 from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s offense–the biggest culprit for the team’s slow start–has seen an uptick since sophomore guard Danae Miller came back from injury. Danae’s four assists per game leads the team, and her speed has allowed the Gauchos to play more in transition, leading to easier baskets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last game against CSUN, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson opted to tighten up the rotation, playing both Danae Miller and Coco Miller for almost the entire game. While the Gauchos scored 73 points in that game, the bench contributed only 11 of those points–with all 11 coming from junior forward Tal Sahar. As conference play continues and fatigue becomes more of a factor, Henrickson will need greater production from her bench if the Gauchos hope to stay competitive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one game into conference play, it’s risky to call any game a must-win matchup. Still, for two teams that have struggled mightily throughout the season, a win on Saturday will aid greatly in getting their season back on track. Given both teams’ offensive struggles and defensive prowess, expect a low-scoring affair on Saturday where 60 points may be all that’s needed to secure the win.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly (0-1, 3-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Poly women’s basketball team enters Saturday’s match just as desperate for a victory as any other Big West team after getting thumped at home by UC Irvine in their conference opener, 75-59.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the season, Cal Poly comes in with a 3-9 record, with only two of those victories over division I opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to the Gauchos, the Achilles heel for Cal Poly all season has been their offense, with the team scoring only about 60 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, however, the Mustang’s offense has been slightly more potent since the return of graduate transfer Hana Vesela from injury.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her three games this season, Vesela has averaged almost 11 points per game. As she gets more acclimated to the team’s offense, her offensive output should continue to increase even more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s game will be a battle of two nearly identical teams when it comes to play style. Both teams look to play inside out, featuring their big on the inside to swallow up rebounds and finish off easy layups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Mustangs, sophomore center Devin Stanback leads the team with 13.6 points per game while shooting an impressive 51 percent from the floor. For Santa Barbara, junior center Natalia Bruening has essentially played the same role, scoring 10 points per game while shooting 50 percent from the floor. Imperative to both team’s success on Saturday will be their stud center staying out of foul trouble–an issue that in particular has plagued Bruening throughout the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly also excels on the boards; despite their overall struggles, they have consistently out-rebounded their opponents throughout the season. For a Gauchos team that prefers to play with four guards, it will be imperative for them to box-out and limit any easy second chance opportunities for the Mustangs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State (0-0, 3-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being picked to finish fourth in the Big West preseason poll, Long Beach State struggled significantly in non-conference play. With both an anemic offense and an undersized core that has been dominated on the glass, LBS limps into conference play with a 3-10 record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Led by sophomore guard Shanaijah Davison’s 14.8 points per game, Long Beach State averages fewer than 60 points per game. Even Davison — a preseason All-Big West pick — has struggled with her efficacy, shooting only 37 percent from the floor despite taking almost 15 shots per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Long Beach has been able to keep it close — with five of the team’s losses scoring in the single digits — the team has been sunk by its 59 free throw percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Long Beach has played with a relatively solid defense — they currently hold opponents to 43 percent from the floor — their Achilles heel all season has been their lack of rebounds. On average, Long Beach State has been outrebounded by 16 rebounds per game, allowing their opponents to have second-chance opportunities despite their solid initial defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, they will enter conference play with a bit of momentum on their side after winning their last two non-conference matchups, including a 50-48 victory over Utah State in their last game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that game, graduate transfer forward Cydnee Kinslow made her season debut after sitting out the first 12 games injured, and immediately made her presence known by grabbing nine rebounds in 37 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The addition of Kinslow should help Long Beach play more competitively.    Though Long Beach State has struggled most of the season, don’t be surprised if Davison cleans up her offensive efficiency and leads the team to a .500 record in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UCI (1-0, 13-1)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Irvine women’s basketball team was selected to finish in third place by the Big West preseason poll with only sophomore forward Jordan Sanders earning a spot on the preseason All-Conference Team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, 13 games and one league match into the season, there is no doubt that the Anteaters are the team to beat thus far into conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UCI is at the top of the Big West conference with a 1-0 league record and, more importantly, an 11-2 overall mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the Anteaters two losses came against a very tough Oregon team ranked No. 5 in the country but the other came against a much weaker San Diego State team that is just 5-8 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDSU did beat two other Big West programs in Hawai’i and Cal State Fullerton but lost to UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UC Irvine is the only team in the league thus far to have double digit wins and that is in large part to the performance of Sanders who is averaging an astonishing 21.1 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is not just the best mark on her team but the second best average in the Big West sitting just behind UC Davis’ Morgan Bertsch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders also leads her team in rebounds per game with 5.5 boards per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also receives help from fellow teammates Lauren Saiki and Andee Ritter who both average double figures in points per contest.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With three stud players on offense, UC Irvine hopes it can continue its great start to the year and possibly earn a Big West title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine takes on CSUN on Saturday at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUN (1-0, 7-8)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team is currently 7-8 on the year and will look to get back to .500 as they played their second game of the conference schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been an up and down year for the Matadors but they were able to pick up a win in their most recent matchup against UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are led by senior center Channon Fluker who is averaging a double double on the year with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She also leads the team with the highest field goal percentage from the field with 48.3 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the problems that the squad has faced this year is that they lack a consistent second scorer behind Fluker. With no one on the team averaging double figures besides Fluker, it has been difficult at times for them to put up points consistently. With them in the midst of conference play, it will be crucial for a second scorer to emerge in order to keep opposing defenses from keying on Fluker in the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, CSUN has been very impressive on the defensive end of the floor as they have held opponents to just 38 percent from the field. Much of that can be attributed to the consistent ball pressure which has led to opposing offenses struggling to find the bottom of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Matadors to turn their season around, they will need to find more ways to score the basketball, which also means that they must improve their three point percentage. With more consistent from behind the three point line, it will help keep defenses honest which will lead to easier shots for every player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN is back in action at UC Irvine where they will look to pick up their second win in conference play at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hawai’i (0-1, 4-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Big West play in full effect, the Hawai’i women’s basketball team is set to bounce back following a tough league opener loss to Cal State Fullerton.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Hawai’i has struggled all year long boasting just a 4-10 overall mark to this point in the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Rainbow Wahine are just 1-4 away from their home court.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, they will return home for a quick two-game stretch with matches against UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just recently, Hawai’i had won three straight games with two coming against well known division I programs but it is now losers of three straight. It’s last two losses have been by a combined five points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were hoping to turn around this season and, despite a loss at the Cal State Fullerton, they still played a great game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Jan. 5, the Rainbow Wahine scored 68 points which was their third highest point total this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i’s big scorer in that game was redshirt sophomore forward Amy Atwell who came up huge. She scored a career high 25 points in just 16 minutes with 18 of those points coming in the second half alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the season, Atwell averages just four points a game, even after that terrific coming out party. With an increased role maybe she can be a factor this team needs to turn it around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Rainbow Wahine will hope to continue relying on junior forward Makenna Woodfolk who leads the team in points per game with the only player in double figures at 11.8.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, in the last three games she has averaged just three points per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i will host UC Davis on Saturday at 1 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUF (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal State Fullerton women come into Big West play in 2019 one year removed from finishing last in the conference, missing out on the Big West Tournament and losing 12 out of their final 13 games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, however, their season is moving in a totally different trajectory, as they are currently sporting a 9-5 record and have won seven of their last eight contests —  including a win over Hawaii in their conference opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans have a roster that contains a mixture of upperclassmen and underclassmen that provide valuable contributions to the squad. Four players are scoring in double figures on the season and that group is lead by redshirt senior Daeja Smith, whose averages of 13.8 points per game and 9.7 rebounds per game rank fifth and second in the Big West, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Smith, one of the keys to Fullerton’s early season success has been the playmaking ability of their backcourt duo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raina Perez and Jade Vega both average double-digit scoring numbers to go along with their averages of five-plus assists per game, each.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez and Vega rank second and third in the Big West in assists per game, giving Fullerton added versatility  as the two players are capable of handling the ball and playmaking for others on the floor. The ability that Perez and Vega have to score and assist the ball complements the inside scoring game of Daeja Smith and makes their team as a whole extremely difficult to guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans finished in last place a season ago and were yet again picked to finish last according to the Big West preseason poll, but with the improved play of their returning players and the addition of some elite newcomers, Fullerton will look to turn the tables on the conference and show everyone that they can be a legitimate force in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside (0-1, 6-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conference play for women’s basketball is now in full effect, as the second fixture for UC Riverside’s Big West campaign is set for this Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off a close 59-67 defeat to UC Davis, for their first Big West confrontation, the UC Riverside Highlanders will look to improve as the young conference schedule begins to ramp up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far through the season, the Highlanders find themselves at a 6-9 overall record; enough for a .400 win percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signs point upwards, however, as the team evenly split their game schedule in the month of December, snagging a couple of road wins along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although, they’ll want to find their rhythm as soon as possible considering they dropped their first conference matchup of the new year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside’s redshirt junior guard, Jannon Otto, leads all scorers on the team with 195 points to her name so far through the season; that’s a 13 point per game average. Playmaking seems to also run through her as she also leads her side in total assists with 47.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close behind Otto, in scoring, is junior forward Marina Ewodo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Featuring as the squad’s premier rim protector, Ewodo leads all her teammates in blocks, with 33, as well as rebounds, with a total of 107.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, these two tend to be at the top of opponents’ game plan as they play such a crucial part on the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of conference performance, UC Riverside finished as a middle of the table team in Big West standings last year; ending their campaign with a 6-10 overall record in conference play, good enough for the sixth seed in the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, they did perform very well during the postseason, making it as far as the semifinal stage; ultimately giving the No. 1 overall seed, UC Davis, a nail biter of a game after falling just short by a final score of 46-49.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as this young year goes, their 0-1 start places them in sixth place once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectations are high however, as a better league finish can set up yet another surprising playoff run for the Highlanders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up on UC Riverside’s schedule is another Big West bout, this time against Long Beach State, who is 3-10 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Long Beach State’s first Big West matchup, but the Highlanders should have a slight upper hand entering this one.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside hosts Long Beach State this Thursday, January 10th, in the SRC Arena at 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re the two-time defending regular season Big West champs. They’ve lost just four regular season Big West games in the last two years. They’ve got the fifth-leading scorer in the nation. They’ve won six games in a row.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis women’s basketball team is the team to beat in the Big West. That’s been the case for a couple of years, and a slow Aggie start isn’t enough to change that this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCD, now 9-5 and 1-0 in the Big West after beating UC Riverside, started this season 0-3. That mark included a blowout loss to then-no. 7 ranked Stanford and tough losses to Pacific and Portland State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That start seems to be in the past now for head coach Jennifer Gross’s squad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eighth-year coach has guided her team and steadied the ship, even despite some key graduations from last year’s group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the court, the turnaround has largely relied on the back of Morgan Bertsch, a 6’ 4” senior forward who’s fifth in the NCAA, is the leading scorer in UC Davis program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertsch goes, so does the Aggie’s offense. That hasn’t been a problem considering the senior’s production, but it gives opponents an obvious point to focus on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Point guard Kourtney Eaton has been the woman in charge of feeding Bertsch, a job the four-year starter and the program’s all-time assist leader has performed capably with 5.1 assists per game. Junior forward Nina Bessolo works as Bertsch’s scoring complement with 9.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game while sophomore Cierra Hall leads the team with 6.9 rebounds per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to the rest of the Big West, the Aggies love the three-ball. UCD has put up 333 threes so far this season, more than any other rival school. Only UCSB comes close with 331, and the Gauchos’ 26.1 percent mark from deep pales in comparison to UCD’s 32.4 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that shooting and all those points – the Aggies are second in the Big West in points per game at 71.4 – hasn’t come at the expense of their defense. UCD has given up just 62.5 points per game, again second in the conference, and are holding opponents to a Big West-worst 36.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis is rolling on both ends of the court right now as they begin to defend their crown again. It’s hard to bet against them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big West Prediction: UC Davis (Hard to bet against the champs when they’ve got the best scorer and maybe the best defense).</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The fans were jumping out of their seats and the energy in this Blue-Green rivalry seemed to even surpass the rivalry on the soccer field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out the gates with a burst of energy of their own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They started off the game hot from the three, as Jaquori Mclaughlin knocked down his first two triples, and combined with an early Ar’mond Davis deep shot, UCSB jumped out to an early 11-5 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, after a very early timeout, the Mustangs showed that they weren’t going to go down easy. Donovan Fields put up two quick buckets to cut the lead to three and effectively stopped the Gauchos early run. The junior guard has commanded the offense all season for the Mustangs, averaging a team-leading 16.1 points to go along with 4.6 assists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most defenders that the Gauchos threw at him had a significant height advantage, Fields was still able to get to the basket at will, and he ended the game with a team-high of 19 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main theme of the first half for UCSB was fluidity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Pasternack made five subs in the first five minutes, which allowed the Gauchos to play an intense switch-heavy defense to start off the game. Combined with great off the ball movement on the offensive end, UCSB’s hockey-style substitutions meant that the rock was not in any one player’s hand for long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although they started off hot from the three-point range, the Gauchos also didn’t settle for long jumpers as the ball zipped around on offense, leading to easy buckets for the frontcourt. A layup by freshman Amadou Sow, followed by a thunderous Robinson Idehen dunk in the next possession, lit up the Thunderdome and gave UCSB a 24-14 lead with just under seven minutes to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly did not back down, however, and a quick 11-2 run by the Mustangs cut the lead down to just one point with two minutes to go in the half. Cal Poly was not very efficient from three, but back to back deep jumpers by Donovan Fields and Kuba Niziol forced the Gauchos to call a time-out, and it seemed as if the two teams would be deadlocked going into the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaquori Mclaughlin had other plans, however. After a couple of quick buckets by freshman Sekou Toure, the Oregon State transfer knocked down his fourth three of the half to put UCSB up 35-27 going into halftime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two teams started the second half off by trading buckets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the frenetic pace at the start of the game favored UCSB, the Mustangs were able to slow the game down in the second period. Freshman Daxton Carr knocked down a couple buckets to bring the score to 43-41 with 14 minutes to go, and for a second it seemed as if Cal Poly had finally worn down the switch-heavy Gaucho defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, just as the Mustangs were poised to take the lead, UCSB kicked into another gear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s always about our defense,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained postgame. “Holding them to 37 percent from the field was the key to the game for us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos stifled Cal Poly in the last 10 minutes, but another important factor was cleaning up the glass to finish off their solid defensive possessions. UCSB ended with a 45-35 advantage in rebounding, and their +16 second-chance point margin showed that they didn’t allow the Mustangs to get multiple possessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With nine minutes left to go, junior guard Max Heidegger knocked down his only bucket of the game to put the Gauchos up two, and they never looked back, as the lead never went under five again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four clutch free throws by transfer guard Devearl Ramsey helped seal the game down the stretch, and threes by Armond Davis and Jaquori Mclaughlin ballooned the lead to double digits as the clock wore down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately this was a great win for the Gauchos to start off conference play. However, they know they have a long and arduous road ahead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every game we play… we don’t have a margin of error,” Pasternack said. “Every conference game moving ahead is gonna be more [difficult], every time we play it’s not gonna be easy.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 9, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

UCSB men’s basketball team enters Big West Conference play on a hot streak </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— this year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with an 11-3 overall record and the top spot in the Big West with half of the season now in the books. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ offense has been quarterbacked by dynamic backcourt duo sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and sophomore captain point guard Devearl Ramsey. Ramsey has contributed 11.2 points per game while averaging 3.8 assists, which is sixth best in the conference — not to mention he shoots the fifth highest mark from deep in the Big West with a three-point percentage of 42 percent.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McLaughlin compliments 10.9 points per contest with 3.5 assists per game, giving him the eighth highest number of average assists in the Big West conference. Ramsey and McLaughlin, a pair of sophomores, control the ball on the attack for the offense, but it is graduate guard Ar’Mond Davis who delivers the bulk of the scoring for the Gauchos with 14.2 points per game. Davis adds 5.4 rebounds per game as a multifaceted offensive threat that crashes the boards, along with freshman forward Amadou Sow.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of Sow, the freshman won his first career Big West Men’s Basketball Player of the Week award after a 21-point, nine-rebound performance against mid-major No. 10 University of San Francisco. Sow is the most efficient shooter in the Big West Conference, shooting 58.2 percent on field goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been flashes of stardom from the other two freshmen on the team as guard Sékou Touré has the highest player efficiency rating in the Big West and as forward Jay Nagle owns the third best three-point percentage in the conference with 46.2 percent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a well-rounded team for the Gauchos this season, the real question is who will face the wrath of Head Coach Joe Pasternack in his second season with Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look at all of the teams in the fight for the Big West crown:</span></p>\n<p><b>UC Irvine, 12-4</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters held the top spot in the conference for the majority of the first half of the season before losing a couple toward the end of their non-conference schedule. Neck and neck with the Gauchos, Irvine has earned the mid-major No. 15 spot with a 12-4 record, placing the team second in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eaters opened the year up 7-0 with big wins against Texas A&amp;M and Santa Clara. They followed it up with another impressive victory of 80-75 over Saint Mary’s College in late November but finished off their non-conference season with a pair of losses a month later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, this Irvine team has a remarkable rotation with a dangerous and experienced duo of guards in the backcourt in, thanks to junior guards Evan Leonard and Max Hazzard who bolster Irvine’s deadly three-point attacks. Irvine’s 36.2 percent from deep is ideal when competing against the first-place Gauchos, who allow just 28.1 percent from the three, the 13th best in the NCAA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI’s graduate forward Jonathan Galloway sits in the No. 2 spot of the Big West in rebounding with 7.3 boards per game while senior forward Elston Jones supports with 7.1 rebounds per game, fifth in the conference. The pair of big men patrol the paint as well as any frontcourt in the Big West, allowing just 66.6 points against per contest which ranks slightly below UCSB’s top mark of 64.3 average points allowed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters, who surrender just 38 percent of field goals from opponents, thrive on the defensive end with the best defensive shooting percentage in the Big West. This makes the Eaters the most significant threat against UCSB which currently shoots a conference best of 48.1 percent from the field this year.</span></p>\n<p><b>University of Hawaii, 9-5</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winners of three games straight, the Rainbow Warriors have emerged as legitimate contenders to make a run for the title of Big West Champion as they currently sit in third place heading into the latter half of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawaii has a solid collective of starters that can score the ball well, as four players average double-figures in points led by junior guard Eddie Stansberry who posts 13.2 points per game following a 26-point performance against Alabama A&amp;M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stansberry delivers the most scoring on average, it is sophomore guard Drew Buggs who strikes with a pass-first mentality. Buggs owns the second highest assists per game in the Big West, averaging 5.0 per contest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buggs has an array of weapons at his disposal with Stansberry running the wing but when the Warriors look to move the ball inside, junior Zigmars Raimo is the likely recipient.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raimo, a Latvia native, rebounds at the fifth highest rate in the Big West with 7.1 boards per game while shooting 57 percent from the field, placing him as third in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawaii recorded statement wins against University of Colorado at Boulder and Utah earlier in the non-conference half of the season to build up its resume and makes an underdog run for the Big West title come conference play. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cal State Northridge, 6-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 6-24 season, one of the most disappointing years in program history, Cal State Northridge wiped the slate clean with the hire of first year Head Coach Mark Gottfried, in addition to adding former NBA Champion Mo Williams to the assistant coaching staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new-look leadership is certainly a huge reason why the Matadors rank among the best offenses in the Big West, but without freshman phenom Lamine Diane, CSUN could be in the same position as the season prior.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane has catapulted CSUN into fourth place in the conference through his Big West best of 24.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. The freshman also ranks among the top defenders with 1.7 steals per game while blocking 2.3 shots on average, both coming in first in the Big West as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the CSUN attack doesn’t just rely on Diane’s two-way ability. While the freshman tops out the Big West as the No. 1 scorer, it is sophomore guard Terrell Gomez who delivers 18.4 points on average for the third best mark among Big West players. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complementing Gomez in the backcourt, freshman guard Darius Brown II produces a play-making boost with 5.1 assists per contest, another first place in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Irvine is UCSB’s biggest threat on the defensive end, the Matadors are certainly the top threat on offense with their harrowing attack. CSUN ties UCSB in first with 77.8 points per game while passing the ball better than any other team in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing holding CSUN back? Its sluggish defense. The Matadors are last in opponent field goal percentage, allowing a massive 82.9 points per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be some kinks to smooth out but CSUN is a contender for the long hall with a trio of young, ambitious attackers and new leadership at the helm.</span></p>\n<p><b>Long Beach State, 6-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tied for fourth in the conference with two other squads, the 49ers look to turn their season around come conference play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beach has relied on the dynamic offensive production by senior guard Deishuan Booker who has posted 14.2 points per contest, the third most in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the paint, redshirt senior center Temidayo Yussuf drags down 7.2 rebounds per game for the Niners as he contributes 12.9 points on average. Yussuf shoots at the seventh best rate in the Big West, knocking down 49.7 percent on field goals, but Long Beach still struggles offensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Niners have shot just 41.7 percent from the field this season, the lowest mark in the Big West, while they fail to take care of the ball as well, with conference-high 16.0 turnovers per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While CSUN appears to be in first-place contention for years to come with a trio of talented young players, Long Beach seems to be searching for its next generation of studs as all three of its top leading scorers are seniors and will depart from the program next year.</span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside, 5-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk about a team that can shoot the three well. Between junior guard Dikymbe Martin and sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy, the Highlanders have one of the most dangerous three-point duos in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin is the only double-digit scorer on the Highlanders with 15.9 points per game as the fifth best scorer in the conference, but he also hits on 44.8 percent from behind the arc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Kennedy, the sophomore out of Moreno Valley owns the most efficient three-point percentage in the conference, shooting 56.3 percent from deep along with his 7.5 points per game which is second on the Riverside roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just a hundredth of a percent behind UC Irvine, Riverside is second in the Big West in shooting from the perimeter with 37 percent but struggles to get second chance opportunities on misses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody on the Highlanders roster brings down over 4.5 rebounds per game as UCR is the second worst rebounding team in the Big West, solely in front of last-place UC Davis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expect minimal post play while jumpers are hoisted from deep since the Highlanders shoot the most three-pointers in the Big West. But who can blame them? With a pair of spot-up shooters like Martin and Kennedy, all eyes should be around the perimeter. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cal Poly, 4-9</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs have hit a metaphorical wall in the world of Big West basketball. The last time Cal Poly had a winning team was during the 2012-13 season and coming off a 9-22 year, Poly showed that this season is more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not all bad for the Mustangs who have a leader in senior point guard Donovan Fields who posts 15.8 points per game to go along with 4.3 assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, sophomore wing Mark Crowe is a dynamic threat from virtually anywhere on the floor as he shoots the fifth best rate from the field in the Big West while also splashing 51.6 percent from range, No. 2 in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, much like the Highlanders, Cal Poly doesn’t have a solid facilitator to protect the restricted area in its strife to get rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only two of Cal Poly’s four wins have come against Division I programs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of those schools is playing its first season in Division I.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cal State Fullerton, 4-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off of a Cinderella Big West Tournament last season that ultimately landed them in March Madness, Fullerton loaded its front half of the season with difficult matchups throughout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans have a pair of two of the most effective scorers in the Big West as seniors [[senior guards]] Kyle Allman Jr. and Khalil Ahmad pose significant threats to any defense. Allman Jr. adds 18.5 points per game while Ahmad follows close behind with 18.2 on average. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With junior forward Jackson Rowe averaging 7.2 rebounds per game in the post, the third most in the Big West, Fullerton seems to have all the bases covered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the lingering question remains: what the heck is this team doing wrong? My answer: playing teams that are, quite simply, better than them. Fullerton gets little to no production from its offense, barring the three aforementioned starters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, with a dangerous offense, don’t count out the Titans. CSUF looks like the ideal team to impede a playoff-hopeful team with its dynamic scoring duo, so make sure to remember the Titans when they face off against top teams in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis, 4-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting in dead last, the Aggies have suffered a heartbreaking year. Heading into 2018-19, Davis had eyed a repeat crown as Big West regular season champions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies returned every starter from last year’s first place roster, but the results are drastically different. Davis hasn’t won a game on the road this season, going a shocking 0-7 when playing away this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With senior forward AJ John out with an injury halfway through the season, senior guard and 2017-18 Big West MVP TJ Shorts II is left to bear the scoring burden. His 14.2 points per game just haven’t been enough to carry the Aggies’ struggling offense, which scores only 62.9 points each contest, the least in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies have trouble shooting from deep and have been unable to match teams on the boards with a -3.6 rebounding margin, another Big West Conference low. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On paper, the Aggies should be a fierce competitor with 2017-18 Coach of the Year Jim Les at the helm but on the hardwood, finding points have been slim pickings, something they hope will turn around come Big West play. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Big West Conference play for men’s basketball is set to begin this week, and what better way to start it off than with another exciting installment to the Blue-Green Rivalry.</p>\n<p>Bragging rights aside, this matchup is not only one of the most important on the Gauchos’ entire schedule but it’ll also prove vital for the team to start off conference basketball on the right foot.</p>\n<p>Entering this game, the Gauchos will be in fine form considering their current three-game win streak. Not to mention that the team will be fired up after their most recent record-breaking victory, as UCSB defeated Bethesda University by a score of 109-47; this 62-point margin was the largest in the school’s history.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the season, UCSB currently holds an 11-3 overall record. The Gauchos have also maintained a perfect record at home after being undefeated through seven games; they’ll look to extend and apply their home court dominance over Cal Poly as well.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ season hasn’t been nearly as favorable. The opposition holds a 4-9 overall record thus far; just above a .300 win percentage. They will be coming off a victory of their own, however, as they most recently defeated Holy Names University by a 68-47 final result. Prior to this, the Mustangs had experienced a four-game losing streak; one of which was an overtime heartbreaker at their own home.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have been the opposite of perfect when it comes to away games. Of the seven matches they’ve played on the road, Cal Poly has yet to win a single one of them.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, this will be the 114<sup>th</sup> time that these two teams have faced off against each other. In terms of all-time series, the Gauchos have the advantage as they lead the Mustangs by a record of 79-35. The last time that both these sides met was during the Big West Conference Tournament, where the quarterfinal confrontation was bested by UCSB with a final score of 75-53.</p>\n<p>After last week’s dominant performance, the Gauchos have now scored over 1,000 points on the season.</p>\n<p>A player to watch for the Gauchos is graduate guard Ar’mond Davis, who leads the team in total scoring with 199 points to his name. Freshman forward Amadou Sow also continues to shine as he leads the team in total rebounds with 90 on the season; he’s also second in blocks, with 10, and tied for fifth in steals, with 6.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Jay Nagle has also had a hot-hand lately. A key part in last game’s rout, Nagle finished with a game-leading 20 points. Just as important and only a score behind him was also freshman guard Sékou Touré, who protected the rim all night with 10 rebounds to go with his 18 points. Both players came off the bench in the last one, so it’ll be interesting to see what role the subs play in the upcoming conference matchup.</p>\n<p>Most of the Gauchos’ game-plan will have to be centered around the Mustangs’ leading scorer senior point guard Donovan Fields. The offense seems to run through his hands as Fields’ 206 total points and 56 total assists are both team-leading, and his team-leading 22 steals also shows his ability to step up on the other end as well.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Marcellus Garrick has also been on a tear for the Mustangs lately. Leading all scorers in their last game with 19 points, Garrick shot for 53% from field goal range, along with 50% from beyond the arc. A productive complement to Fields, it’ll be important for the Gauchos to not let either player get too open.</p>\n<p>Head coach Joe Pasternak has provided an injury update for Gaucho junior guard Max Heidegger, labeling his status as a “mild strain of his quad”. However, he was practicing Tuesday night, before the game, so his chances of league play look optimistic.</p>\n<p>With the conference play portion of the Big West set to begin, the all-games standings has UCSB sitting atop of the table at first place. Meanwhile, Cal Poly’s performance thus far places them in third-to-last place; this gulf in class is a clear indicator that this match should be in the Gauchos’ favor.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for this Wednesday, January 9<sup>th</sup>, in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. Come show your support for the Gauchos in this exciting Blue-Green Rivalry matchup!</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

comfortable as ever after winning three straight at home and finishing off non-conference play with a 109-47 monster victory over visiting Bethesda, the largest point differential in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>The 109 points posted by UCSB is the most points by a Gaucho team since a 109-point performance on Nov. 30, 1985.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Ami Lakoju and freshman standout Sekou Touré each contributed double-double performances in the win as six Gauchos scored in double-figures, securing the top spot in the Big West heading into conference play with an 11-3 overall record. Bethesda dropped its ninth straight to fall to 1-13 on the year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In Lakoju’s first start of the season, the senior posted 16 points which tied a career-high mark while adding 11 rebounds for a season-high performance on the boards. However, during a night when the Chos’ most senior player popped off for a career performance, it was the young Gaucho talent that put on a show for the home crowd.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Amadou Sow, Lakoju’s frontcourt counterpart, continued to impress as he returned to the hardwood with a 14-point performance in 13 minutes while shooting 5-6 from the field. This followed his 21-point, 9 rebound night against University of San Francisco which earned him Big West Conference Athlete of the Week last Monday on December 31st.</p>\n<p>Sow has been on a tear in his freshman season. Having started all 14 games for the Gauchos, he sits atop the Big West in field goal percentage shooting 58.2% and nabs 6.4 rebounds per game good for No. 7 in the conference.</p>\n<p>Amadou Sow isn’t the only Prolific Prep product that has been mesmerizing for the Gaucho faithful to follow this season however. Sekou Touré has been premier off the bench for UCSB, and he continued to impress with 18 points and 11 rebounds, each career-high marks in the Bethesda clobbering.</p>\n<p>Touré has the highest player efficiency rating in the Big West and has competed for the top spot in the NCAA the entire season while topping out at No. 5 in the country. While Touré poured in a magnificent performance off the bench, it was freshman Jay Nagle who stole the show in the second half.</p>\n<p>Nagle, a sniper from deep, erupted for a career-high 20 points off the bench while shooting 6-12 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>The freshman forward was recruited at 6-foot-6 inches, but following a growth spurt over the summer now towers at 6-foot-8, and has displayed his impressive range with the No. 3 three-point percentage in the Big West splashing 46.2% from the perimeter.</p>\n<p>The three Gaucho freshmen combined for 52 points and 20 rebounds in the seventh straight Thunderdome win as UCSB remains a perfect 7-0 at home this season.</p>\n<p>Following an underdog win over Mid-Major No.10 University of San Francisco to catapult UCSB into first place in the Big West, the Gauchos have been earning mid-major top-25 votes while dominating throughout their non-conference schedule.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos rank atop the Big West with 77.8 points scored per game while shooting a conference-best 48.1% on field goals. A +45 rebound margin in this last matchup also puts them at a +9.8 differential this season, another best in the Big West. With only 9 turnovers against Bethesda, and consecutive games with single-digit turnovers for the offense, the Gauchos also hold the lowest mark for giveaways in the conference heading into the second half of the season.</p>\n<p>For the second straight year under Joe Pasternack, UCSB heads into Big West play with an 11-3 record whilst sitting in the No. 1 spot of the conference as it shifts attention to familiar Big West foes.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will open Big West play at home in the Thunderdome against the Cal Poly Mustangs for the most recent chapter on the highly-anticipated Blue-Green Rivalry on Wednesday, January 9 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

With this loss, UCSB’s overall record on the year now stands at 8-3, and the team will be optimistic that their upcoming series of five consecutive home games will gift them a few more tallies in the win column; the Gauchos are currently undefeated when competing at the Thunderdome, with a 4-0 overall record when at home.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If the Gauchos successfully defend their home court, then that will be enough to bring the team back to  a .750 win percentage. In terms of how the team’s overall record fares in the Big West standings, the Gauchos are currently ranked second, three wins behind top of the table UC Irvine who have played three more games than them.</p>\n<p>As for Idaho State, the Bengals’ overall record is a split 4-4, good enough to place them in the middle of the Big Sky Conference standings. Idaho State will also be looking to return to form as they too are coming off a most recent loss. On Wednesday, the Bengals fell short to Utah Valley University, which ended in a 77-88 defeat on the road.</p>\n<p>This will be the sixth time that these programs have faced off against each other. The Gauchos just barely edge out the Bengals in regards to their all-time series record, with the blue and gold leading 3-2.</p>\n<p>Players to watch for the Gauchos are graduate guard Ar’mond Davis and junior guard Max Heidegger.</p>\n<p>Davis has been on an absolute tear as of late and leads the Gauchos in scoring with a total of 165 points to his name on the year, 36 points ahead of sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin who is in second place.</p>\n<p>As for Heidegger, he’s slowly returning to form after recently playing in his first two games of the season during the road trip that  just concluded. For the mean time, head coach Joe Pasternack will keep rotating between Heidegger and sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey to take care of backcourt duties.</p>\n<p>On the opposing end, Bengal junior guard Brandon Boyd leads his side in scoring for the season with 129 total points. Averaging 16.1 in points per game, Boyd also leads Idaho State in assists, with a total of 31 on the year. That being said, his turnover count is also team-leading and the Gauchos will want to game plan against such a knack for mistakes.</p>\n<p>Fans will be excited for the Gauchos’ return to the Thunderdome and the commencement of their long stay. In turn, men’s basketball would like to start their home series on the right foot and give supporters something to celebrate during this most wonderful time of the year.</p>\n<p>It’s a day game on the cards for the Gauchos, as men’s basketball is eager to host the visiting Idaho State Bengals. Tipoff is scheduled for 2 PM this Saturday, December 22, at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85409\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85409\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/","id":105,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[104,103,102],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Lineups Ahead?

After the game, UCSB will return home for a nice five-game home stand which stretches into the start of Big West play.</p>\n<p>On top of having just a 4-7 record to start the season, the Mavericks will have a tall task in front of them as UCSB’s star guard Max Heidegger has finally recovered from a concussion he sustained earlier this year. The junior made his return for the Gauchos last weekend in a 99-89 overtime win against Rice University after he missing the first nine games of the season.</p>\n<p>Nebraska Omaha sports three players who average double-digits in the points column with senior guard Zach Jackson spearheading the attack, averaging 18.1 points per contest on a very efficient 50.8% shooting from the field. He also adds 3.2 boards per game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jackson erupted for a season-high 33 points against Montana State on back in late November, but just this past Saturday, Idaho held him to a season-low six points. It was the first time this year Jackson was held under double figures.</p>\n<p>Junior guard JT Gibson is Jackson’s back court compliment who averages 13.9 points per game. In all but two games either Jackson or Gibson has led the team in scoring after each game.</p>\n<p>Jaquori McLaughlin will likely get the assignment on Jackson as he gets the most difficult defensive matchup game-by-game and usually excels in shutting down the opposing teams’ top scorer.</p>\n<p>Offensively, McLaughlin reaped the benefits of Heidegger’s return back to action as the sophomore accounted for 22 points in the win against Rice. Even more impressive, McLaughlin’s three-point shot finally came alive as he shot a season best 6-8 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>As for Heidegger the guard’s return to the court was near flawless. Not only did Heidegger improve the Gauchos offensive production with his scoring ability but his mere presence on the court stretches the floor and creates opportunities both on the perimeter and in the paint.</p>\n<p>Before Max’s return, team captain Devearl Ramsey was producing more with his ball distributing than his scoring ability, but with Heidegger on the floor, Ramsey was able to get more open looks from deep as he went 5-7 from the perimeter en route to a career-high 21 points.</p>\n<p>Against Rice, Ramsey contributed eight of the first 10 points in OT to ultimately clinch the win for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The most enticing aspect of Heidegger’s return has to be the uncertainty about the starting roster. While this Gaucho team is deeper than any UCSB squad in recent memory, is Joe Pasternack gutsy enough to have Heidegger come off the bench?</p>\n<p>Before Heidegger’s return, UCSB still held a very strong 7-2 overall record and were a few plays away from securing an upset win at Washington showing that this is a team that was able to produce throughout his absence.</p>\n<p>Heidegger improves the Gauchos offense when in the game highlighted by their season high 99-point performance on Saturday, but as a result the defense can sometimes suffer due to the junior guard’s tendency to constantly push the tempo and speed up the pace of play.</p>\n<p>The problem with playing at such a high pace is that it sometimes gives opponents the opportunity to match and put up more points. To that point, the Gauchos gave up a season high 89 points to the Owls.</p>\n<p>However, it’s tough to make the case against starting forwards senior Jarriesse Blackmon and graduate Armond Davis. According to ESPN’s college basketball index, Blackmon has the fourth highest player efficiency rating (PER), a measure that assesses a player’s production based on the minutes they play, in the Big West at 19.76 while Davis’s 18.49 PER follows close behind ranking sixth.</p>\n<p>Davis, Blackmon, and freshman forward Amadou Sow all post a top-15 PER in the Big West conference while Devearl Ramsey and Jaquori Mclaughlin are close behind. Funnily enough, freshman standout Sekou Toure has been the most efficient player in the Big West with a 33.57 PER which also ranks 10<sup>th</sup> in the country underlining how strong the Gauchos are all around.</p>\n<p>All this is to say that Head Coach Joe Pasternack has a litany of options this season, something that was a bit of a struggle last year. Last season, Heidegger played nearly 33 minutes a game, most nights more, and it caught up to him at the end of the season.</p>\n<p>This time around, Pasternack has a team that could go nearly 11-deep making them a major threat not just in the Big West but to any opponent. Heidegger’s talent obviously warrants him starting but now he no longer needs to play excessive minutes and some nights he could even come off the bench to give him a break.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, this Gaucho team is at full strength and it will be interesting to see what exactly that entails both at the start and off the bench.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face Nebraska Omaha at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, December 19 at Baxter Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Max Heidegger made his long-anticipated season debut in Houston, Texas on Saturday as the UCSB men’s basketball team held off the Rice University Owls in a 99-89 overtime thriller.</p>\n<p>Although questions arose about how the star guard would insert himself back into the Gauchos rotation, Heidegger’s return to the attack was as smooth as the Gauchos three-point stroke from deep. UCSB knocked down 48.6% of perimeter shots as they opened the game on a 12-0 run from four straight triples including two that came from sophomore Jaquori Mclaughlin.</p>\n<p>Mclaughlin finished with 22 points while shooting 7-10 on field goals. He hit on a game-high 6-8 from three in addition to tallying four assists in the process. His starting backcourt counterpart sophomore Devearl Ramsey was magnificent leading the Gaucho’s attack in crunch time, as he added 8 points right off the bat in overtime en route to a career-high 21-point night with five three pointers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[Devearl] had 3 assists and one turnover. All I care about is don’t turn the ball over,” chimed Head Coach Joe Pasternack after the game. “We get him to go 5-7 from three… that’s a bonus, that’s huge. We needed every single one of them.”</p>\n<p>Down 12 points within the first 2 minutes to open the game, the Owls clawed back and took command with a 31-7 stretch to put Rice up 31-19 with 4:21 to play in the first half. The scoring stretch was capped off by a three-point play by freshman guard Chris Mullins who added 21 points in 40 minutes for the Owls and while going 6-16 from the field.</p>\n<p>Each team traded jumpers as the half ticked to a close with Rice up by 10 in the final second. With just a flash of time on the clock, Heidegger muscled the ball past the timeline and drew a shooting foul from three with just .1 seconds left. The Oaks Christian High School product sunk all three free-throws and moved the Gauchos within 7, down 39-32 at the break.</p>\n<p>Heidegger immediately assumed a quarterback role in the attack whenever he came on the floor. In his return, the preseason first team All-Big West Conference honoree added 22 points in 29 minutes off of the bench while shooting 6-16 from the field.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho’s offense lit up at the start of the half as they opened up on a 13-2 scoring run in which Devearl Ramsey and Heidegger collaborated for 11 of 13 out of the gate in the second half.</p>\n<p>Just minutes after entering the half off the bench, Heidegger put an exclamation mark on the Gauchos opening push when he connected with consecutive threes as he launched the latter from over 35-feet out to put UCSB on top for the first time since the 11-minute mark in the first half.</p>\n<p>Following a trio of free-throws from graduate guard Armond Davis with 13:16 on the clock, the momentum had officially shifted as the visiting Gaucho’s had now taken a 50-45 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB silenced the crowd with its suffocating defense on the ensuing possession which forced a telegraphed pass from freshman guard Trey Murphy III. Just in front of the midline, senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon jumped in front of Murphy’s feed and finished with a flush in transition on the other end.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos continued their offensive production spearheaded by the Mclaughlin-Heidegger attack in the second half, Chris Mullins and junior Robert Martin finished with 10 and 11 points respectively to set the scene for a last-ditch comeback in the final 4 minutes.</p>\n<p>Following a quick release trey from Mclaughlin with 3:41 left on the clock, the Owls finished off regulation with a 9-2 run that sent the Saturday matinee matchup into overtime at 77-77.</p>\n<p>Devearl Ramsey took matters into his own hands as the game made its way into extra time. Ramsey dazzled by adding 8 points in the first minute and a half as he splashed two from downtown along with a driving teardrop at the rack to put UCSB up 87-82.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos carried their lead to the finish line as they went 10-10 from the stripe in overtime to close out the thriller. SB hit 23 of 24 free throws compared to the Owls who went 18-34 from the line.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter who you’re playing; the same things matter. Do you hit your free throws on the road? In Washington we didn’t. Here we went 23 of 24 from the free throw line,” said Coach Pasternack. “You can’t turn the ball over on the road and we had nine turnovers; one of our best performances of the year.”</p>\n<p>Five Gauchos finished in double-digits with Heidegger, Mclaughlin, and Devearl Ramsey all ending the night with more than 20 points. Armond Davis joined in with 10 while freshman forward Amadou Sow went a perfect 6-6 from the field on his way to a 12-point night.</p>\n<p>The ‘Chos away game at Rice was Santa Barbara’s penultimate non-conference road game as they head to Omaha, Nebraska to take on University of Nebraska Omaha at the Baxter Arena on Wednesday, December 19 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85392\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85392\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/","id":1041,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1040,1039,1038],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":7,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
