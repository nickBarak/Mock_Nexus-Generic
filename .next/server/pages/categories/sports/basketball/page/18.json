The two teams traded buckets until 9:39 when 49er freshman guard Loren Jackson made the three-pointer that started the Long Beach lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the half went on, the scoring slowed down as both teams struggled to find a solid squad on the court, moving many players on and off the bench. The last 1:12 of the first half solidified Long Beach’s lead as they increased their score by six points, four of which being completed foul shots by junior forward Roschon Prince. UCSB junior guard Tide Osifeso managed to land a three-pointer with two seconds left, finishing off the first half being 37-47.</span></p>\n<p>The 49ers had kept a small but steady lead during the latter part of the half but where they managed to outplay the Gauchos was in the details of the game. Although the two were tied in team rebounds, the Long Beach players managed to use more assists, make more blocks, and collectively have three less turnovers than UCSB, resulting in their 10-point lead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ending the first half, the top three scorers in the game all belonged to LBSU. Yussuf lead the board with 12 points, followed closely by junior guard Evan Payne with 10, and sophomore guard Noah Blackwell with eight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going into the second half, the Gauchos certainly had their work cut out for them. UCSB came into the period looking strong, scoring six points in under a minute at 16:52, but the 49ers were not about to let the score get too close, working back up to a nine-point lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the 15th minute to 11:45 left in the game, only two baskets were made: a free throw from UCSB junior forward Alex Hart and a three-pointer from Osifeso. This period of time was otherwise characterized by numerous missed shots on both sides of the court as well as a couple fouls from either team as the players began to fatigue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scoring became significantly less frequent in the last 10 minutes of the game. While Yussuf and a handful of other 49ers traded off scoring, senior guard Eric Childress single-handedly powered through for the Gauchos. Childress scored 11 points, nine of which were uninterrupted by any of his teammates, as the clock ran down. </span></p>\n<p>At 3:45 the Gauchos caught up to the 49ers off a layup from Childress, putting the score at 70-70. Unfortunately, UCSB did not have quite enough steam to take a lead despite the valiant efforts of Hart, who grabbed four boards and made two jump-shots in the last few moments.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it was not reflected in the final score, the Gauchos managed to outscore the 49ers in the second half 39 points to 34. Both teams worked hard and by the end of the game had totaled a similar number of rebounds, assists, and turnovers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losing only by five points, it was a close and well-fought match-up, but the 49ers consistently made more baskets making 46.4 percent of their shots while the Gauchos were only successful on 39.3 percent of theirs taken. </span></p>\n<p>Although LBSU would have been a definite step forward, the Gauchos have a chance to redeem themselves Saturday night when they play UC Riverside who is 4-11 overall despite their two-game winning streak.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/","id":304,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[303,302,301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Third-Straight, Stun LBSU At Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_1-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winning its third consecutive game, the UCSB women's basketball team improved to 8-9 and 3-1 in the Big West to tie for second in the conference standings after defeating LBSU Thursday night.

It was also the first time this season that two Gauchos tallied double-doubles. Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman concluded Thursday’s game with 10 points and 10 rebounds for her fourth career double-double.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler tied her career-high of 14 points on 6-for-12 shooting and a game-high six assists. Meanwhile senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe ended with 10 points and five assists.</p>\n<p>Much credit is due to the UCSB defense as its pressure led to a 5-for-21 three-point shooting performance by Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Following a quick two-for-two start to the game on layups by Edelman, UCSB went cold from the field, missing three consecutive three-point attempts and trailed 9-5.</p>\n<p>Helping Long Beach State embark on its quick start was the three-point shooting of junior guard Cece Wilson, who hit back-to-back long range shots. Wilson had 10 points on 4-for-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Knocking down UCSB’s first long range basket at the 5:40 mark of the first quarter was Porter, which sparked the Gauchos 13-5 run to close out the first quarter as they shot 50 percent from both the field and behind the perimeter on 7-for-14 and 3-6 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>Porter set the tone for the Gauchos by going on an 8-1 run of her own during the stretch of points. She ended the period three-for-three shooting and two-for-two from beyond the arc as UCSB ended the period with an 18-14 lead.</p>\n<p>Prior to that, UCSB took a 16-14 lead after a made three-pointer by Miller. It would maintain the lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ largest first half lead was of seven points with a 25-18 lead which resulted from a three-point make from sophomore guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>However, the 49ers did not allow the deficit to expand as they went on a 6-0 run to cut UCSB’s lead to 25-24. Leading Long Beach’s run was senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer, scoring each point.</p>\n<p>Sawyer scored 10 of her game-high 20 points in the second quarter, making five-of-six shots in the period. She ended the game 9-for-10 from the field and grabbed seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB managed to enter the half with a 32-31 lead after a made jumpshot by Miller.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the game with 16 turnovers as it occasionally had its difficulties with the 49ers’ full court press throughout the game but was able to overcome them.</p>\n<p>UCSB remained consistent from behind the perimeter as two of its first three field goals were three-pointers by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and Porter to open the second half.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s success from three-point range in the third quarter, going 3-for-6 from deep and 6-for-14 overall, helped it to sustain a lead of 47-41 entering the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>The final period was the Beach’s best period as they scored a total of 19 points. Despite scoring one field goal in the third period, Sawyer made it a two-point deficit at 49-47 with a made layup.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest shots of the game was a three-point make by Jemerigbe which was UCSB’s first basket of the quarter, but was a crucial basket that provided a cushion as it extended the Gauchos’ lead to 52-47.</p>\n<p>Both teams would go on to trade scores as LBSU would get its last chance to either trim its deficit or tie with a three, but a missed three-point attempt senior forward Madison Montgomery.</p>\n<p>An 11-for-12 performance at the free-throw line in the fourth quarter helped seal the deal as Jemerigbe and Porter both were clutch, going 4-for-4 to secure the win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play the final game of its home stand vs. Hawaii this Saturday, Jan. 21 at 4 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The hot shooting hand coming into tonight’s game is redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Porter is the Gauchos’ leading scorer since the start of Big West play at 14.0 points per game. She is coming off a career-high performance of 22 points, four three-pointers made, four steals and six free-throws made in the team’s 58-54 win over UC Riverside on Saturday.</p>\n<p>In addition to the victory, she earned her first ever Big West Athlete of the Week award.</p>\n<p>Porter has established herself as one of UCSB’s sharpshooters alongside sophomore guard Coco Miller as both are tied for the team lead in three-pointers made at 35 apiece, which ties them for the third most three-point makes in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Distributing the ball to these shooters has been the precise court vision of UCSB’s backcourt duo of point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe places in second and Toler in third in assists per game at 4.4 and 4.2, respectively; the two have combined for a total of 138 assists.<br>\n“We’ve talked a lot as a staff and with our players about improving our decsion making,” Henrickson explained. “Whether we should drive it, should we drive it baseline, or should we drive it middle? No great shooter ever stands still. Your job is to reward the player that’s driving and sucking up some defense to find a window and moving without the ball. We’re an unselfish group. We recognize it’s not your shot, it’s our shot.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were stellar on the defensive end as well, recording season-highs of 16 steals and 24 forced turnovers, respectively. Through three conference games, UCSB leads the Big West in forced turnovers per game at an average of 18.0.</p>\n<p>“For us to be disruptive, get our hands on[the ball], and increase the number of turnovers that we create [will be important],” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>However, Long Beach State presents a dual threat on both ends of the court, owning an overall conference best average of 21.1 forced turnovers per game, and they have been efficient when possessing the ball with just 14.7 turnovers per game for second best.</p>\n<p>Boasting a 39.7 three-point percentage, which ranks second best in the conference, the 49ers visit with tons of momentum shooting the ball after knocking down 14 three-pointers, second most in a single-game in program history, in their 83-80 victory over Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Beach concluded the game with a season-high 50.9 field goal percentage and was led by the outstanding play of senior point guard Anna Kim, who had 25 points on 7-for-10 and 4-5 three-point shooting, four rebounds, five assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Despite not being one of the 49ers’ double-figure scorers, Kim has managed to be effective with her shot selection as she leads both the Big West and Long Beach State with a 50.0 three-point percentage, holds the team lead in field goal percentage at 46.5 and plays the most minutes per game with a 26.4 average.</p>\n<p>At the core of the 49ers’ offense, helping create space around the perimeter is senior forward Madison Montgomery.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s leading scorer at 11.3 PPG, Montgomery is most effective defending the ball in the paint.<br>\nShe ranks fifth in the Big West in both blocks per game and total blocks at 1.2 and 22, respectively.</p>\n<p>Montgomery can stretch the floor as well, tied for third on the team in three-pointers made at 15 with senior guard Raven Benton.</p>\n<p>Success from beyond the arc is pivotal for both teams in this matchup as the 49ers own a conference high in three-pointers made at 155.<br>\nMeanwhile, the Gauchos have defended the long distance shot superbly, allowing just 65 made three-pointers and ranking third in three-point defense at 28.8 percent.</p>\n<p>“You have to recognize personnel. If you cushion them, they have players that go ‘hand down, man down’ and will shoot it on you,” Henrickson said. “If you go under an on-ball screen, they’re going to shoot behind it. If you make a mistake and don’t know that you’re guarding a shooter and there’s penetration coming at you, you have to ball side deny and that help has got to come from the back side.”</p>\n<p>Going against a Long Beach State team that has the ability to get hot from long range, UCSB will have to remain committed to the importance of on-ball pressure in hopes of preventing any type of shooting rhythm for the 49ers’ offense.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s matchup between UCSB and Long Beach State will begin tonight at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/","id":300,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[299,298,297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looking to Pick Up Second Big West Win at LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After finally halting their three-game losing streak, the Gauchos will look to keep the ball rolling when they head to Long Beach to face the struggling 49ers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74872\" style=\"width: 532px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74872\" data-attachment-id=\"74872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/christian-terrell-dribbles-around-a-defender-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christian Terrell dribbles around a defender.

Having lost four of its last five games, LBSU will definitely be hungry to defend its home court in this match-up where it is a solid 6-1.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year the 49ers beat the Gauchos at home and away, both games high scoring with final results in the 70s. Those two victories turned out to be very beneficial for the 49ers, who finished the 2015-16 Big West conference in third place in the conference standings, going 12-4 Big West, while the Gauchos came in just behind them in fourth with an 11-5 Big West record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although neither team has been particularly strong this year, there is still plenty of conference play left. Overall, Long Beach has been solid on offense, averaging 73.8 points per game, which is the third-best mark in the conference, while also holding down the best free-throw percentage as a team with a 73.5 mark. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its four conference games this season, Long Beach State has scored an average of 81.5 points per game, a Big West high. However, its defense has been its Achilles heel; it has allowed the most points per game (87.2) while also giving up an astonishingly high three-point percentage at (41.2), both conference worsts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard Justin Bibbins currently leads the 49ers in minutes played, averaging 31.6 per game, as well as in assists with 82 so far in the season. Last year he earned second team all-Big West honors as he played in all 33 games as the Long Beach main point guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Bibbins’ fellow starters, junior guard Evan Payne, has averaged 14.7 points per game in the season and now 15.5 per game in conference. With junior forwards Gabe Levin and Roschon Prince grabbing 99 and 109 rebounds respectively, the starting lineup for Long Beach will present a challenge for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last game against Cal Poly, junior forward Alex Hart stepped up to lead the Gauchos to victory, scoring 15 points and grabbing 11 boards in his 36 minutes of playing time. With junior forwards Jalen Canty and Ami Lakoju unable to play, it is up to Hart and sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak to rise to the challenge of being UCSB’s “bigs” under the basket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman guard Clifton Powell Jr. has been electric on the court. Having started two out of the Gauchos’ three conference games so far, he has a conference field goal percentage of 45.1, proving to be a real asset when the pressure is on. This came to fruition again in Saturday’s win as Powell knocked down two big three balls — the only threes by the Gauchos that night — proving to be the difference in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from up and coming younger players, junior guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Eric Childress are still holding down the fort as reliable and seasoned veterans despite their combined score of 12 points in their most recent game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the 49ers and the Gauchos have experienced a rough season so far, but as the conference has only begun, both teams are eager to gain better footing through another win tomorrow night. With talented players to watch on both sides of the court, the Long Beach-UCSB match up will not be one to miss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB and LBSU tip-off is at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 19 in the Walter Pyramid Arena.

With a current 2-0 Big West record, the Highlanders have now won 18 consecutive conference games.</p>\n<p>Allowing a combined 175 points in its two losses to the Highlanders last season, UCSB is committed to improving on the defensive end in attempt to contain the orderly ball movement and quickness of UCR’s potent offense.</p>\n<p>With the nearly uncontainable Brittany Crain, former two-time Big West Player of the Year and star player who put up a combined 56 points in two wins over UCSB last year  no longer in a Highlanders’ uniform, the Gauchos have one less worry to conquer in facing UCR’s arsenal of scorers.</p>\n<p>Following last season’s finish as one of the conference’s top defenses, UCSB has remained consistent defending the ball. The Gauchos are the third best scoring defense in the Big West, allowing just 64.0 point per game.</p>\n<p>Saturday has the potential to be a defensive battle as the Highlanders sit atop the conference in points allowed per contest, allowing 63.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Since the start of Big West play, UC Riverside has matched its stoutness on defense with improvements on offense as well. In two conference games, UCR is tied in scoring with an average of 72.0 points per game.</p>\n<p>A team that boasts three double figure scorers, at the forefront of the Highlanders’ offense is the versatile talent of senior forward Réjane Vérin.</p>\n<p>UCR’s power in the paint, Vérin leads the Big West in both scoring and assists per game at averages of 17.1 and 4.5, respectively. She is also known for her hustle on the boards as her 8.1 rebounds per game places her second in the league.</p>\n<p>Vérin has flat out been the best player in Big West play thus far, averaging a conference leading 23.0 points and 10.5 rebounds per game, respectively. Leading UCR’s frontcourt, she has tallied four double-doubles in addition to scoring 20-plus points in six games this season.</p>\n<p>Aiding Vérin is the backcourt duo of senior guard Simone DeCoud and junior guard Lauren Holt. With higher expectations placed upon them entering this season, both have emerged to help carry the offensive load for UC Riverside, averaging 12.5 and 12.4 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>Most notably, both have been impressive on the defensive end of the court as well after playing in two conference games. Since the beginning of Big West play, DeCoud and Holt each average 2.0 steals per game, tying for fourth most in the conference.</p>\n<p>In preparing to face a team that can be productive on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball, UCSB must remain committed to its pace of offense and not allow UCR’s fast paced strategy to dismantle its possessions as the Highlanders possess a conference leading 6.1 steals per game.</p>\n<p>Known for operating its offense around its shooters, UCSB plays at its highest level when it can knock down the three.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ last four games they have made at least six three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Typically known for her driving ability, senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe has been efficient from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>She currently leads the Big West in three-point percentage with a 45.9 average and is coming off a 3-for-3 performance from beyond the arc in UCSB victory over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Also within the Gauchos’ split of games during their pair of conference openers was the outstanding three-point shooting of sophomore guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in scoring with 11.3 points per game, Miller made a career-high seven shots from behind the perimeter to end the game with 23 points in UCSB’s loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Helping spark the Gauchos’ three-point shooting has been the assisting of both Jemerigbe and redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. Since the start of Big West play, Jemerigbe is tied for the conference lead with Vérin at 5.5 assists per game. Off by just .5 of a mark is Toler at 5.0 helpers per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Riverside will tip-off this Saturday, Jan. 14  at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/","id":292,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[291,290,289],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2016-17 Big West Women’s Basketball Conference Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=683%2C333&ssl=1","description":"Big West play is now officially upon us, and with that, the Daily Nexus Sports staff releases their annual Big West preview.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74778\" style=\"width: 457px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74778\" data-attachment-id=\"74778\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/big-west-wbb-16-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?fit=683%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"683,333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"big-west-wbb-16-17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?fit=250%2C122&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?fit=683%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74778\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=447%2C218\" alt=\"Kevin Son / Daily Nexus\" width=\"447\" height=\"218\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=250%2C122&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Son / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A new year means a fresh start for everyone. And in some cases, a fresh start is exactly what some teams need now that conference play has come to the forefront of the action. With championship bragging rights and a NCAA invitation bid on the line, these nine Big West foes will be battling all season in order to prove they are the better team, at least for this year. Whether UC Riverside will repeat as champs, or another squad will dethrone them, one thing is for sure, these conference match-ups will be some of the most intense basketball these teams have faced all season. With that being said the Daily Nexus Sports Staff presents a preview of each Big West squad, enjoy! <strong><em>Note: With the exception of UCSB, who was ranked No. 4, the rest of the teams are ordered from first to last according to the Big West coaches preseason polls.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Barbara – Sean White </strong></p>\n<p>Now two games into its Big West Conference schedule, currently 6-9 overall and 1-1 in conference play, the UCSB women’s basketball team is hoping to build upon last year’s postseason return.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos returned to the Big West Conference Tournament for the first time since 2013 after a 12-20, 8-8 conference finish last season. Winners in four of its last six games, UCSB managed to gain some momentum after going on a three-game winning streak but was unable to sustain its momentum heading into conference play with a 64-60 loss in its final nonconference game to Yale.</p>\n<p>Projected to finish seventh in the Big West Preseason Media Poll, the Gauchos are better geared for the conference schedule after an improved nonconference finish in year two with Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. Santa Barbara improved by one win after a 4-12 nonconference finish during its 2015-16 campaign.</p>\n<p>Set to begin a three-game home stand versus UC Riverside this Saturday, UCSB’s home stay at the Thunderdome is a pivotal opportunity for the Gauchos to move up in the conference rankings.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Gauchos allow an average of 60.2 points per game when playing at home. UCSB has crafted one of the toughest defenses in the Big West as it ranks second in points allowed per game (64.0) and third in opponent three-point percentage (28.8).</p>\n<p>Although UCSB hasn’t found much consistency offensively, ranking third last in scoring with a PPG average of 60.1, the emergence of sophomore guard Coco Miller has been significant in the team’s performance.</p>\n<p>Miller leads the Gauchos in scoring at 11.3 PPG. She has already tied her previous season-high mark of two 20-plus point games after recording a career-high 24 points versus Pepperdine and 23 points on the road at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The addition of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman has provided the Gauchos with a post presence, a feature that had been missing on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s 53.4 field goal percentage ranks third in the Big West. She has tallied three double-doubles thus far and recorded a career-high 20 points in the Gauchos’ victory over NAU earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 14 at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Ryan Burns </strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Long Beach women’s basketball team has enjoyed an impressive start to their season at 10-6 overall, 1-0 Big West, including a pair of wins over LMU and Nevada, proving themselves as an early contender for the Big West Crown. The Niners have also been tested against the nation’s very top teams including Duke and Florida, gaining valuable experience on the biggest stage.</p>\n<p>The team is led by senior forward Madison Montgomery who leads the team with 11.4 ppg on .456 shooting percentage, also a team high. The forward has shown marked improvement since last season when she finished the year with 8.6 points a game on .376 shooting. Behind Montgomery stand senior guard Raven Benton (10.2 ppg) and senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer, the team’s leading rebounder with 6.9 boards per game.</p>\n<p>The trio of seniors link up to form a strong core of a team with high ambitions, hoping to leave with titles to show for their 49ers careers following last year’s 24-9 finish (12-4 BWC). Coming off a loss to Hawaii in the conference tournament and Oregon in the WNIT, leaving them with a bit of revenge to seek as Big West play tips off.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>No doubt, one of the biggest threats in the Big West women’s conference this season is the UC Davis squad, which was expected to finish in second place behind LBSU in the Big West standings at season’s end.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have put together a solid year thus far, boasting an 11-4 overall record and a 2-0 start in conference play after blowout wins against UC Irvine and Hawaii. They are also currently winners of five of their last six games.</p>\n<p>Although UC Davis only has five upperclassmen on the roster, the team is not short on talent. One example of this is redshirt sophomore Morgan Bertsch, who is following up an excellent rookie campaign with an even better second year as she is leading the Big West in points per game with 17.5. She also leads her squad in rebounding with 5.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>This year, the Aggies have been great on the offensive end as a team outscoring their opponents by over 100 points at 1097-969. They currently lead the Big West in points per game with 73.1 and currently hold the best assists per game as well at 17.1.</p>\n<p>UC Davis will face off against Long Beach State in what could be the game that decides the Big West winner on Thursday, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Andrew Hernandez</strong></p>\n<p>Coming off of a disappointing early playoff exit in the 2016 Big West Conference tournament, the UC Riverside Highlanders look to repeat as Big West Conference regular season champions despite losing two-time Big West Player of the Year Brittany Crain.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders won their home Big West opener and are currently 1-0 in conference play, looking to leave behind a 7-7 record in nonconference play. The Highlanders’ win increased their regular season game winning streak — which dates back to last season — to 17.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have been depending on seniors Réjane Vérin and Simone DeCoud, who were on the 2016 Big West Conference First and Second Teams, respectively, to lead their offense.</p>\n<p>“Vérin and DeCoud are the engines that drives our team’s success,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “We need them to produce with consistency for us to be successful and to allow our role players to fill in and contribute.”</p>\n<p>Vèrin, the team’s starting forward, scored 21 points, hauled in 10 rebounds and had seven assists in the Highlanders’ last game. The talented senior is currently leading the team in the blocks, points, assists and rebounds per game categories. Senior guard DeCoud is right behind Vérin as she is second in those same categories.</p>\n<p>UCR continues its road to Big West dominance when it faces Cal Poly in its second conference game of the season tonight at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>Capturing its seventh NCAA Tournament bid and first Big West Championship title since 1996 last season, the University of Hawaii has big shoes to fill following the departure of its five seniors and a 21-11 finish.</p>\n<p>Projected to land in the middle of the pack, selected to finish in fifth place in the preseason coaches’ poll, Head Coach Laura Beeman is mindful of the time it takes young teams like hers to develop and replicate a winning culture.</p>\n<p>“We’ve put last year behind us,” Beeman said. “We’re a totally different team now with new players looking to establish their own identity. We want to formulate our own traditions and use that as a springboard for this season and the next.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine sit at 4-10 on the year and 0-2 in conference play following a 68-57 loss to league favorite Long Beach State last Thursday.</p>\n<p>With a team that featured three All-Big West selections last year including Big West All-Tournament MVP Ashleigh Karaitiana, the pressure is on for upperclassmen junior guard Sarah Toeaina and senior point guard Briana Harris. Toeaina has emerged as an offensive catalyst for the Rainbow Wahine averaging 11.8 ppg. Hawaii will face Fullerton this Thursday at 7 p.m. HT.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>Since winning back-to-back Big West tournament titles in 2014 and 2015, Cal State Northridge’s reign at the top of the conference has gradually diminished. The loss of talent after winning its pair of conference titles is what influenced CSUN’s downward spiral last season.</p>\n<p>After a fairly dreadful 2015-16 season in which the Matadors finished 7-24 and 5-11 in conference play, this season has certainly been an improvement for a young team featuring only one senior.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 8-8, 1-1 in the Big West, the Matadors are up showing many naysayers by being at the .500 mark. Despite not being consistent enough to achieve a winning streak beyond two games, Northridge has still played strong following its losses. Only twice this season has the team lost consecutive games.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the Mustangs’ Big West slate saw them handle Cal State Fullerton 58-41, before falling to Cal Poly 79-68. Sophomore center Channon Fluker has paced her team in points, scoring 15.3 per game on 49.3 percent shooting in just over 24 minutes per contest. She also averages a double-double, raking in a conference leading 11.1 rebounds a game, which also ranks as the most on her team by a sizable margin.</p>\n<p>Fluker’s post game is accompanied by redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe’s perimeter shooting ability, as her 39 three-pointers made leads for the team and contributed to her average of 11.5 points per contest.Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Despite several impressive performances on the year, including losing to Michigan State (12-4) by only four points, two-time Big West Coach of the Year Jason Flowers, and the Matadors seem to have a viable chance to return to their winning ways in 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball may not have begun their 2016-2017 season the way they wanted to, but they are now currently tied with UC Davis for first place in the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>After Saturday’s 79-68 win over the visiting CSUN Matadors, Cal Poly is off to an impressive 2-0 start in Conference play. This turnaround mentality is exactly what the Mustangs were looking for as they exited the preseason at a meager 4-8.</p>\n<p>“Our pre-season had quite a few challenges. I would have hoped that we would have learned at a quicker pace considering that we had so many returners,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “The good news is that we have been learning and improving.”</p>\n<p>The improvements are evident as three different players have found themselves in the top 5 of the Big West’s Individual Offense Leaders category.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe places fifth overall points per game for the Big West (14.9), just as her sister, junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, is second overall in Rebounds per Game (8.1). Coach Mimnaugh is impressed with the initiative these twins convey and how their talent complements the skills of fellow teammates.</p>\n<p>The third offensive leader is senior forward Hannah Gilbert, who is also praised for her defensive ability. Coach Mimnaugh also believes that Gilbert’s performance so far should warrant her consideration for Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Mustangs current showing promotes the notion that the team is headed in the right direction whilst being led by a splendid coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“We have an unselfish, hard-working group who have bought into the roles they play … a great sign for continuing to strengthen chemistry and teamwork,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>This week, Cal Poly will look to extend their undefeated streak on Thursday, Jan. 12, on the road against UC Riverside at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>It was only three years ago that the UC Irvine women’s basketball team picked to finish eighth in the Big West preseason poll, surprised everyone by going 9-7 in conference play and managing to pick up a postseason victory in an overtime game against UC Davis in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Picked again to finish eighth this year, that recent history suggests it would be foolish to assume that the Anteaters will meekly fall into their predicted position.</p>\n<p>Early returns indicate that if UC Irvine does indeed defy this year’s preseason predictions, it might be in the opposite direction of what they did in 2013-14. The Anteaters entered conference play sporting a conference-worst 2-12 record and two ugly losses to UC Davis by a score of 89-48 and UC Riverside 76-58 haven’t helped matters.</p>\n<p>If Irvine stands a chance of turning things around and emulating that 2013-14 season, it will be on the strength of senior Shereen Sutherland, junior Sabrina Engelstad and sophomore Andee Ritter who are all averaging double digits in points per game.</p>\n<p>Sutherland, a 6’2” forward, is averaging a team-high 6.9 rebounds per game, while Engelstad leads the squad in blocks. Rounding out the trio, Ritter has come up with a team-leading 2.3 steals per game.</p>\n<p>These three players will be the key to a massive turnaround for first-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue’s team. The Anteaters have not helped themselves much so far this year, but UC Irvine of all teams should know that it’s still possible to defy expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>After a tough 2015-16 season, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team has entered conference play with a two-game losing streak but looks to improve as the season progresses. So far, they sit at a 3-12 record, similar to their overall record of 3-27 last year.</p>\n<p>Despite recent losses, the team has increased their average points scored per game from 55.8 to 60.7 and improved their field goal percentage from 35.5 to 37.9 since last year.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ top scorers — senior guard Iman Lathan, junior center Daeja Smith, and senior guard Jordan Jackson — lead their team despite having not played last season. Grabbing a combined score of 38 points in their most recent conference game against the Gauchos, they also have the most playing time alongside sophomore guard Jade Vega and senior guard China Henderson.</p>\n<p>With only three wins under their belt this season, the Cal State Fullerton Titans have room to improve their record and play on the court. Their next game will be at the University of Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 12.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74737\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74737\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/","id":293,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[292,291,290],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Eyeing First Conference Win of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-5.07.54-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-5.07.54-PM.png?resize=957%2C568&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on UCI at the Thunderdome tonight in hopes of picking up their first conference win of the season and its third win overall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Desperate to turn around what has been a lackluster season thus far, the UCSB men’s basketball team will have a great opportunity tonight as it faces off against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hosts the visiting Irvine team with an overall record of 2-11 so far and a 0-1 start to Big West play after a blowout loss of 73-47 at UC Davis last Wednesday.

Despite UCSB holding a 51-35 advantage all-time over UCI, the two teams have certainly been evenly matched over the past four years, splitting their last eight match-ups.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are the hotter team coming into this match, as they are winners of their last four ball games in which they averaged 82.2 points per game and outscored their opponents 329-223.</p>\n<p>As a team, UC Irvine’s stats rank among some of the best in the Big West in different categories, proving it is a team that can excel in all facets of the game, as it is second in the league in blocks per game (3.8), third in rebounds per game (39.2) and fourth in assists per game (13.2).</p>\n<p>Irvine’s scoring leader this season has been senior guard Jaron Martin who scores the sixth-most points per game in the conference, averaging 14 a game. On the rebounding side, sophomore forward Jonathan Galloway who ranks third in the Big West — second if you exclude UCSB’s junior forward Jalen Canty who is out indefinitely due to academic ineligibility — averaging 6.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the court, UCSB ranks among the bottom in many of the major categories in the Big West. This season, the Gauchos are eighth place in the conference in points per game (64.2), steals (5.0) and rank dead last in field goal percentage (36.7), three-point percentage (27.8) and free-throw percentage (61.4). In fact, Santa Barbara’s field goal percentage and three-point percentage rank 344 out of the 347 teams in Division I College Basketball, while its free-throw percentage ranks 341st.</p>\n<p>One of the two stats that which the Gauchos rank near the top in is rebounds per game. They are currently second in the Big West in that category averaging 39.4 boards as a team, but with the losses of their two best big man down low, Canty, and sophomore forward Ami Lakoju, to academic ineligibility, one could only surmise that they will not fare well much longer.</p>\n<p>If UCSB has any hope tonight, then it will need a big game from junior guard Gabe Vincent. The former Big West Freshman of the Year is the team’s leading scorer and the Big West’s second-best scorer averaging 15.8 points per game. In five home games this season, Vincent has done significantly better from three-point range, shooting 36 percent from the field as opposed to 27.7 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Guard Max Heidegger would also be a welcomed addition. The true freshman has been a bit inconsistent this season but has certainly shown flashes of greatness, scoring 21 points in an overtime home victory against Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>With a lackluster start comes huge scrutiny, and no one is facing more of Head Coach Bob Williams. Many fans have taken to social media to show their distaste for Williams after such a bad start to the season.</p>\n<p>However, winning changes all fortunes and a huge victory against UC Irvine tonight would be a huge step in the right direction for everyone involved with this program.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UC Irvine at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 12 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

And in some cases, a fresh start is exactly what some teams need now that conference play has come to the forefront of the action. With championship bragging rights and a NCAA invitation bid on the line, these nine Big West foes will be battling all season in order to prove they are the better team, at least for this year. Whether Hawaii will repeat as champs, or another squad will dethrone them, one thing is for sure, these conference match-ups will be some of the most intense basketball these teams have faced all season. With that being said the Daily Nexus Sports Staff presents a preview of each Big West squad, enjoy! <strong><em>Note: With the exception of UCSB, who was ranked No. 4, the rest of the teams are ordered from first to last according to the Big West media preseason polls. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Barbara – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>The 2016-17 campaign has not been off to an ideal start for the UCSB men’s basketball team, which currently sits at 2-11 overall and 0-1 in the Big West after a blowout loss at UC Davis last Wednesday 73-47. However, one could only hope that now that conference play is in full effect, the Gauchos can look to turn around their tough start to the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara has two big pieces that could help change the fortune of the season in guards Eric Childress and Gabe Vincent. Vincent, a junior, is currently second in the Big West in points per game with 15.8, while Childress, the team’s only senior, ranks third in the conference in assists 3.7.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they have lost two of their best big men down low in forwards Ami Lakoju and Jalen Canty. Canty, a junior transfer, was supposed to be a big force on the rebounding side of things, and he was ranking first on the team, grabbing seven boards per game, but he has been ruled out indefinitely due to academics. The same goes for Lakoju, who was leading the team in field goal percentage with a solid 61.2.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m. in what could be a turnaround game for it as a squad.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>What stood as a promising yet empty-handed conclusion last season for Long Beach State, experiencing a narrow 107-102 loss to Washington in the first round of the NIT, has only added fuel to the fire and makes for a hungrier 49er squad.</p>\n<p>With nine returners possessing much experience, Head Coach Dan Monson looks to build on his team’s 20-15 record and heartbreaking 64-60 Big West Championship loss to UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>After a rigorous non-conference schedule, facing off against three of the top-10 AP ranked teams, the Beach stands at 6-12 overall and 1-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Similar to last year, the 49ers’ rough preseason schedule will likely be beneficial for them in their journey to the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>An even more jam-packed schedule this year compared to last could enable his team to get over the hump and make it to its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2012.</p>\n<p>The trio of junior forward Gabe Levin, junior guard Evan Payne, and junior guard Justin Bibbins have been the focal points for the 49ers’ offense.</p>\n<p>As two Preseason All-Conference selections this year, Bibbins and Levin have taken over the reins of former senior and scoring standout Nick Faust, combining for 22.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>Payne, a redshirt transfer from Loyola Marymount, has blossomed into his starting role starting 12 of the last 15 games for the Beach and averaging a team-high 14.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>Long Beach will face off against UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 14 at 4 p.m. The game will be aired live on ESPN3.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Will Bodendorfer</strong></p>\n<p>UC Irvine men’s basketball team and Head Coach Russell Turner, who is in his seventh year at the helm, are coming off an impressive 2016 season in which the team won a school record 28 games.</p>\n<p>The team returned just one starter from last season in senior guard Luke Nelson. Among the four starters to leave was 7’6” phenomenon center Mamadou N’Diaye whose tough defensive presence has been hard to replace.</p>\n<p>After opening the season ranked second in the Big West preseason poll, UC Irvine ended with a disappointing 5-9 non-conference record.</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start, the Anteaters have recently been able to right the ship, winning their last four games and boasting a perfect 2-0 conference record. UCI’s most recent victory came in a commanding 84-56 drudging of defending Big West Champions Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Jaron Martin has been the team’s standout player thus far, leading the team in both scoring (14.0 PPG) and assists (3.2 APG). After coming off the bench last year, Martin has solidified himself as a starter in Turner’s lineup during the 2017 campaign.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s next game will be a Big West conference matchup at UC Santa Barbara tonight, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to conference play, CSUN was at a subpar 4-9 by the end of its non-conference schedule. However, the Matadors now stand at 6-9 after their 2-0 start to Big West play as they are in a three-team tie for first place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Led by Head Coach Reggie Theus, the former NBA All-Star, and NCAA All-American is now in his fourth year at the head position. He and the Matadors will look to continue their winning ways as the regular season progresses.</p>\n<p>Northridge is powered by four Matadors who rank as some of the top individual offensive leaders in the conference.</p>\n<p>Ranking third in points per game in the Big West (15.5) is redshirt junior guard Kendall Smith. Complementing Smith is junior forward Tavrion Dawson. The Matadors’ big man ranks fourth in field goal percentage, boasting an impressive 56.8 percentage.</p>\n<p>Lastly, two Matadors top the three-point percentage rankings. At first place is junior guard Michael Warren with a 51.9 percentage. Meanwhile, redshirt junior guard Darin Johnson barely trails at a 50.0 percentage. Both sit comfortably as the only two Big West athletes that average a 50 or above percentage.</p>\n<p>It is evident that the experienced juniors are leading this team through their current streak. It will depend on their aptitude and willingness to get their younger teammates involved in order for the basketball program to continue thriving as it has been throughout the early stages of conference play.</p>\n<p>CSUN will be away from home once again this week, as it will look to extend its streak against Long Beach State this Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Tommy Pardini</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis men’s basketball team came away from its nonconference schedule with the most wins in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Ending nonconference play with at 8-7, the Aggies’ record includes an undefeated 5-0 record at home. UC Davis also ranks third in the conference in RPI – a stat that measures a team’s strength of schedule and how they perform against that schedule.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are an experienced bunch-backed by standout junior forward Chima Moneke and senior guard Brynton Lemar, who are both top 10 in points per game among Big West players, each averaging 14 per contest. Moneke ranks first in both double-doubles and rebounds per game among Big West players.</p>\n<p>The last time the Aggies had a winning record going into conference play, they won the Big West regular-season title in 2015. The preseason media poll had the Aggies finishing in fifth place in the conference, but based on their performance thus far, they look like they are ready to possibly prove the polls wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – DJ Ruvalcava</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Fullerton men’s basketball team posted a 7 – 8 record in non-conference play and currently has a 1-1 record in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Tre’ Coggins is averaging a Big West-leading 18.6 points per game and is accounting for almost 25 percent of the team’s offense. The Titans are relying on him and his supporting cast to propel them through the rest of their tough Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>With four seniors, four juniors and a large freshman class consisting of seven first-year players, the Titans are relying heavily on their mixture of youth and experience this conference season.</p>\n<p>By having preseason all-conference guards Coggins and sophomore guard Khalil Ahmad, the Titans look to finish conference play with a much better record than their dismal 2015-16 season in which they went 3-13 in conference and underperformed expectations.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Dedrique Taylor and his team hope to improve on a recent surge, during which they won three out of their last four games before eventually falling to Cal State Northridge Saturday in a close finish of 70-65.</p>\n<p>Despite their 7 -8- record, the Titans are hopeful of their chances in conference play as they boast a 7-2 home record with eight of their last 14 games being played in Titan Gym.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton looks to build on their recent success against Cal Poly at Mott Athletics Center this Thursday, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>UC Riverside dropped eight of its final nine games to end the 2015-16 season, and the Highlanders appear to have been unable to overcome their slump in the 2016-17 campaign, where they now stand at 2-11 overall and 0-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCR began its season with two wins in four games by a combined 82 points, suggesting that a bright future was on the horizon for the belabored squad. Instead, the Highlanders have now lost nine of 10 and sit at the bottom of the Big West standings as one of four teams without a conference win.</p>\n<p>Forced to rely heavily on its young talent with just three seniors on its roster, Riverside’s trio of senior forward Secean Johnson, redshirt junior guard Chance Murray, and senior guard Gentrey Thomas has been the biggest positive.</p>\n<p>The three combine for 32.3 points per game, with each individual averaging double-digit points per contest, while also being the Highlanders’ three most prolific rebounders.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have been woefully bad on the road this season, going winless in nine games. With four of the next six games at home, however, there is hope UC Riverside will be able to end its drought and mount a competitive comeback in the conference season.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Despite winning both the Big West regular season title and the Big West Conference Tournament crown just last year, the Hawaii men’s basketball team is expected to finish in eighth place in the Big West this season in the annual media preseason poll due to the loss of four perennial starters.</p>\n<p>Last year was a big year for the Rainbow Warriors, finishing the year 28-6 overall. However, part of the reason for the lack of excitement surrounding this years’ team is due to the fact that even their one returning starter, senior forward Mike Thomas, is redshirting this year after having to undergo wrist surgery this offseason.</p>\n<p>Because of Thomas’s absence, Hawaii is only returning a total production of just 66 points, 41 rebounds and 22 assists from last year’s team and has been a huge factor in the team being only 6-9 overall and 0-2 in the Big West to this point.</p>\n<p>While this year might turn out to be a wash, the Rainbow Warriors still have a bright future after adding five high school recruits and four CC transfers this offseason. In fact, junior transfer forward Gibson Johnson has already made an impact for Hawaii this season, averaging 10.8 points per game, a team-high and 4.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii will most likely not be able to defend both its regular season and conference tournament crown from a year ago, the pieces are in place to make a much more successful run in the 2017-18 season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s men’s basketball team began the season on the right foot, establishing itself as a well-organized unit heading into Big West play. However, the Mustangs have struggled through the toughest part of their schedule and sit at 5-10 overall and 0-1 in the Big West after a close loss in their first conference matchup at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Losses to key players at a crucial time in the season seem to be, unfortunately, following one after another due to injuries and transfers. True sophomore guard Jaylen Shead — who recently decided to leave Poly at the end of the fall quarter — the team’s assist leader with 5.2 per game, is going to be a hard loss to deal with as league play continues. Shead started all nine games he played before transferring, and the promising guard is yet to declare his next school after leading the Big West in helpers.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/JaylenShead/status/811288013225558019</p>\n<p>Junior forward Josh Martin, who was second for the ’Stangs with 10.4 points per game — behind redshirt senior guard Kyle Toth who leads the squad with 11.4 PPG — has experienced the biggest loss since his injury five games into the new season. Still, he has been at work on the boards with 8.4 RPG, nearly double the second-highest on the team.</p>\n<p>In the annual Big West media preseason poll, Cal Poly was projected to finish in last place in the conference standings at seasons end, and due to some unfortunate setbacks, the projection will most likely come to fruition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Part of the reason for Santa Barbara’s early woes is the fact that they have faced some very tough opponents. In fact, UCSB’s non-conference strength of schedule ranks 20<sup>th</sup> in the nation according to ESPN’s latest poll, the highest of any Big West team, with fellow conference counterpart Long Beach State sitting only five slots behind at 25 and sits at 5-11 after non-conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite having a clearly better overall record coming into this match-up, the Aggies NCSS (non-conference strength of schedule) ranked 301<sup>st</sup> of the 347 teams eligible in Division I college basketball.</p>\n<p>All-time, the Gauchos have owned the match-up between these two teams dating back to 1939 winning 28 of the 34 games played. Last season, UCSB defeated UC Davis three times during its nine-game winning streak including a regular season sweep and defeating them once more in the first round of the Big West Tournament 87-61.</p>\n<p>In order to repeat such dominance against a formidable opponent, Santa Barbara will need to rely heavily on the presence of point guard Eric Childress and shooting guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>Being the only senior on the team, Childress will certainly need to lead the example now that conference play has arrived. He currently ranks first on the team in three-point shooting percentage (37.5) assists (3.8) and steals (1.4) while averaging the second most minutes of anyone on the team (32.6).</p>\n<p>As a sophomore last season, Vincent averaged 18 points per game in three match-ups against the Aggies, shooting 45 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range. His worst performance, however, came at UC Davis where he only scored 13 points on 3-11 shooting and missed all four of his three-point attempts.</p>\n<p>Coming into this match, the junior is averaging 16.2 points per game, the highest on the team, but his shooting percentage only ranks ninth highest among his squad.</p>\n<p>As a team, one of the biggest things the Gauchos will need to change is their three-point shooting. Despite Childress and Vincent each shooting above 30 percent, the team ranks 336 out of 347 in the nation in three-point percentage at 28.7. In their two wins this season, UCSB shot a combined 40 percent from three-point range, indicating that when the three-ball is rolling, so it the team.</p>\n<p>Wanting to avenge the three losses from last season, the Aggies will look to rely on senior Brynton Lemar. The guard is second on the team in points per game (14.2) and put up some of his best performances last season against the Gauchos including his first career double-double last year at the Thunderdome with a 16 point and 11 rebound — another career high — performance.</p>\n<p>Another big name to watch out for is forward Chima Moneke who was awarded Big West Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career after averaging 17 points and 12 rebounds last week in two winning efforts. The junior transfer ranks first on the team in points (14.9) and rebounds (8.3).</p>\n<p>The new year brings about new hopes in fans that UCSB can turn around this season and make the most of it despite missing forwards Jalen Canty and Ami Lakoju after being ruled ineligible to play due to academic reasons. Having not won a Big West regular season title since 2009, it certainly would be a treat to win it this year with such a young team and after such a slow start.</p>\n<p>UCSB tips off conference play against UC Davis at The Pavillion on Wednesday, January 4<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Gauchos shot a solid 46 percent from the field and a season-high 45 percent from beyond the arc in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the first-half charge was junior guard Gabe Vincent who had 17 points in the first half, thanks to 6-11 shooting from the field including 5-10 from three-point range. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 17 points marked the sixth time this season Vincent was in double figures by the end of the first half and his highest point total since scoring 20 in the first half against the University of San Diego.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior point guard Eric Childress also took on a big load scoring the first eight points for UCSB to help take the early lead. He would finish the night with 10 points, four assists, and six rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contributions off the bench were also a big factor in the Gauchos 47-point first half outburst as freshman guards Clifton Powell and Max Heidegger had seven and eight points, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In what could’ve been one of the turning points of the game had UCSB not lost, Powell scored five straight points, off of two sweet dishes from Vincent, in the final minute to help the Gauchos take a 47-33 lead into the break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For most of the second half, the Gauchos seemed to be in complete control of the game. Although Seattle had cut it to eight with 15:53 left after a 12-6 run to kick off the final frame, Santa Barbara responded with 16-4 run over the next six minutes to take a commanding 69-49 lead with 9:37 left to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final 9:37 proceeded to be a painful experience for those who had hope that Gaucho basketball was finally turning the corner this year as they were outscored 31-7 in the final 9:37. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all started with a convincing 14-0 run by Seattle University that brought them within six with 4:52 left. Sophomore guard Zack Moore was huge knocking down two three balls while senior </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forward </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">William Powell came up with four huge rebounds and knocked in two big free throws during that 14-0 run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Seattle cut the lead back down to single digits and had hope, it was redshirt senior guard Brendan Westendorf who broke the heart of all UCSB fans in the building scoring 13 straight points, including knocking down three consecutive three-point shots to give his team a 72-71 advantage with 2:04 left.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After taking the lead the Redhawks never looked back, finishing off the Gauchos with a clutch free throw shooting down the stretch and winning the game 80-76. Westendorf finished with 28 points on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing pains are expected with this young Santa Barbara team, who is now even more limited after the losses of Ami Lakoju and Jalen Canty, but this one was especially painful. After shooting 9-20 from three in the first half, the Gauchos shot an abysmal 3-17 from deep in the second half, dooming what once seemed an easy victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was also a tough finish for Vincent who scored no points in the second half and went 0-5 from three. In fact, it was a tough final half for every Gaucho as no player had double figures in the second half. Heidegger led the team with nine second half points but shot a below average 3-10 from the field in doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could only hope that with the new year approaching and conference play starting next week, the under-manned, young UCSB squad will tap into its full potential as it did last year, getting hot at just the right time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos next game will be at UC Davis in the Big West opener on Wednesday, Jan. 4 at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi comes in at 4-5 as it is on a current two game slump. Able to recently overcome a nine game losing streak is North Dakota State as it sits at 2-9.</p>\n<p>Providing the most consistency has been the Gauchos’ backcourt duo of senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Although not widely known for their scoring abilities, with Jemerigbe and Toler averaging 8.4 and 6.9 points per game, respectively, the two have efficiently distributed the ball to create scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe’s total of 39 assists is tied for first in the Big West, while Toler’s 35 dimes ranks fourth in the conference. Both also rank in the top 10 of the conference in assists per game with Jemerigbe in second with an average of 3.9 and Toler in fifth at a 3.5 average.</p>\n<p>Most recently, it was Toler that emerged to get UCSB over its losing woes with the game-winning jumpshot in the team’s victory over Fresno State on Friday. She has been a pivotal asset in the Gauchos’ bench rotation as her PPG average leads all second unit players.</p>\n<p>Coming off its season-high three-point percentage of 50 percent in its win, it is likely UCSB will attempt to maintain its hot hand from long distance. On average, the Gauchos make 7.1 three-pointers per game and are just two three-pointers short of being tied with UC Davis for second place in total three-pointers made this season with a current mark of 71.</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara’s three-point attack is redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter. She possesses a team-high total of 25 made three-pointers and is third in the conference in three-point percentage at 43.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB has successfully defended the perimeter as well. The Gauchos lead the Big West in opponent three-point percentage, holding teams to a 25.9 average.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos may meet their match Monday afternoon facing Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi as the Islanders’ defense is one of the best of their conference.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi ranks third in the Southland Conference in scoring defense, allowing 61.1 PPG. Most notably, the Islanders hold a conference-leading 29.6 opponent three-point percentage. They rank second in opponent field goal percentage too, restricting past teams to a 37.9 average.</p>\n<p>A pair of wins could send Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi into Southland Conference play with a winning record for just the third time in program history.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos will face more of a defensive battle in playing the Islanders, they will hope to contain North Dakota State’s junior guard Taylor Thunstedt.</p>\n<p>Thunstedt leads the Bison in scoring with 16 PPG which ranks third in the Summit League. She also leads the league in total made three-pointers with 42 and is fourth in points scored with 176 this season.</p>\n<p>Another concern for UCSB will be dealing with the size of senior forward Emily Spier. She’s behind Thunstedt in scoring with an average of 10. 3 points per game, but is the team’s leading rebounder, collecting eight per game, ranking third in the Summit League.</p>\n<p>Adding to the Bison’s presence on the boards is senior forward Brianna Jones.

The Tar Heels won the match 84-67.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and UCLA will meet for the 20<sup>th</sup> time on Wednesday, with the Gauchos only having won one game against the Bruins which was back in 2003 in a one-point victory.</p>\n<p>If UCSB has any hope of pulling off quite possibly the biggest upset in program history, then priority number one would be to stop the Bruins freshman point guard Lonzo Ball.</p>\n<p>Ball has become a household name across the country within UCLA’s ten-game winning streak due mostly to his proficient passing ability. The Chino Hills, CA native is second in the NCAA in assists averaging 8.8 per game and has already notched four double-double performances.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 30<sup>th</sup> against UCR, a fellow Big West opponent, Ball dished out 13 assists, breaking the record for UCLA’s single-game freshman assists record. Ball also averages 15 points per game, fourth best on the team, and is shooting a great 56 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Fellow freshman forward T.J. Leaf has also been nothing short of spectacular. The California native has averaged 17.6 points per game, second-best on the team, and 9.6 rebounds per game, best on the squad.</p>\n<p>Senior guards Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton have also played spectacular with Hamilton leading the team in scoring with 17.7 points per game, and Alford scoring double figures in nine of the Bruins’ ten games this season.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Bruins have looked unstoppable offensively in most games they have played this season scoring at least 90 points in seven of its 10 games this season.</p>\n<p>As of December 10<sup>th</sup>, UCLA ranked first in the nation in assists per game (23.9), field goal percentage (56.2) and three-point field goal percentage (47.1). The Bruins also average 97.5 points per game, second-best in the country.</p>\n<p>Certainly, taking on this hot team at the Pauley Pavilion will be a tough challenge, but something most Gauchos is up to. UCSB is led by juniors Gabe Vincent and Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Both players had excellent games on Sunday against the Toreros, with Vincent scoring 20 points in the first half on 8-11 shooting. The guard would finish with a game-high 23 points on the night. Vincent averages a team-high 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Canty had a less than stellar first half scoring no points and only pulling down one rebound. The forward turned it around in the second half scoring 14 points shooting a perfect 6-6 from the field and pulling down three rebounds before fouling out.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to look to those two early and often if they want to come out with a win and will also need hearty performances from senior guard Eric Childress who leads the team in assists with 4.3 per game and has knocked down at least one three ball in six of the teams’ seven games.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night will not be an easy one for this struggling Santa Barbara squad. However, a solid performance on the road against such a quality opponent could be the thing the Gauchos need. Whether or not there will be an upset alert tonight, fans should expect a tough performance from a Gaucho team that, although has only one win, has played hard in every game.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against the No. 2 UCLA at 7:30 p.m. at the Pauley Pavilion on Wednesday, December 14 with the game being available to watch on the PAC-12 network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Indeed, a Cheyanne Wallace offensive rebound with 22 seconds left in the game turned into two made free throws for sophomore forward Wallace, which gave LMU a lead that it never again surrendered. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One contributing factor to the Lions’ high offensive rebound count was that the Gauchos played excellent defense in that fourth quarter. LMU shot only 26.7 percent from the field in the fourth, which of course created lots of opportunities for offensive rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB, on the other hand, shot a respectable 46.2 percent in the fourth quarter Friday night, but were unable to come up with a single offensive rebound. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortcomings on the glass, plus the Gauchos’ 0-0 night at the free throw line, was what made the difference in the fourth quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite 11 personal fouls, LMU managed to play efficient defense in preventing the Gauchos from reaching the bonus and getting to the free throw line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up 55-54 with only 32 seconds left, the Gauchos were in a position to make their struggles on the boards and in getting to the line irrelevant. All they had to do was hold onto the ball and milk the clock, and the Lions would have practically no time left to score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With several fouls to give, however, LMU was in a position to make milking the clock difficult for UCSB. Junior Lion guard Makenzie Cast did just that, fouling UCSB senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and coming up with a steal in quick succession. Wallace knocked down two free throws a few seconds later, and suddenly LMU had all the control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB sophomore guard Coco Miller played all but two minutes of Friday’s game and put up a truly utilitarian stat line of nine points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. Redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter and Jemerigbe led the Gauchos with 15 points each. Those were a particularly efficient 15 points for Jemerigbe, who played 24 minutes off the bench and went 7-8 from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up for UCSB is the last game of their four-game road trip. The Gauchos will take on San Diego State in San Diego on Sunday, Dec. 11 at 2 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74545\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74545\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/","id":317,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[316,315,314],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Takes a Knee for Social Justice","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"More than half of the players on the UCSB women’s basketball team have taken to kneeling during the national anthem procession beginning at the team’s exhibition game versus Cal State Los Angeles ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74533\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74533\" data-attachment-id=\"74533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-01/womens-basketball-takes-a-knee/11-30-womensbball-scu-ericswensonnexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?fit=3771%2C2121&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3771,2121\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"11-30-womensbball-scu-ericswensonnexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74533\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus-1024x576.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"Many of the Gauchos women's Basketball team take a knee during the national anthem.

Santa Clara dominated the Gauchos in both games, defeating UCSB by an average of 14.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Four of five starters returned for Santa Clara this season as the familiarity has been helpful with three Broncos currently averaged double-figures in scoring with roughly 12 PPG.</p>\n<p>Within this group of three are two of the team’s returning starters in senior forward Marie Bertholdt and junior forward Morgan McGwire. It was McGwire, who led the Broncos in each matchup, scoring with 13 points apiece.</p>\n<p>After redshirting last season, completing the trio of scorers, the newest addition to the lineup   is redshirt sophomore guard Emily Wolph. She is the Broncos’ markswoman from long range as she makes and attempts the most three-pointers per game on the team at 2.2 makes and 5.6 attempts, respectively. She is second on the team behind McGwire in three-point percentage at 39.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Still, the Broncos’ size is what poses the most difficult challenge for UCSB’s defense.</p>\n<p>In the first game, the Broncos managed to outrebound UCSB 45-31 in addition to outscoring them in points in the paint 28-14 and second chance points 24-7. Following this game just two weeks later, Santa Clara continued its dominance shooting 45. 1 percent from the field while outscoring UCSB in the paint 32-18.</p>\n<p>Given the Broncos’ ability to control the interior, it is obvious that the Gauchos will look to have a stern defensive presence in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to handle their size,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’re still small on the perimeter. I thought their size bothered us last year not just inside, [but also] on the perimeter [just as much]. If we’re not going to be as big, we have to be able to play fast.”</p>\n<p>While playing with at a fast pace may be most beneficial for UCSB, the Gauchos will hope to sustain their momentum from last game after tallying season-highs in field goal percentage at 46.2 percent from the field and 41.2 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s cold shooting in last season’s two games did not help their attempt to contain the Broncos’ size as UCSB shot below 30 percent from the field and beyond the three-point line in each game.</p>\n<p>Giving the Gauchos a better chance to compete against the Broncos’ inside presence is redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman. She enters Wednesday’s game leading the Big West in field goal percentage shooting 62.8 percent from the field and is one of two Gauchos, alongside sophomore guard Coco Miller, to average double-digit PPG at 12.2.</p>\n<p>At the brink of becoming another Gaucho to average double-figures in scoring is redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter. She averages 9.4 PPG and is third in the conference in total three-pointers made with 11. Porter’s 42.3 three-point average also ranks eighth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Put in the team’s starting lineup two games ago, Porter is still adjusting to her role after beginning the season on the bench as she emerges as one of the Gauchos’ top scorers.</p>\n<p>Yet, in order for UCSB to establish consistency on the offensive end, it must be efficient with possession of the ball. In its last matchup against the Broncos, UCSB had a season-high 31 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Despite being able to force Santa Clara to turn the ball over in the two games with 29 and 24 turnovers, respectively, UCSB was still outscored by the Broncos in points off turnovers each time.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get to a [point in which] we take more pride in our half court defense,” Henrickson said. “We have to be more disruptive. Even the little [guards] can be disruptive. We have to be able to get out and play fast in transition, try to take advantage of our speed. But to do that you’ve got to be able to get a stop.”</p>\n<p>With Edelman in the paint, it is plausible that the Gauchos’ ability to disrupt the Broncos increases as UCSB’s frontcourt has the ability to compete on the boards, which will help put the team’s up-tempo plan in motion.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s matchup between UCSB and Santa Clara will tip-off at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74522\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74522\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/","id":315,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[314,313,312],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":18,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
