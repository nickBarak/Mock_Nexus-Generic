More recently, Los Angeles won three-straight titles in 2000-02 behind one of the best duos in NBA history in Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Bulls have also known the glory of the three-peat twice, accomplishing it in 1991-93 and 1996-98. Chicago, of course, was led by arguably the best player to ever play the game of basketball, Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>The team standing above all however, is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics utterly dominated the basketball world in the sixties, winning eight championships in a row and 11 in 13 years from 1957-69. The master behind the success? A 6’10’’ center by the name of Bill Russell.</p>\n<p>Russell, who is underrated when it comes to listing the best players of all time, holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls, the Heat features one of the best players to ever grace a basketball court and certainly the best player currently playing the game right now: LeBron James. Miami also features the “Big Three” in James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, which has captivated audiences all over the world.</p>\n<p>The Heat’s fast-paced, flashy play and incredible talent make them one of the most entertaining teams of all time if nothing else. They also play at a time where the level of competition around the league is much higher (excluding the Eastern Conference this season).</p>\n<p>Every year now, there are a handful of teams fighting for the NBA Championship rather than just a couple teams that were powerhouses decades ago. It does make the idea of a three-peat seem even more remarkable.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when it all comes down to it, it’s all about the rings. Boston leads the NBA in championships with an incredible 17 titles. The Lakers don’t rank far behind with 16.</p>\n<p>Considering that a sports dynasty is defined as “a team that dominates its sport or league for an extraordinary length of time,” these are the two teams that should be considered dynasties.</p>\n<p>They’re always in the hunt and rarely have off years. They’re the teams everyone wants to be a part of because there’s always a good chance to make history.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Lakers and Celtics are the best teams in NBA history. Period.</p>\n<p>With that said, Chicago would have to come next on the list for ranking of the best team with six crowns, all coming in the electrifying era that was Jordan.</p>\n<p>The Jordan Era made Chicago a destination for great players and a city that desired greatness in the basketball world. Nevertheless, the Bulls are still looking for that next group to bring home more rings and give the Bulls multiple eras of greatness.</p>\n<p>As for Miami, which currently owns three championships, another title would bring the Heat’s total to four, tying it for fourth-most crowns in NBA history with San Antonio.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Miami will go down as one of the most elite franchises in the NBA if it can three-peat in June, but four franchise championships is a long way off from 17, 16 or even six crowns.<br>\nAnd considering that the number of championships determines your worth, the Heat still have a long way to go if it wants to move up in the ranking for best team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/","id":526,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[525,524,523],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Add Depth With Three Recruits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensBasketballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensBasketballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=962%2C641&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team aims at taking the Big West next season with a trio of new recruits.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team finished this past season with an impressive second-place finish in the Big West Conference and the reigning conference Player of the Year in rising junior center Alan Williams.

Last season at Mt. San Jacinto, Smith led his team to the quarterfinals of the California Community College State Tournament while averaging 14 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“My staff had watched him play and we just decided that we wanted to add a little bit more depth at the guard position,” Coach Williams said. “I’m very excited to add more physical, quick, aggressive, pressure type defenders to a team that I do believe is going to have the ability to be very good defensively.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the team’s depth at guard is 6’2” combo guard Gabe Vincent out of Stockton, CA. Vincent attended St. Mary’s High School and played at the highest level of AAU basketball in the state for the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very well-rounded complete guard that doesn’t really have a weakness, particularly out of high school,” Coach Williams said. “He does everything well. He’s a very good defender, very good rebounder, very good shooter and passer. He really has an extremely well balanced game.”</p>\n<p>Vincent is expected to contribute right away as a shooting guard, but has the skill set to play both the point guard and shooting guard positions.</p>\n<p>“Vincent and Smith will play right away. They’re both very ready physically to contribute. They’re strong, they’re tough, they defend,” Coach Williams said. “They’re not going to be intimidated, neither one of them, and they’re both going to be really good additions.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class is Justin Burks, a 6’6” forward out of Nevada. Burks attended Las Vegas’ Arbor View High School and also played at the highest level of AAU basketball for the Las Vegas Prospects.</p>\n<p>“He adds to the John Green-Michael Bryson type category. He’s versatile, longer, taller,” Coach Williams said. “He’s going to have to get a lot more physical and stronger but his upside is very good.”</p>\n<p>While Burks figures to need more time to adjust to the college game in comparison to Vincent and Smith, he adds versatility and the ability to play and defend the two, three and four positions on the floor.</p>\n<p>“He has a really good mid-range game, and he’s really good off the dribble getting into the paint,” Coach Williams said. “He’s pretty active chasing rebounds. Those things add a lot to us.”</p>\n<p>The three newcomers join a talented and veteran group of players headlined by Williams. Big Al led the Big West in points and rebounds per game, while ranking 12th in the nation in scoring and second nationally in rebounding.</p>\n<p>“Most everybody that’s coming here is excited playing with a guy of Al’s caliber,” Coach Williams said. We think it’s a great thing that we’re adding the pieces to play around a great player.”</p>\n<p>Rising junior guard Michael Bryson played second fiddle to Big Al last season, finishing second on the team in scoring while garnering Big West Honorable Mention. Bryson figures to start at either the shooting guard or small forward position next season.</p>\n<p>Point guard play looks to be a source of strength for the Gauchos next season, thanks in large part to rising senior Zalmico Harmon. Harmon finished last season with the second best assist-to-turnover ratio in the entire nation and finished the year with Big West Honorable Mention accolades.</p>\n<p>“We’re hopeful that Z makes as big as a jump between his junior and senior year as he did during his junior year,” Coach Williams said. “We thought he got way better as the year went on. We feel like he has a whole other level he can go to as his comfort zone in the program rises.”</p>\n<p>Also playing point will be sophomore Eric Childress and junior T.J. Taylor. Childress finished his freshman year with spectacular consistency towards the end of the season, while Taylor is a two-year starter who missed last season with a hip injury.</p>\n<p>Smith will certainly compete for point guard playing time with the trio and Vincent could even work his way into the conversation by the end of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that [Smith] would play that position over them, he’d play with them, which allows you to have two point guards on the floor like I did with Eric and Z,” Coach Williams said. “Now we’ll have five guys in the program that are very good with the ball and very good off the bounce.”</p>\n<p>The rest of UCSB’s rotation will consist of rising junior forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler, redshirt freshman forward Alex Hart and junior guard John Green. Brewe started much of the year at power forward for the Gauchos last season while Beeler provided solid backup minutes at both the four and five spots.</p>\n<p>Hart redshirted last season but brings a versatile ability to shoot the ball from outside in addition to his 6’10” frame. Green has lost most of his career to injury but has the potential to add another deadly scorer and physical presence to UCSB if he can stay healthy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 20, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55443\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55443\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/","id":527,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[526,525,524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The NBA Hits a Home Run and Bans Donald Sterling","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Donald Sterling received a lifetime ban from the NBA for his racist comments caught on audio.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Donald Sterling saga has developed into one of the most stunning and baffling stories in the world of sports in the last several years.</p>\n<p>Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was caught on audio recording telling his girlfriend, Vanessa Stiviano, that he did not want her posting photos of black people on Instagram or bringing black people to Clipper games.

Essentially, Sterling is stripped of all power but remains owner, is responsible for signing checks and fronting money and is still able to make money off the Clippers.</p>\n<p>The next move for the NBA is to remove the title of ownership from Sterling, a move that is possible only if three-quarters or more of NBA owners approve the vote. There is no doubt that owners will approve this, as any vote to keep Sterling as an owner of the NBA will be a black eye for the NBA and the owner of whichever franchise votes to keep him.</p>\n<p>Silver and the league office hit a grand slam with the decision to ban Sterling for life given the circumstances of Sterling’s comments and his previous racist actions. Social media exploded following Tuesday morning’s announcement as journalists, owners and players, current and former alike, all praised Silver’s decision to hand out the maximum punishment allowed to Sterling.</p>\n<p>Sterling deserves all backlash and punishment that comes his way following these remarks. However, his previous actions also call into question why he was allowed to continue as owner of the Clippers.</p>\n<p>Previously, Sterling was accused of discriminating against families with children, and Black and Latino tenants in apartment buildings he owns. A settlement was agreed upon and Sterling never admitted to guilt, but there have been several instances where his racial viewpoints have been called into question.</p>\n<p>It was not until the NBA’s hand was pushed by the audio recording that the league chose to take action against Sterling. It is a shame that he was allowed to stay for so long in a league so renowned for its progressiveness in social matters such as this.</p>\n<p>One reason that Silver’s decision is so justified is it takes pressure off Clippers fans, players and personnel to abandon ship during an important playoff run. Many were calling for those associated with the organization to boycott, calling into question their morals for non-action.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think it is unfair for people to blame players for wanting to continue to play and asking them to forfeit an entire season of hard work in response to an owner’s actions. The players play for each other and the fans, not for the sake of the owner’s happiness. Likewise, fans no longer have to battle whether to continue supporting the team and attend games or boycott and leave the players with empty stands during this critical playoff series.</p>\n<p>This is certainly an important day for the NBA and especially for the Clippers organization. There is no room for this type of behavior or these thoughts in sports and the NBA made the right decision to get rid of Donald Sterling. Good riddance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears on page 10 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/","id":535,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[534,533,532],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pass the Torch","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Womens-Basketball-10-2-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Womens-Basketball-10-2-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a Great Freshman Season, UCSB Looks to Onome Jemerigbe to be the Team’s Floor General","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Four seconds remained on the game clock.

For Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, however, it metaphorically meant something more, something positive for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On a team dominated by seniors, it showed the reins of the team being passed to Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>“I kind of liked at the end of the year meeting [talking to her about how] even though we didn’t call the last play to have the ball in her hands in our last game against Davis, she wanted it,” Mitchell said. “That tells me a lot about her drive, and it’s only going to fuel her to work harder.”</p>\n<p>Named to the Big West All-Freshman team, Jemerigbe played well beyond her years this season. She quickly became a staple in Santa Barbara’s starting lineup, playing the most minutes behind the three seniors.</p>\n<p>In fact, after starting 26 of UCSB’s 30 games, Jemerigbe became the first freshman to start more than 20 games since La Shay Fears in 2005-06 and just the fourth in the past 14 years, joining elite company in Kristen Mann and Mia Fischer, as well as Fears.</p>\n<p>“I remember when we told her we were going to start her. I go, ‘Are you nervous?’ And I can remember her looking at me and she was like, ‘Yeah. I’m really nervous.’” Mitchell said. “But she never looked back after that. She’s so competitive, she wants to win and she knows how to win.”</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe made her biggest impact on the defensive end. Although listed at just 5’5’’, Jemerigbe used her speed and quickness to hassle opponents on all 4,700 square feet of the court, ranking second on the team in steals at 1.1 per game.</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, Jemerigbe gave the Gauchos something it hasn’t seen in many years: a true point guard. With her pass first, shoot second mentality, Jemerigbe registered 67 assists this season, which ranks eighth all-time amongst UCSB freshmen.</p>\n<p>“She exceeded what I knew she had ability-wise,” Mitchell said. “We knew the natural God-given ability, but her understanding of the game and competitive spirit were far greater than I anticipated. I think she had an outstanding freshman year.”</p>\n<p>While Jemerigbe’s ability to adapt to college basketball could easily be attributed to her time at UCSB, Mitchell acknowledged other sources for the freshman’s transition, including one much closer to home.</p>\n<p>The Stockton, California native is the youngest of four children, all of whom are involved in sports. One family member in particular has made the biggest influence on Jemerigbe, her older sister Afure.</p>\n<p>“[Afure] knows the whole DI, student-athlete life, so she’s my biggest role model,” Jemerigbe said. “She gives me so much advice. It’s cool having somebody older who’s already been through it and can guide me through it. Even though she’s not here, I can still talk to her over the phone and text. She’s always giving me advice and encouraging me.”</p>\n<p>Afure Jemerigbe is currently a senior at Berkeley and a star on Cal’s women’s basketball team. Playing a shooting guard, Afure started all 32 games for the Golden Bears, serving as one of the team’s biggest three-point threats. She averaged 12.1 points per game this season.</p>\n<p>“[Onome’s] one of those that watches and evaluates. I think she was able to watch Afure,” Mitchell said. “I think any time you have an example of older siblings or family members that have been successful at the college level and you’ve seen their ups and downs and what they had to go through, it gave her a head start on the mindset she needed to play at this level.”</p>\n<p>With a three-year age difference, the Jemerigbe sisters played together at St. Mary’s High School in the 2009-10 season, which only aided the young Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>“It was so much fun,” Jemerigbe said. “She’s like my best friend, so it was no drama; it was all fun. She would encourage me when I got on the court and tell me what I needed to work on.”</p>\n<p>Now, Jemerigbe will try to take a page out of her older sister’s book on the offensive end. Seniors Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason accounted for 64.3 percent of the Gauchos’ scoring this season.</p>\n<p>As a natural distributor, Jemerigbe averaged just 5.8 points this year, although she proved she could produce at the rim for herself too, scoring in double figures in five games. In the next few years, Mitchell will ask for more.</p>\n<p>“Nic, Mel and Destini aren’t going to be there next year, so I have to pick it up a lot more that they’re gone,” Jemerigbe said. “I need to be more of a leader. That’s what we lack the most right now since they were our leading scorers.”</p>\n<p>And with all three seniors playing the guard position, Jemerigbe will also become the guard with the most experience and be asked to lead her team. Even as a freshman, Jemerigbe showed she could lead by example, but now, her team will look for its point guard to be the floor general.</p>\n<p>“With a year under her belt, I think she had already led by example in her work ethic and competitive spirit, but now she’ll add that element of being a little more vocal,” Mitchell said. “She’s a starter and an all-freshman team player and she earned that right by working hard every day. Being a starter, she knows the expectations and the returners will hopefully follow her lead and continue to get better every day. As long as O continues to work, we’ll keep the ball in her hands.”</p>\n<p>So next year, don’t be surprised if Mitchell designs the last-second play for Jemerigbe. Her point guard will be ready.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54724\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54724\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/","id":522,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[521,520,519],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops One-Point Thriller to UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos' season comes to an end after a 58-57 loss to the Aggies","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In a one-point decision, it’s easy to point fingers at all the different factors that could have changed the outcome.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to blame UCSB’s poor shooting in the first half as it shot a dismal 28 percent from the field, resulting in a 17-point halftime deficit.</p>\n<p>It would be even easier to shoulder the guilt on Head Coach Carlene Mitchell for picking up her first technical foul of her career with 65 seconds to go in the game.

Despite an incredible second-half comeback, the fact of the matter remains that the UCSB women’s basketball team lost 58-57 to UC Davis in the first round of the Big West Tournament tonight and its season is done.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of this team,” Mitchell said. “That was not an 8-22 team that just ended those last 20 minutes.”</p>\n<p>All season long, the thorn in Santa Barbara’s side has been consistency. 20 minutes of solid basketball isn’t enough and it came back to bite the eighth-seed Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After starting the game 3-7 from the field, UCSB began settling for too many jumpers against the Aggies’ zone defense. With the score tied at nine, Davis went on a 12-0 run, which was extended to 19 points with less than a minute to go before halftime. After its solid start, Santa Barbara shot just 5-23 the rest of the half.</p>\n<p>“100 percent [it was a matter of settling for too many jumpers],” Mitchell said. “I think once one or two didn’t fall, they continued to show that we could get in a flow with the jumpers.”</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms down 35-18, the Gauchos mounted a comeback. Led by the three seniors, guards Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason, the lead was chopped to four points with 13:10 to go.</p>\n<p>“It were no x’s and o’s (at halftime),” Mitchell said. “I just told them that actions speak louder than words. You can look in people’s eyes sometimes and know whether they’re going to come back out and battle or whether they’re ready to call it quits. Not once this year have these guys ever given in.”</p>\n<p>Play on both ends of the floor was nearly flawless. While UCSB has struggled this season defensively at times, any team under Mitchell prides itself on its defense. Using its press, Santa Barbara forced the Aggies into 11 second-half turnovers, which resulted in 24 points on the other end. In total, the Gauchos held UCD to 23 points in the final 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Our focus is always defense,” Zornig said. “Coach Mitch told us not to worry about the scoring and just to focus on the defense. In the second half, we came out with so much energy. We pressed them and trapped them and caused them to force turnovers. Our defense got us back in the game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also aided by the fact that sophomore forward Alyson Doherty went down with an injury approximately midway through the second half. She was unable to return after posting 14 points.</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB tallied 39 second-half points, shooting a phenomenal 60.7 percent from the field by attacking and getting to the rim. All season long, the seniors have put the team on their backs, but they took the saying to a new level last night, totaling every single point Santa Barbara scored in the second half.</p>\n<p>Zornig led the team with 21 points on 9-15 shooting while Mason added 16 points on 8-13 shooting. Nesbit also contributed 16 points.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been talking about how it’s March Madness. It’s one and done,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, it took us until the second half to get that run going, but we knew that if we didn’t give it all we had, we’d be going home.”</p>\n<p>With just under two minutes to play, Davis’ lead had been sliced to one at 56-55 by a layup from Mason in transition.</p>\n<p>“[It] was a really exciting basketball game,” UC Davis Head Coach Jennifer Gross said. “I thought we came our tremendously in the first half with great energy, executed offensively and played some of the best defense we’ve played this year, but we knew Santa Barbara wasn’t going away. They have tremendous players. I wasn’t surprised when they got it going.”</p>\n<p>However, with 65 seconds left, Zornig was called for an offensive foul. Mitchell, a coach not known for jabbing at the referees, immediately headed toward the nearest official. She was immediately given a technical foul, which resulted in two free throws for Davis on the other end, both of which were converted.</p>\n<p>“I’m disappointed for the seniors that they had to go out this way. I’ve already apologized to them,” Mitchell said. “It’s something I can’t take back; I can’t give them another game. Would we have won? I don’t know. I think at some point, you want the players to know you have their back and I just voiced it too loud in a critical moment in the game.”</p>\n<p>Rather than trying to tie the game with a three, Nesbit attacked, making a layup to bring the game within one once again at 58-57. On the other end, Santa Barbara earned the stop it needed defensively, causing a 30 second shot clock violation on Davis, but that left UCSB with just 4.0 seconds.</p>\n<p>Needing to go the length of the court, the Gauchos found their quickest player, Jemerigbe. In the short amount of time remaining, Jemerigbe was able to get all the way to the right elbow before she was forced to throw up the runner. It bounced off the back of the iron, sending UCSB home.</p>\n<p>“They did a good job trying to deny Nic and Mel,” Mitchell said. “We were trying to get it across half court and [run] a quick play. It is what it is and it’s never the last play that wins or loses the game.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ends its season at 8-22 overall and 3-14 in Big West play. UC Davis, meanwhile, improves to 15-15 overall and will play UC Irvine in the quarterfinals tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“I can’t say enough about their players. Their seniors in particular were exceptional tonight,” Gross said. “We beat a very, very good basketball team tonight. The records don’t show a whole lot in our conference. Whether you have three or ten losses, every game is a battle.

If UC Riverside had beat Long Beach Saturday, the Gauchos’ season would be over.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Santa Barbara, it is playing in the postseason and records no longer matter.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s really excited,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “The first thing [Head Coach Carlene Mitchell] told us today when we walked into film was that we’re 0-0. Whatever happened during the regular season doesn’t matter now. We’re ready to make a run and upset teams.”</p>\n<p>Going into the Big West Tournament as the last seed makes the Gauchos the major underdogs, and that’s how they like it.</p>\n<p>The situation is reminiscent to two years ago when UCSB entered the conference tournament as the sixth seed. The team caught fire, winning the Big West Tournament and punching its ticket to the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>“The kids know we have an uphill battle, but they also saw what USC did this past week,” Mitchell said. “We’ve been a low seed before and won games to get to the NCAA (Tournament). It’s March Madness and it’s called that for a reason.”</p>\n<p>But before Santa Barbara can think too far ahead, it has to take care of the task at hand. Tonight, that’s beating UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Both teams head to Long Beach with their final games of the regular season resulting in losses. The Aggies fell to UC Irvine Saturday while the Gauchos lost to rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB played very well against the Mustangs, which will take the second seed in the Tournament. If Santa Barbara takes the intensity it had Saturday to Long Beach tomorrow, the Gauchos could upset a lot of teams.</p>\n<p>The reason UCSB came out with the loss Saturday was defensive breakdowns down the stretch. The Gauchos gave Cal Poly’s outside shooters too much space and the Mustangs took advantage. Elegado hit two in the final minutes to clinch the game, recording a career-high 32 points on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>While UCSB played a solid game Saturday, the defensive breakdowns speak to Santa Barbara’s struggles all year long. Offense is not causing losses. Unlike in years prior where scoring was tough, this year it’s the defensive lapses and lack of consistency that put the Gauchos in the bottom of the standings.</p>\n<p>“We always focus on defense,” Zornig said. “We’ve been playing a lot of zone lately, but we’re going to mix it up. We just have to play disciplined.”</p>\n<p>In their two meetings with the Aggies this year, the Gauchos failed to put together more than 20 minutes of good basketball. In the first meeting in Davis, UCSB played well in the first half, but fell apart in the second, allowing UCD to shoot 41.7 percent from three point range. In the more recent matchup, Santa Barbara didn’t come to play, going down 15-2 to start the game. Davis shot 56 percent in the first half before the Gauchos played the Aggies even in the second half.</p>\n<p>“It’s the defensive side of things (that matter),” Mitchell said. “We have to do a better job on our post defense because they went at us all night long. We may mix it up like we did with Poly and see if it helps change the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The matchup of the game tomorrow will be down low with junior center Clair Watkins versus sophomore forward Alyson Doherty. Doherty averages 13.1 points per game, shooting a league-leading 55.7 percent from the field. Against the Gauchos, she’s upped her production, averaging 19 points in the two meetings.</p>\n<p>But as of late, UCSB also has a post presence inside in Watkins. The last five games, Watkins has nearly averaged a double-double at 10 points and 9.2 rebounds. Against Cal Poly, she held last year’s Big West Player of the Year, senior center Molly Schlemer, to 13 points. Meanwhile, Watkins tallied superior numbers at 16 points and 12 rebounds. While Santa Barbara is a guard-driven team, its success depends on Watkins.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to take the momentum I got in the Cal Poly game and try to carry it into the Davis game,” Watkins said. “[Doherty] had a good game here when they played us, but I think we’re all ready. It comes down to post defense for me.”</p>\n<p>The other player UCSB will keep an eye on is junior forward Sydnee Fipps. Named an All-Big West first team member today, Fipps ranks third in the conference in scoring at 17.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB may pull a triangle-and-two defense out of its pocket. Led by Doherty and Fipps, the Aggies rank first in field goal percentage, shooting an impressive 42.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos aren’t far behind in that category, shooting 41.1 percent.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to beat a team three times,” Watkins said. “We’ve learned a lot from playing them twice. We know their go-to players, their moves and what they want to do on offense and defense, so hopefully we can learn and apply it and finally get a win against them.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. at Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We had some shining moments and some scary moments.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing arguably their best game of the year, the Gauchos drop to 3-13 in the Big West and 8-21 overall. Cal Poly, on the other hand, improves to 11-5 in conference and 17-12 overall, clinching the second seed in the Big West Tournament. The loss is the seventh straight to the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>With the regular season done, UCSB now waits on the UC Riverside game tonight at 7 p.m., which will determine if the Gauchos go to the Big West Tournament. Hosting Long Beach, the Gauchos need Riverside to lose as the Highlanders own the tiebreaker.</p>\n<p>“We’ll just pray that the basketball gods are with the Gauchos and they know we still haven’t played our best basketball yet,” Mitchell said. “There’s a game later tonight that controls our destiny and that’s unfortunate.”</p>\n<p>A back and forth game the entirety of the contest, Santa Barbara took a 58-57 lead with 7:13 remaining off a layup from senior guard Destini Mason. However, the lead would be short-lived as Cal Poly’s league-leading offense took over.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs shot just 8-24 from three-point range, Cal Poly drained three triples down the stretch, two coming from Elegado. On the game, Elegado shot 11-22 from the field, including 6-13 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“There were communication breakdowns. We tried to mix it up more than normal, so maybe our kids weren’t as comfortable,” Mitchell said. “Late in the game, [Elegado] knocked down two critical threes and pretty much sealed the game. A great player like that, you give her an inch and she’s going to knock it down. She willed her team to a win today.”</p>\n<p>While Elegado erupted on the offensive end, UCSB did a solid job on 6’5’’ star Molly Schlemer. The Gauchos held Schlemer to 13 points and 10 rebounds, compared to her 37 point, 15 rebound performance in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>In fact, junior center Clair Watkins outplayed Schlemer, tallying a double-double on a career-high 16 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly’s a big rivalry game and Schlemer had quite a few points last game,” Watkins said. “I just wanted to come out here and help my teammates and seniors and prove that UCSB can definitely hang with Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Santa Barbara actually outshot Cal Poly 43.7 percent to 39.7 percent, but was unable to get key defensive stops down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Along with Watkins, all three seniors finished in double-figures on senior day. Mason also tallied a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“It was difficult (playing on senior day),” Mason said. “It was very emotional, but I tried to look past it and be like. ‘It’s a normal game.’ But everyone comes to you and says ‘it’s your senior day,’ so you can’t ignore it. You have to embrace it.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB earns the final spot into the conference tournament, it will play next Tuesday at Long Beach State against the fifth seed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54430\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54430\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/","id":515,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[514,513,512],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Arrested Following Confrontation With Hawaii Coach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PART_1394243031794_IMG952090.jpg.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PART_1394243031794_IMG952090.jpg.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is receiving negative attention following an incident at Thursday night's men's basketball game.

Instead of the Gauchos’ victory garnering attention, UCSB is receiving national coverage for an incident of a UCSB student running onto the court and confronting Hawaii head coach Gib Arnold.</p>\n<p>With UCSB leading 30-16 with 6:02 remaining in the first half, Hawaii senior guard Brandon Spearman was assessed a technical foul for complaining to officials. Arnold then rushed to half-court to argue with referees before being restrained by a Hawaii player, receiving a technical foul in the process.</p>\n<p>That is when the student rushed onto the court, angrily confronting Arnold and yelling in the coach’s face. Hawaii players Christian Standhardinger and Garrett Nevels quickly pushed the fan away before anything else happened. The fan backpedaled to his seat, gesturing for Hawaii players to come after him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I apologized to Hawaii during the game, I apologized to Gib at halftime. He came over to me and we chatted,” UCSB head coach Bob Williams said. “I apologized to the officials, they should never have to deal with anything like that.”</p>\n<p>The student returned to his midcourt seat in student section, high-fiving friends in the vicinity. Bob Brontsema, Assistant Athletics Director of Events, Facilities and Operations immediately followed the student into the stands, calmly escorting the student out of the Thunderdome without using force. The student complied, grabbing his jacket before receiving a few high-fives as he walked out of the arena.</p>\n<p>Following his ejection, the student was arrested by campus police and spent the night in a local police holding cell before friends picked him up Friday morning. The student was wearing a navy UCSB Class of 2014 shirt, and was yelling and jumping up and down throughout the duration of the first half, obviously excited about the game.</p>\n<p>“It’s embarrassing. That’s a bad foot to be putting forward that represents all of UCSB,” Williams said. “That’s just wrong. Flat out wrong and it should never happen.”</p>\n<p>According to Bill Mahoney, Assistant Athletics Director of Communications, the student will face disciplinary action from the university following a hearing from Judicial Affairs, one of the possible actions being expulsion.</p>\n<p>Many members of the UCSB Athletics Department expressed regret at the conclusion of the game regarding the embarrassment UCSB would receive from the actions of this one student.</p>\n<p>This incident certainly placed a negative light on UCSB, with the story receiving national attention, including a headline on the front page of ESPN.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/","id":519,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[518,517,516],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Stumbles in Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos drop a 73-60 decision to the Rainbow Wahine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This season, there has been one statistic that seems to determine wins versus losses for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>In the rebounding column, the Gauchos average 39.9 rebounds in victories compared to 32.0 boards in defeats.</p>\n<p>Last night in Hawaii, Santa Barbara was outrebounded 38-25, including 17-8 on the offensive boards, which led to 25-7 disadvantage in second chance points.

At the end of the day, it was the rebounding side of things.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine improve to 16-11 and 10-5 in the Big West, moving into a tie for second place with Cal Poly. UCSB on the other hand, falls to 8-20 overall and 3-12 in conference.</p>\n<p>With Riverside losing to UC Davis last night, the Gauchos continue to hold onto the eighth and final playoff spot by a one-game margin.</p>\n<p>Tied at 13 all with 11:43 to go in the first half, the Rainbow Wahine went on an 11-0 run sparked by offensive boards. With 11 offensive rebounds in the first half, four of those 11 points were scored on rebound putbacks. Control of the game remained in Hawaii’s hands the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a lot of miscommunications on defense, but the main reason (for their run) was the rebounding,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We played zone most of the game and I think we had problems finding people to box out.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii continued to stand up to its ranking as the top defensive team in the Big West, holding UCSB to just 21 points in the first half. The Rainbow Wahine also lead the league in rebounding margin, which they exemplified tonight, outrebounding UCSB 22-10 in the first half, creating the separation that would last the entirety of the contest.</p>\n<p>With leading scorer and rebounder Kamilah Martin on the bench due to injury, other players stepped up offensively for the Rainbow Wahine. Four players finished in double figures with senior forward Diane Moore and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana leading Hawaii with 17 points apiece, which is a career-high for Moore.</p>\n<p>“They’ve played four games without [Jackson], so it’s not like this was their first game,” Mitchell said. “Because of their style of play, they’re not making any major adjustments. They do such a great job of having a balanced attack, so they don’t just rely on one player.”</p>\n<p>The biggest bright spot to take away from last night’s game for UCSB was the play of Zornig, who tallied a game- and career-high 28 points and six rebounds on 11-20 shooting.</p>\n<p>“She was just aggressive and took good shots,” Mitchell said. “She was able to attack off of the dribble and has played that way the entire year. I’m extremely proud of her and her growth and maturity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fly home today and will need to prepare quickly for Cal Poly Saturday for senior day. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/","id":511,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[510,509,508],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB-Cal Poly Showdown Set for Tomorrow","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos take on the Mustangs on senior day","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The makings for a storybook ending are set for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>It will be senior day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos can also clinch the eighth and final playoff spot with a victory. A season where Santa Barbara has struggled, a win would send UCSB into the Big West Tournament with momentum.</p>\n<p>And to top it all off, the Gauchos are facing rival Cal Poly, a team Head Coach Mitchell has yet to beat since arriving in Santa Barbara almost three years ago. Only the three seniors know the feeling of winning a Blue-Green rivalry game as they beat the Mustangs March 5, 2011 to become co-champions of the Big West.</p>\n<p>Now all the team has to do is win.</p>\n<p>“These players dictate if we’re going to have five games,” Mitchell said. “They have to know that myself and this coaching staff believe as we have from day one. It has to be a positive energy going into Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>But beating Cal Poly is much more easily said than done.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters tomorrow’s game the underdog with an overall record of 8-20 and a conference mark of 3-12. The Gauchos hold a one-game lead over UC Riverside, which plays Long Beach in its final game. The first time those two teams played, the Highlanders lost 65-52.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly, on the other hand, comes to the Thunderdome in a tie for second place in the Big West standings at 16-12 overall and 10-5 in conference. While the Mustangs seemed invincible to start the season, they have struggled of late, losing four of their last six.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will also be well-rested since it had a buy yesterday. Santa Barbara, however, will have to bounce back quickly from a red-eye flight home after a 73-60 loss in Hawaii last night. The Gauchos were outrebounded 38-25, including 17-8 on the offensive boards, which resulted in a 25-7 second chance points disadvantage.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch always tells us after a loss, ‘you have until midnight and then you have to forget about it and move on to the next one,’” Zornig said. “We just have to forget about this one and go in ready to play. Cal Poly is a good team and they’re our rivals, so it’s about time we get a win against them.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding will once again be crucial tomorrow. Not only is it the biggest statistical difference in the win-loss column for the Gauchos, but the Mustangs lead the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 44.4 per game. UCSB ranks last at 34.0 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Yet, before Santa Barbara can rebound, it will have to play solid defense and force Cal Poly into some bad shots. A team that wins on the offensive end, the Mustangs top the conference in scoring at 77.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s biggest target offensively is last year’s Big West Player of the year Molly Schlemer. The senior center averages 17.3 points per game, leads the Big West in field goal percentage at 55.2 percent and ranks second in rebounding, pulling down 10.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Clearing out the middle for Schlemer is three-point threat and junior guard Ariana Elegado. Elegado ranks right behind Schlemer in scoring in the Big West, putting up a fifth-best 16.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest key will be our defense,” Zornig said. “They have Schlemer inside, who’s a beast in there, and then they have really good outside shooters, so we just have to have a lot of communication on defense.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met up in San Luis Obispo for the first Big West game of the year, the Mustangs were victorious thanks to their star duo. Schemer scored a career-high 37 points on 16-20 shooting along with 15 rebounds while Elegado hit big threes for Cal Poly, recording 30 points. Combining for 67 points, Schlemer and Elegado tallied just three points less than the entire UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>Trying to slow down the 6’5’’ Schlemer inside will be 6’4’’ junior center Clair Watkins. Although Watkins struggled in Hawaii, she is a very different player than when Cal Poly last saw her. Before the Hawaii game, Watkins had caught fire, averaging a double-double in the three previous games.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re better than the first time we played them, but we will use any combination of defenses we need to to hopefully limit [Schlemer],” Mitchell said. “But it’s not a one player show. They have great guards. We know what we have to do and hopefully with one game left on senior day, we’ll put it all together.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54426\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-cal-poly-showdown-set-for-tomorrow/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54426\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-cal-poly-showdown-set-for-tomorrow/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-cal-poly-showdown-set-for-tomorrow/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-cal-poly-showdown-set-for-tomorrow/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-cal-poly-showdown-set-for-tomorrow/","id":521,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[520,519,518],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finishing the Season Strong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-18.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-18.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"On Senior Night, UCSB Tries for 20-Win Season for Third Time in Five Years ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The finish line is within reach for the UCSB men’s basketball team as the second-place Gauchos host Hawaii tonight at the Thunderdome for senior night.

The Gauchos, however, dropped a game at UC Irvine last Thursday, a victory which propelled the Anteaters to first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>While UCSB clinched a position in the conference tournament long ago, the team’s seeding is still in question. Theoretically, the Gauchos could finish with anywhere from the No. 1 to No. 4 seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have to take care of business, we feel this week, because you never know. We think Irvine has a tough game with Fullerton on Thursday,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “You never know what can happen, and we do not want to live with the what-if scenario and we need to win a game this week to assure the No. 2 seed.”</p>\n<p>Leading the effort to regain momentum entering the tournament is junior center Alan ‘Big Al’ Williams. Big Al ranks eighth in the nation in scoring and is second in the country in rebounds per game. Against Hawaii, Big Al powered the Gauchos with game-highs of 20 points and 17 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Equally as impressive has been the play of junior point guard Zalmico Harmon, who ranks second in the nation in assist to turnover ratio as well as second in the conference in assists per game.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will certainly present a challenge to the Gauchos, both down low and on the perimeter. Senior forward Christian Standhardinger is one of the premier big men in the conference, ranking fifth in points and rebounds per game in the conference. Sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Freshman of the Year, ranks 10th in the conference in points and rebounds, giving the Rainbow Warriors a talented low post combo.</p>\n<p>“We actually feel Fotu and Standhardinger are the best 5-4 combo in the league because they do everything,” Coach Williams said. “These two, they have to carry the heavy load scoring, they have to carry the heavy load rebounding and they defend the other team’s bigs, obviously. I think these two kids have as big an impact as any two kids on any team in the league.”</p>\n<p>As for the two Gaucho seniors who will be honored tonight, both have had important impacts on the team both on the court and off the court.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot, these guys have put in so much work into the program. It’s a huge thing for us to be able to get our seniors out of here on a good note,” Big Al said. “We definitely want a lot of fan support because we want to send our seniors out right. If we can get everybody to the game, it’d be really awesome. It’s a televised ESPNU game, big time game for us and we want everybody to be there to support us.”</p>\n<p>Boswell ranks third in UCSB history in three-pointers made, finishing last season as the Big West Sixth Man of the Year and All-Big West Honorable Mention. This past week, the mechanical engineering major was named as UCSB’s male Big West Scholar of the Year for the second consecutive time.</p>\n<p>“Kyle is one of the all-time three-point leaders in our school’s history,” Coach Williams said. “He’s a guy, in the last two years, has drawn an awful lot of attention from everybody we’ve played. People try to make sure that Bos doesn’t get an open look.”</p>\n<p>Moore began his career as a transfer walk-on player last season before earning a scholarship this past season. The forward certainly produced both on the court with his physical and smart play, and in the classroom as he will secure his degree this spring.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting because it’s nice to be honored and I get to do it with my best friend here, my roommate (Boswell),” Moore said. “But it’s a little sad, we’ve been here so long and spent so much time in this gym that it’s a little sad, it’s bittersweet. I think that we’re pretty focused to win. Last two games, senior night, it’s something that you have to win on.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 6 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

Hawaii currently holds the third seed in the Big West at 15-11 overall and 9-5 in conference. For UCSB, a win would go a long way in securing the eighth seed and ensuring it controls its own destiny.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying not to think about [the playoffs],” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We’re just trying to play one game at a time and focus on us. We’re focused on our next game: going to Hawaii and beating them at their place.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii holds the biggest home court advantage in the league with a five-and-a-half hour flight and a two-hour time zone difference separating it from every other Big West team. The Rainbow Wahine are 10-3 at home, including 6-1 during Big West play, with their only home loss coming to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB knows the feeling of victory in Hawaii, defeating the Rainbow Wahine last season on their home court.</p>\n<p>Earlier this season, Santa Barbara nearly came away with the victory in Thunderdome, falling 63-60. Hawaii shot 22-24 from the free throw line, including 19-20 in the second half, compared to 3-6 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Even then, UCSB held a lead in the final period until the Rainbow Wahine went to star senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who scored six straight points to give Hawaii a three-point lead with under a minute to go.</p>\n<p>“[From that game, we take] learning how to close games out,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’re pretty good for long stretches, but it came down to the last four minutes where a couple things fell apart. We have to learn how to win.”</p>\n<p>Jackson continues to lead Hawaii offensively, averaging 15.5 points and 9.7 rebounds while shooting 50.4 percent from the field. However, Jackson has not played in the last four games after suffering a foot injury against UC Riverside Feb. 13. It is unknown whether she will suit up tonight.</p>\n<p>In Jackson’s absence, the Rainbow Wahine have still been solid, going 3-1. Stepping up have been senior guard Shawna-Lei Keuhu, who leads the team in scoring during conference play with 12.2 points per game and scored a team-high 15 points in the Thunderdome, and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana, who averages 10.2 points per game. A big, physical team known for playing four power forwards and a point guard, Hawaii has plenty of options.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious they’ve found other players to step up and they’re winning without [Jackson],” Mitchell said. “She is a big-time player, but you can’t just focus on her. It won’t change our game plan at all [if she doesn’t play].”</p>\n<p>On the other end, the big emerging player for UCSB has been junior center Clair Watkins, who is a very different player than when Hawaii last saw her. In her last three games, Watkins has averaged a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Clair’s] major,” Mitchell said. “I know that. She knows that. We need her to get the paint and score.”</p>\n<p>Yet don’t expect an offensive battle tonight as both teams are very defensive minded. Under Mitchell, the Gauchos have been a team that prides itself on its defense and the Rainbow Wahine currently lead the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 60.7 points during conference play.</p>\n<p>“First of all, [the fact that they’re in first] frustrates me because that should be us and it was us in the past,” Mitchell said. “They’re big, they’re strong and they’re physical. I tell our team, ‘it’s a compliment — they play like old ladies.’ They don’t beat themselves. They make the right decisions, and they do all the blue-collar things that allow them to be where they’re at in the conference standings.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 9 p.m. Pacific Time at Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/","id":510,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[509,508,507],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to UCD in Play for Kay Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WBasketball_Cameryn_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WBasketball_Cameryn_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB remains in eighth place in the Big West standings despite a loss to UC Davis on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Slow starts are very difficult to recover from in the game of basketball.

Offensively, UCSB failed to find an offensive rhythm against the Aggies’ zone defense, turning the ball over nine times and taking poor quality shots. In the first half, the Gauchos shot 39.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“They were changing up their defense. We haven’t seen a 3-2 [zone] yet this year,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We were trying different things, but we had a lot of unforced turnovers. We were just playing scared. We weren’t attacking like we normally do. We settled for jump shots. Our game is to attack and if we don’t attack, we struggle.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, Santa Barbara struggled to contain the bigger, stronger Davis team. The Aggies got into the lane with ease and each time UCSB did get the game into single digits, the team couldn’t earn the critical defensive stop.</p>\n<p>Davis shot 56 percent from the field in the first half and outscored UCSB 14-4 in the paint. On the game, the Aggies also outrebounded the Gauchos 41-34.</p>\n<p>“Some of them were just straight line drives,” Mitchell said. “When they’re a great three point shooting team, it stretches your man defense, and the so the weak-side help was slower getting there than it typically would be.”</p>\n<p>After going down by 13 just over five minutes into the game, the lead was extended to 18 points late in the first half.</p>\n<p>Opening the second half down by 14, the Gauchos played UC Davis virtually even at 26-24. In fact, Santa Barbara had the momentum with 7:28 remaining when UCSB completed a 7-2 run to bring the gap to 13 points, but approximately 10 seconds later, junior center Clair Watkins fouled out, sparking a 13-4 run for Davis.</p>\n<p>“The big run early set the tone,” Mitchell said. “We’d get [the lead] down to 10, 11 or 12 and couldn’t get it below double figures.”</p>\n<p>Watkins finished the afternoon with 11 points while Zornig led the team with 12 points and three assists on 5-10 shooting.

The Aggies rallied, trailing by as few as three points before UCSB regained command, taking a 32-23 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Big Al quickly picked up two fouls within the first two minutes of the second half, giving the junior center four in the game and forcing the Gauchos to turn elsewhere for offensive production.</p>\n<p>Following Big Al’s fourth foul, Bryson scored seven straight points for the Gauchos, giving the team an 18-point lead with 16:31 remaining in the game, its largest lead of the game. Davis would creep to as close as an eight-point deficit, but the Gauchos’ early second-half advantage proved to be insurmountable.</p>\n<p>Despite playing only 16 minutes, Big Al still managed to post a respectable eight-point, 10-rebound performance and now ranks second in the nation in rebounds per game. A pair of sophomore forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler were called upon to play more minutes with Big Al in foul trouble. Each played 17 minutes, with Brewe registering eight points and Beeler pulling down seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>Both proved valuable down low for the Gauchos, as the team controlled the glass with a 43-20 advantage in rebounds on the game.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon continued his stellar play with 11 points, six assists, four rebounds and only one turnover. Harmon ranks second in the nation in his assist to turnover ratio this season.</p>\n<p>Still, the star of the game was Bryson, with his 19 points and seven rebounds. He now ranks second on the team in scoring, right ahead of senior guard Kyle Boswell, who finished with six points on the night.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Corey Hawkins was the only Aggie to register double-digit scoring with 16 points. As a team, Davis shot 38.6 percent from the field compared to a 44.2 percent clip for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now sit in second place in the conference, one game behind Irvine and a game ahead of Long Beach State. With only two games remaining in the regular season, Santa Barbara needs Irvine to drop a game to force a tie for first place in the conference. Each team won on its own floor against each other this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces Hawaii on Thursday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/","id":548,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[547,546,545],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Anteaters After Snapping Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in eighth place in the Big West and will try to win its second straight game Thursday night against Irvine.

We may look to double, and that’s just out of respect for what she can do when she gets the ball.”</p>\n<p>Following Buckley’s lead, the Anteaters rank second in the conference in scoring during league play at 73.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams met up in Irvine, Buckley was the biggest reason her team came away with the 77-60 victory. Buckley was dominant, scoring 27 points on 7-12 shooting, including 13-15 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>She also grabbed 15 rebounds, aiding the Anteaters in winning the rebounding battle 43-28. Santa Barbara currently ranks last in the Big West in rebounding at just 33.9 boards on the season. The statistic carries significant weight in the win-loss column too, with the Gauchos getting 39.9 rebounds in wins compared to 31.1 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure [Buckley] doesn’t touch it,” junior center Clair Watkins said. “That’d be the easiest way to make sure she doesn’t score. It’s going to be up to the post players to stay lower than her and be physical with her.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB will throw multiple defensive looks at Buckley, Watkins will earn plenty of time on the dominant senior. She comes off a solid weekend herself in which she earned her first double-double last Saturday in Santa Barbara’s win over Cal State Fullerton. She scored 10 points and tallied 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton was more finesse and Clair had to guard guards and three-point shooters,” Mitchell said. “Now it’ll be a physical game, so I’ll be interested to see how she does because I think she’s understanding now that that’s what we have to have from her. That was the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Last weekend, the Gauchos split their games, losing to last-place UC Riverside in the team’s most devastating loss of the year before rebounding for a victory over Fullerton. While inconsistency continued to plague the Gauchos in Riverside, UCSB came out strong and sustained its energy for the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>“We all were upset about the Riverside game, but we went into Fullerton with a chip on our shoulder and came out with a lot of energy,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “That’s what won us the game, so if we come with that same energy and mindset for Irvine, I think we should win the game.”</p>\n<p>With three of the team’s final games at home, Santa Barbara has the opportunity to try to improve its seed for the conference tournament. At 8-17 overall and 3-9 in the Big West, UCSB currently stands in the eighth and final playoff spot, 1.5 games up on UC Riverside. Fullerton sits in a three-way tie for fifth place at 13-13 overall and 6-6 in conference.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s still a little hurt from that Riverside game,” Watkins said. “That’s one we should’ve came away with fairly easily, but we have four games left. We have to get all of them.
