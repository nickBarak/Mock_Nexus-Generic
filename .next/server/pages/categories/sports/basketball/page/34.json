Head Coach Dedrique Taylor (formerly the associate head coach for Arizona State) will join the Titans in hopes of transforming the program from the ground up.</p>\n<p>The Titans suffered a devastating 2012-13 season, finishing with a record of 14-18 and 6-12 in the Big West.

In addition, the Titans were ranked eighth in the Big West preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>Although the Titans lost leading scorers Kwame Vaughn and D.J.

CSUN, while dangerous at home, needs to perfect its game on the road to compete in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Northridge so far this season has been an offensive-oriented team. The team ranks fourth in the conference in points scored, averaging 75.3 per game. This high scoring offense has come off the back of this team’s great shooting ability. The Matadors rank second in the conference in three-point field goal percentage and rank first in free throw percentage. On days where these shots may not be falling, CSUN also has the ability to make up for it on second chance points as it ranks second in offensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>While the team’s attack may be sharp in the first 16 games, the defense has sagged off, making it difficult to close teams out and dominate their matchups. The Matadors rank eighth in points allowed this season, giving up an average of 75 a game. With their points scored and points allowed averages being so close, it is easy to see why this team holds a .533 record and an overall average point margin of just 4.3.</p>\n<p>A bright star on the team so far has been guard/forward Stephan Hicks who has scored double-digit points in every contest with the exception of CSUN’s loss to USC early in the season. Hicks leads his team averaging 17.6 points per game. The junior has a substantial field goal percentage of .553 and also contributes on the boards averaging 7.4 rebounds per game, ranking second on the team.</p>\n<p>Much of this team’s success can also be accredited to their other junior star, forward Stephen Maxwell. Maxwell leads his team in rebounds, grabbing 8.6 per game, and field goal percentage with a .591 mark. Where the statistics do not tell the story is Maxwell’s defense. He is a huge presence in the paint for this Matador team and can essentially stop any players playing the three spot and up with his quickness, size and athleticism.</p>\n<p>Northridge begins Big West play Thursday against UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53436\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-state-northridge-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53436\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-state-northridge-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-state-northridge-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-state-northridge-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-state-northridge-mens-basketball/","id":584,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[583,582,581],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Men’s Preview: Hawaii Men’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hawaii.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hawaii.gif?resize=544%2C396&ssl=1","description":"Hawaii looks to be a legitimate contender after finishing with the best non-conference record in the Big West this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its second season in the Big West, the Hawaii men’s basketball team sits in first place entering conference play with a record of 11-3, and is one of the front-runners to take the top seed in the Big West Tournament after placing fifth last year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii rode a five-game winning streak through the end of November and early December, following it up with a 2-1 record in the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic.

The 6’ 8” senior from Munich, Germany transferred to Hawaii two years ago and has been their leading scorer ever since. So far in 2013-2014, Stanhardinger has averaged 17.8 points per game, good for second in the Big West behind only Alan Williams of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In addition to his scoring prowess, he makes an impact on the defensive end with over a block and a steal every game to go with his 7.4 rebound average. Stanhardinger was First Team All-Conference last season and was also named to the preseason All-Conference team this season.</p>\n<p>Hawaii is not a one man show however, as they also bring two more scorers in the Big West’s top-12. Garrett Nevels, a 6’2” junior guard, is averaging 13.6 points per game to go with a 2.3 assist to turnover ratio, good for seventh in conference. Nevels can score in a variety of ways, but is a long-distance specialist with the second-best three point shooting percentage in the conference at 50.9 percent.</p>\n<p>After a great freshman season, 6’8” sophomore forward Isaac Fotu also returns to the Warriors. This season, he has averaged 13.5 points per game on 58.5 percent shooting, good for sixth in conference.</p>\n<p>Fotu is also seventh in the Big West in blocks, securing his status as a dominant defensive force in the paint. Last season, Fotu was named Big West Co-Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p>Brandon Spearman rounds out Hawaii’s big four. The 6’3” senior guard averaged 14.3 points per game in Hawaii’s big wins against Oregon State and Saint Mary’s, and put up 17 in a tough one-point loss to Boise State.</p>\n<p>Spearman can score from anywhere on the floor and is averaging 11.0 points per game, even after a shaky start to the season.

Williams ranks fifth in the nation in scoring (23.5 points per game) and eighth nationally in rebounding (10.7 rebounds per game), while also leading the Big West in each category.</p>\n<p>“They had nobody who could handle him. It didn’t look like anybody on the team could handle him whatsoever,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He’s played very similar to that against some of the best competition on the West Coast that we’ve played. He’s probably as good a gamer, consistently, night in and night out, as anybody that we’ve had here in my 16 years.”</p>\n<p>Leading by a mere five points midway through the first half, the Gauchos went on a 15-0 run to extend their lead to 39-19, essentially putting the game out of reach by halftime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to control the game after the break, outscoring Master’s 40-28 in the second half while holding the Mustangs to a 34.5 shooting percentage throughout the contest.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Mitch Brewe recorded his first career double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Combined with Williams’s performance, the duo helped give UCSB a 45-28 advantage on the glass and provided a major advantage in the post game.</p>\n<p>“[Mitch is] still fully adjusting to what his role will be, but you can tell he is more and more comfortable week after week of playing and he is more of an asset week after week,” Williams said. “He can be that physical presence that we need. Mitch has become a really valuable player for us, and that’s what we envisioned when we recruited him.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 14 points off the bench, while junior point guard Zalmico Harmon and freshman point guard Eric Childress each added six assists for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s victory concluded the nonconference portion of the schedule for UCSB, which featured an impressive victory over Pac-12 school Cal and narrow road losses at the hands of NCAA Tournament contenders UCLA, Colorado and Utah State. The Gauchos enter conference play with the second best nonconference record of any team in the Big West and look to be one of the premiere contenders for the conference title.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we’ve come pretty far. I feel like we can be a lot better,” Big Al said. “We have a lot of areas we can improve on, just little stuff that will turn us from a good team into a great team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins Big West play next Saturday, Jan. 11 at home against rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>A wearing schedule, five of Santa Barbara’s seven games have been decided in the final minutes. UCSB has gone 3-2 in those games.</p>\n<p>Tuesday night on the road at Pepperdine was no exception as UCSB overcame a 14-point first-half deficit to earn the 77-69 victory and the team’s second consecutive road win.</p>\n<p>“It was good for us to finally find ways to win. That’s going to be big for us because we do have a bit of inexperience on this team and as we continue to do that it will really help us,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We just battled. We had a tough first half and we could have quit after that, but we kept at it and knew what we had to do to pull that win out.”</p>\n<p>For the second straight game, Nesbit set a new career high, totaling 26 points on 8-15 shooting. This season, she averages 18.6 points per game and has been extremely efficient, shooting 47.9 percent from the field, including 51.9 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>All three seniors have been critical for the Gauchos this season with senior guard Destini Mason averaging 15.9 points and a team-leading 6.7 rebounds per game and senior guard Melissa Zornig averaging 12.6 points and a team-high 3.6 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with the seniors pulling their weight, Mitchell was waiting for one more player to step up. Against Pepperdine, Santa Barbara received that bench production, with junior guard Kristine Brance giving eight second-half points and five rebounds and sophomore guard Jasmine Ware tallying six points and providing plenty of defensive pressure. This allowed Mitchell to give her seniors a few extra minutes of rest, which is crucial with so many games in such a small period of time.</p>\n<p>“[Tuesday] we were able to trust Kris, Jasmine and [freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright] to give us at least 10 or 15 minutes and produce while they were out there, so I think that was instrumental,” Mitchell said. “It’s critical any time you can get Nic, Mel and Destini to be around the 30-minute mark. That only helps their production and will help us down the road as far as their legs and how many minutes we may need them to play down the stretch.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns home tonight with a 4-3 overall record. NAU, meanwhile, comes to the Thunderdome with a 1-2 mark.</p>\n<p>While the Lumberjacks are a balanced team, they should be a good matchup for the Gauchos as NAU lacks the height UCSB has seen in its last few games.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team,” Nesbit said. “They don’t have as much size as we’ve seen in the past, but they have thicker guards that are going to be more physical and I’m sure will try to post us up. We’re going to see a bit of a different team than we have in the past.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Amanda Frost anchors Northern Arizona’s offense, averaging 21.7 points per game. In the team’s most recent victory over Utah Valley, Frost went off for 30 points.</p>\n<p>Another key matchup for UCSB will be junior forward Erikka Banks, who grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds in the team’s win. On the year, she averages a double-double with 10.3 points and 12.7 boards.</p>\n<p>“Banks is an interesting match-up because she’s 6’0’’, but she’s really a guard averaging 13 rebounds a game. She’s just a competitor,” Mitchell said. “Frost I would probably relate to Mel. She can shoot it, she can put it on the floor, and then around the basket she has euro step throughs, so she scores in a variety of ways.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, rebounding will be important for UCSB tomorrow A statistic that consistently predicts the result on the scoreboard, the Gauchos average 38.2 rebounds when they win compared to 25.3 boards when they lose.</p>\n<p>The other key factor for Santa Barbara will be turnovers. This season, UCSB averages an impressive 12.6 giveaways per game. On the other hand, the Gauchos would like to take advantage of the Lumberjacks’ turnovers as Northern Arizona has struggled with throwing the ball away, averaging 20 per game in its three games so far.</p>\n<p>“We’re making less mental mistakes,” Nesbit said. “Being aggressive, the turnovers we can live with are the ones in transition where you try to make something happen, but I think we’re starting to limit the unforced turnovers that happen for no reason. We’re playing a bit smarter and that’s something that’s really valuable for us right now.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/","id":590,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[589,588,587],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downed by NAU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos get blown out 79-56","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Typically the UCSB women’s basketball team is known for its defense.</p>\n<p>It’s how the Gauchos have won games the last two seasons.

On the game, Northern Arizona shot 56.9 percent, including 62.5 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>“54 points in the paint – I think that’s the average number of points we gave up last year total,” Mitchell said. “Some of it was post defense on the weak side. We got caught behind on that and the second part of that is the screen and roll defense because we were getting beat to the middle of the lane on dribble penetration on the screen and roll. We just had breakdowns in every aspect of our man to man defense.”</p>\n<p>Despite holding the Lumberjack’s biggest offensive threat in senior guard Amanda Frost to 13 points, over seven points less than her season average, UCSB had no answer for junior forward Erikka Banks. One of five players in double figures, Banks totaled a double-double with 23 points on 9-11 shooting and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos were outrebounded 39-26, leading to an 18-6 second chance points advantage for Northern Arizona.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t block out. That’s just basic fundamentals of what we do,” Mitchell said. “As good as we’ve been against bigger teams – I thought we did a decent job against San Diego State and we did a decent job against a bigger, stronger, athletic Arizona team – we went away from all the fundamental principles tonight of doing the little things you have to do to win. They wanted it more than us tonight.”</p>\n<p>During the first half, Santa Barbara found a way to stay in the game due to its proficient shooting. Senior guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 13 of her 17 points and as a team, the Gauchos shot 42.9 from the field, allowing Santa Barbara to head into the locker rooms with the game knotted up at 30-30.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB went ice cold to begin the second half, going 1-7 from the field, which led to a 13-0 run by the Lumberjacks. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the shooting woes didn’t improve with time as the Gauchos shot a dismal 29.6 percent in the second half and were outscored 49-26.</p>\n<p>“In the second half, there was just no energy. I think from the beginning of the game there was no energy, but at least the first half we were hitting some shots,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “The second half, it seemed like we just stopped and gave up.”</p>\n<p>With the loss, Santa Barbara falls to 4-4 overall while NAU improves to 2-2 on the year. The game was the third in the last six days for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have no excuses,” Mitchell said. “I think human nature, you can use that (we’ve played three games in six days), but once we play Big West we play Thursday and then on Saturday, so we can’t look at that as a reason for effort mistakes.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now receive a 10 day vacation for finals before travelling to Kansas State Dec. 15.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53371\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-downed-by-nau/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53371\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-downed-by-nau/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-downed-by-nau/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-downed-by-nau/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-downed-by-nau/","id":591,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[590,589,588],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Cal For First Time Since 1979","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-18.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-18.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts Cal on Friday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After falling to UCLA in a competitive game on Tuesday, the UCSB men’s basketball team will face yet another tough opponent when it hosts Cal tomorrow at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the matchup with a 3-3 record after falling to the No. 19 Bruins 89-76.

With Williams, Santa Barbara is 3-1, the lone loss coming to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“We’re encouraged by the fact that we can compete in a game like this in the future. We had a good shot at putting them away and getting the upset,” Boswell said. “We have to take out the positive things because we have a huge game on Friday against Cal coming to our place. We just know that we can play with anyone and we’ve proven that this year.”</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, UCSB did not look like a team from a smaller conference facing a power conference team. Instead, Santa Barbara battled for the majority of the game, taking a 42-42 tie into the half at legendary Pauley Pavilion. UCSB even led in the second half before a run by the Bruins put the game out of reach. Big Al led the Gauchos with 23 points to go along with eight rebounds, but the outside shooting of UCSB was the real storyline in this game.</p>\n<p>Boswell finished with 18 points shooting 5-9 from behind the arc. Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Bryson and junior guard Zalmico Harmon each shot 3-5 from the three while sophomore forward Taran Brown was 2-6. Overall, UCSB shot 50 percent on threes, including an impressive 9-14 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of good shooters on the perimeter surrounding Al down low, so if we’re not hitting threes and having people close down on us hard, we’re going to go inside,” Boswell said. “If we go inside and they’re doubling Al, we’re going to kick it out. We have a lot of inside-outside game that we pride ourselves on, especially with two quick point guards that can get into the lane.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to another Pac-12 opponent, UCSB hosts a Golden Bears’ squad that defeated Big West team UC Irvine 73-56 on Monday. Senior guard Justin Cobbs leads Cal with 14 points and over six assists per game. Senior forward Richard Solomon will provide a formidable opponent down low against Big Al, as the senior averages a double-double with over 11 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly has the weapons to challenge the Golden Bears, led by Big Al’s Big West leading numbers of 27.5 points, 10.8 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. Bryson ranks second on the team with 12.7 points per game, while Boswell is third at 11 points and Brown fourth at 10.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup against Cal looms as the Gauchos biggest nonconference home game of the season.</p>\n<p>“[A victory against Cal] would be huge. UCLA was a really big team and that just showed us just how dominant Big Al is,” Boswell said. “We nearly beat Utah State and Colorado even without Al, so the fact that he’s going to be a presence on Friday, they’re going to have to pick their spots. He’s going to cause a lot of problems for Cal so hopefully we’ll take advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s tip-off against Cal is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We’re starting to find ways to win and I’m really, really enjoying that,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “It’s always really fun when you have girls that are willing to battle it out for 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Down the stretch, the Gauchos’ seniors stepped up and made clutch free throws, going 10-10 from the line. Tied at 67 with just over a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig was fouled on her shot. She hit both free throws to give her team a two point lead and then Nesbit was fouled on her drive nearly a minute later, resulting in a four point advantage for UCSB after she drained both her foul shots. The two possession game would prove too much for the Waves to overcome.</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive game, Nesbit set a new career-high, tallying 26 points in the victory.</p>\n<p>“She’s just a warrior,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think sometimes against zones she gets hesitant, so I just challenged her to take over and that’s not a first for her anymore. Now she knows she can do whatever it takes for us to win and she shouldn’t feel bad if she needs to take 20, 10 or 50 shots for us to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 4-3 overall, including 1-2 on the road, while Pepperdine drops to 2-6.</p>\n<p>“We had an attack mentality,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes in the past, our team has played not to lose instead of playing to win and I think our kids tonight knew they were going to win the game.”</p>\n<p>While the score might resemble a solid game by the Gauchos, the majority of the first half looked just the opposite for Santa Barbara. Grabbing 10 offensive rebounds and taking advantage of nine UCSB turnovers, Pepperdine jumped out to an early double-digit lead.</p>\n<p>The nine first half turnovers were only 3.5 less than the team’s season average of 12.5 per contest. However, UCSB gave the ball away just four times in the second half.</p>\n<p>“I think we were all kind of shaky (in the first half),” Zornig said. “When we play teams that play a zone, a lot of times we stand still and we freeze and a lot of times we panic and don’t know what to do.”</p>\n<p>Rather than waiting for the halftime break to regroup, UCSB found its stride with 2:13 to go in the first half. A jumper by Destini Mason sparked a 10-2 run to end the half, which was extended to a 17-4 to begin the second half, closing the gap to one point only two minutes into the second half.</p>\n<p>With a variety of players giving quality minutes in the second half, the Gauchos grinded out their second consecutive road victory. Mason and Zornig both came close to totaling double-doubles, combining for 29 points and 17 rebounds while junior guard Kristine Brance added eight points, all of which came in the second half, and five rebounds. Sophomore guard Jasmine Ware also contributed six points and five boards.</p>\n<p>“It was a great win. I’m not going to hesitate on that one,” Mitchell said. “We got critical minutes off our bench. Nic, Mel and Destini have been really consistent in their play, but we can’t win when they’re having to play 40 minutes a game, so tonight we were able to trust Kristine, Jasmine and [freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright] to give us at least 10 or 15 minutes and produce while they were out there, so I think that was instrumental that we had all nine players getting minutes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB receives just one day of rest before returning home to play Northern Arizona Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/","id":593,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[592,591,590],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels South to Face Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos try to rebound from 71-67 loss to SDSU tonight against Pepperdine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team’s ability to have short term memory will be tested this week.</p>\n<p>Just three days off a rough loss to San Diego State, the Gauchos play Pepperdine on the road tonight, the first of two games in the next three days.</p>\n<p>“We take each game game by game,” freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “It sucks to lose, but we have to let it go and move forward because we do have other games.

Even then, senior guard Nicole Nesbit was given a wide-open three to tie the game in the few second remaining, but missed.</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team with a career-high 22 points. Moving over to the shooting guard position this season, Nesbit currently ranks third in the Big West in scoring with 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“When you play the point, the mentality is to pass first, shoot second,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Onome’s thought process is to dribble penetrate and get everyone else involved, so that frees up Nic and allows her to have legs late in the game because she’s not having to handle the ball against pressure for 40 minutes. In critical moments, she knows and understands we want the ball in her hands.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB shot a season-high 9-19 from three point range, in the second half, the team began settling for jumpers instead of attacking the rim, playing into the tactics of the Aztecs, who played a zone defense.</p>\n<p>Tonight, Santa Barbara will see a zone once again against Pepperdine, who will look to pack the paint.</p>\n<p>“Zones are so different for people and sometimes I smile and sometimes I want to pull my hair out because when you have players that can dribble penetrate and can shoot, they have all the different elements, but there’s something about a zone that sometimes makes them hesitant,” Mitchell said. “When you’re playing one on one or man defense, it’s a lot easier to use your skill or ability to either create your own shot or create for others. Zones make everyone have to be on the same page.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine enters tonight’s matchup at 2-5. Losers of four straight games, all of which were on the road, the Waves return home in need of a victory.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good team. We have seen some very talented individuals so far, but I think Pepperdine is the team that is the best overall team in understanding their roles and playing well together,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced, play inside-out, they have skilled players as well as athletes, and they’re battle-tested.

One of eight players on the roster listed at six feet or taller, she led SDSU to a phenomenal 65.9 percent shooting performance from the field, including 70.6 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>Down four, Warren stepped outside and knocked down a three to bring her team within one at 45-44. She went on to score San Diego State’s next eight points to give the Aztecs a one point advantage just over halfway through the second half.</p>\n<p>“[Warren] started out at North Carolina. We know she could’ve played anywhere in the country,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’ll have to go back and look at when she scored and how she scored. If we were in man, really the only body type that could match up against her was Big Mel.”</p>\n<p>Despite the Aztec shooting percentage, the Gauchos’ three point shooting kept them in the game. Ranked last in the Big West in threes with just 16 on the year entering the game, UCSB made over half its season total in one game, shooting nine of 19 from behind the arc for 47.4 percent.</p>\n<p>“We were getting wide open looks, but I think more towards the second half, we were taking shots too quickly and weren’t attacking as much as we should have,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “The mentality we should have had from the beginning was to attack.”</p>\n<p>The supremacy by both teams in their respective styles led to a game that would be decided in the final seconds.</p>\n<p>Down six with a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig hit a three to bring the game within one possession. A steal on the inbounds and a converted layup from Nesbit completed a five-point swing, making a game that seemed over anybody’s game.</p>\n<p>“We were just trying to pressure it,” Zornig said. “We wanted to get the ball back. We wanted to press them and see what we could do with it.”</p>\n<p>In its full court press, UCSB forced SDSU to travel and was given the opportunity to take the lead with 48.5 seconds left in the game, but could not create a good shot on the offensive end. On the miss, Santa Barbara was forced to foul and freshman guard Ariell Bostick made one of two free throws to put her team up three.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, Nesbit, who had been hot from distance at 5-7 from behind the arc at the time, received an open look from the left wing, but the three bounced off the back of the iron.</p>\n<p>“We drew it up and knew we needed a look at a three,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the first shot, so Mel came in. She took a look at it and then I did get a good look. We did get the look we wanted. It just didn’t go in.”</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs improve to 1-4, the Gauchos drop to 3-3.</p>\n<p>“With the competitor I am, it’s disappointing to know that’s their first win of the season. That’s frustrating when you’re at home,” Mitchell said. “We had our opportunities. We went into halftime up six and we turned stagnant against that two-three zone (in the second half) and it cost us.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB shot 52.0 percent on the game and had three players in double-figures. Nesbit finished with a game-high and career-high 22 points while senior guard Destini Mason and Zornig tallied with 20 and 14 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We had three players in double figures, but again, it’s our guards,” Mitchell said. “We have to find someone else to give us a scoring punch so [the seniors] don’t have to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to rebound quickly from the loss as they travel to Pepperdine Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A turnover on the other end led to a trey by senior guard Melissa Zornig and a steal and layup in transition from sophomore guard Jasmine Ware completed an 8-0 run for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The increased defensive intensity started by Mason led to a 17-3 run and the Gauchos eventually took a 34-24 lead into the locker room.</p>\n<p>“I think it was our energy on defense that really helped get our offense going,” Ware said. “I think we started talking because we were a little flat in the beginning.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB would give up its lead as Hampton used offensive rebounds to spark a 15-4 run and tie the game at 39 all. In just the first five minutes of the second half, the Lady Pirates grabbed eight offensive boards, which led to nine second chance points.</p>\n<p>On the game, Santa Barbara was outrebounded 46-30, giving up 24 offensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They are amazing athletes and we knew their second, third and fourth opportunity a lot of times is their best shot,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t do a good job of blocking out. No excuses. We are very lucky to win giving up 24 offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>The rest of the half, the two teams traded baskets and for the fourth time this year, the Gauchos played in a game went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>Down two with just over a minute remaining, freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe poked the ball from one of Hampton’s leaders, senior guard Nicole Hamilton, and fed Mason on the fast break, who not only converted the layup, but earned the foul. With the made free throw, Mason gave UCSB a 61-60 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a really hard foul. I was a little hurt, but my teammates were like, ‘it doesn’t really matter. You’re going to have to knock down this free throw,’” Mason said. “I just had to get up and focus on the free throw.”</p>\n<p>Solid defense from the Gauchos on the next possession forced an air ball from Hamilton and the Gauchos were able to finish the Lady Pirates off from the line, going 5-6 down the stretch from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 3-2 on the year while Hampton falls to an identical 3-2 mark.</p>\n<p>Anchoring the team offensively for the Lady Pirates was Bennett, who finished the night with 23 points, 21 coming in the second half, and 16 rebounds. She was one of three players in double-figures for Hampton.</p>\n<p>“It was a really nice win,” Mitchell said. “They’re a very talented team. They probably have a pro player in Alyssa Bennett and even though she ended up with 23 points, we made her work extremely hard for those 23 points, so it’s a great win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to play this Saturday at home against San Diego State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/","id":586,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[585,584,583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tries for Two in a Row at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos take on Hampton at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Many students are heading home for Thanksgiving right now, but for the UCSB women’s basketball team, there is business to be taken care of over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>After spending last weekend on the road, the Gauchos return home for a two-game home stand, taking on Hampton tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is currently 2-2 on the year.

With a final score of 67-62, the Gauchos found a way to come from behind after trailing the entire first half.</p>\n<p>“From this game, we learned we need to bring energy from the start,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “I feel that game wouldn’t have been close if we’d started the game with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>As a shorter team, one highlight was the team’s ability to contain the Broncos’ pair of 6’4’’ centers.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know that Santa Clara had two 6’4’’ players on the floor most of the night and I think we were only outrebounded by one,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Our post defense was much better. We’re finding different ways to win and all our players are contributing.”</p>\n<p>To secure the victory, the trio of Gaucho seniors put the team on their backs, combining for 50 of 67 points. This season, senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Destini Mason and Zornig have combined for 65.3 percent of the team’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Zornig especially found her stride over the weekend, posting 19 points and a career-high nine assists against St. Mary’s, and then scoring 18 against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig is] finding different ways to score,” Mitchell said. “I think early in the year, she was taking a lot of threes and at times they weren’t falling. Now, she has that attack mentality of, ‘Hey, if my three’s not falling, I own the midrange jumper,’ and then also being able to get into the lane and being able to draw fouls.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB settles into the season, one note of improvement the Gauchos will be looking for this week is consistency, as the team has, on multiple occasions this year, started out slow and had to come from behind.</p>\n<p>“We need to understand that we have the ability to close out games and put two halves together and sustain that energy,” Nesbit said. “We need to play as a team because it’s going to take all of us.”</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Hampton will rely on its defense, averaging 66 points per game while holding teams to 57.8 points per game. This season, Santa Barbara has averaged 67.8 points per game while giving up 64 points per contest.</p>\n<p>Hampton also has an impressive trio of scorers. Freshman guard Malia Tate-DeFreitas averages 18 points per game, leading the Lady Pirates. Senior forward Alyssa Bennett ranks second on the team in scoring with 16.8 points per game and senior guard Nicole Hamilton averages 14.3 points and 3.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53300\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53300\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/","id":619,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[618,617,616],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Santa Clara on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-basketball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-basketball.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB snapped a two-game skid on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>What a 67-62 final score says is that the UCSB women’s basketball team beat Santa Clara Saturday night, earning its first road victory of the year.

With 17.3 seconds remaining on the clock, the Broncos almost came up with the steal, tipping the ball out of bounds. On the second chance, UCSB was forced to call a timeout, unable to inbound the ball.</p>\n<p>“We had a press set that should’ve given us three options, but they did a good job of denying Nic,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Then, we went to trying to have Destini get open as well, but they had a lot of pressure on the ball. They had 6’4’’ on the ball, so it had to be a bounce pass to get the ball inbounds.”</p>\n<p>On the third shot, the Gauchos successfully inbounded to Nesbit, the team’s top free throw shooter, who went 4-4 from the free throw line down the stretch to ice the game.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done this hundreds and hundreds of times, probably thousands,” Nesbit said. “You can’t worry about the atmosphere; nothing’s different about it.”</p>\n<p>The win snaps a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos as they improve to 2-2. With the loss, Santa Clara falls to 0-4.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely exciting to get that first road win,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We came in there upset from the last game (against St. Mary’s) and we went in there to fight tonight. We really wanted to win the game, so we went out with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s seniors took the reins in earning their team its first road victory, combining for 50 of the Gauchos’ 67 points. Nesbit, Zornig and Mason finished with 19, 18 and 13 points, respectively. Mason also tallied 10 rebounds for her first double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors stepped up and made critical plays,” Mitchell said. “They didn’t shoot it the best, but Mel found ways to get to the free throw line, Destini got crucial second-chance opportunities late in the game and Nic was able to keep the ball and knock down big free throws late.”</p>\n<p>The biggest difference for the Gauchos was in the turnover category. UCSB turned the ball over just nine times, compared to Santa Clara’s 21 giveaways, leading to 26-6 advantage in points off turnovers. UCSB was also able to contain Santa Clara’s height inside, limiting their two 6’4’’ players to 14 combined points.</p>\n<p>“We stress our defense,” Nesbit said. “We knew going into this game they had a couple legit 6’4’’ players, so we knew we were going to have to full front. You can’t play behind them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Hampton tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/","id":617,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[616,615,614],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops First Road Game of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos fall 89-79 to the Gaels","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has proved itself an offensive force this year, but the Gauchos still couldn’t keep up with the potent offense of St. Mary’s as they fell 89-79 yesterday in their first road game of the season.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara scored the second most points during the Carlene Mitchell era with 79, the 89 points the Gauchos gave up was the most since Mitchell’s arrival to UCSB.

The Gaels were 6-8 from behind the arc and 21-28 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen a team shoot 63 percent from the field, so that was rough,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I don’t think we were as sharp as we couldn’t been defensively.”</p>\n<p>The options were plentiful for St. Mary’s on the offensive end as the team ended the night with four players in double figures. Leading the offense were senior guard Kate Gaze and sophomore guard Lauren Nicholson, who on the season only average 11.7 and 10.7 points per game, respectively. However, with Nared on the bench, the guards stepped up, tallying 26 points apiece. Danielle Mauldin also added a double-double with 18 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They have balanced scoring, so there’s not just one player that can get it done,” Mitchell said. “You have to give them credit for finding the mismatches and taking advantage of it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos drop to 1-2 overall while the Gaels stay perfect on the year, improving to 4-0.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s powerful offense was evident straight from the tip. Nicolson knocked down consecutive threes and St. Mary’s jumped out to a quick eight point, which was kept rest of half.</p>\n<p>“It was a frustrating game,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We let them get the shots they wanted and they knocked a lot of shots down. We just didn’t get it done defensively.”</p>\n<p>To start the final period, Santa Barbara’s seniors put the team on their backs, scoring UCSB’s first 11 first points of the half to cut St. Mary’s lead to just one point.</p>\n<p>All three seniors for the Gauchos finished in double-figures. Zornig scored 19 points, four steals and a career-high nine assists while Mason also had a career-high setting night. She finished with a personal best 18 points and seven rebounds, breaking the career-high she already broke earlier this season when she scored 16 against Occidental. Finally, consistent as always, senior guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 17 points.</p>\n<p>“We know the dynamic of the team and we know we have to step it up to another level,” Mason said. “I’m glad Mel got in her rhythm and started knocking down some stuff. We know we have to be on our game because everyone’s following our lead.”</p>\n<p>But St. Mary’s offense was relentless. An 8-0 run a little over halfway through the half gave the Gaels an 11 point cushion, which would be enough to keep the Gauchos at bay the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will continue its road trip Saturday at Santa Clara. Tip-off is set for 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53191\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53191\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/","id":616,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[615,614,613],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":34,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
