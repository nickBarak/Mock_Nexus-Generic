However, a 10-0 run by Irvine gave the Anteaters a lead they would never again concede. Six of Irvine’s 10 points in the game-changing run came from a pair of threes from Aguilar.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we let shooters get started. Definitely the difference in the game was Vanessa Aguilar,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Once those (threes) went down, we had our hands full because it gave them new life.”</p>\n<p>Down 73-68, Santa Barbara inbounded the ball to Jemerigbe, who dribbled right and found Zornig at the top of the key. She nailed the trey to bring the Gauchos within two with 41 seconds to go.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch drew it up during the timeout,” Zornig said. “We had [senior guard Nicole Nesbit] coming off the flare and she’s a shooter, so they put a lot of attention on her. I set the flare screen and just popped out.”</p>\n<p>However, Nesbit gambled on the inbounds pass, fouling senior guard Kelly Meggs and sending her to the free throw line, which expanded Irvine’s lead up to four.</p>\n<p>Nesbit made up for her mistake quickly, knocking down a clutch jumper on the right wing with 29 seconds left. Nevertheless, Buckley made her shots from the charity stripe on the other end to clinch the victory for the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>Irvine improves to 14-13 overall and 7-6 in the Big West while UCSB drops to 8-18 overall and 3-10 in conference. Since Riverside had a bye yesterday, the Gauchos keep a one-game lead for the eighth and final playoff spot.</p>\n<p>While a loss shows up in the record for Santa Barbara, the team looked much improved from past performances. Nesbit led the team with 20 points while Zornig finished just shy of a double-double with 16 points and nine rebounds. UCSB’s other starters pitched in as well with Jemerigbe adding 13 points and four assists and junior center Clair Watkins also coming so close to tallying the double-double with nine points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We are a team that I don’t want it to be an individual effort,” Mitchell said. “We have some very talented players, but it was the mistakes that cost us the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to play Saturday against UC Davis for its annual Play for Kay game. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/","id":547,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[546,545,544],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Anteaters in Battle of First Place Teams","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-27_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-27_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB battles UC Irvine Thursdau night on the road in a matchup of two teams tied for first place in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team has played some important games this season against the likes of Cal and UCLA, but no game this season may be more important than tonight’s road matchup against UC Irvine, the team tied atop the Big West standings with the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Irvine enter the contest tied for first place in the Big West, each with a 9-3 conference record this season. UCSB is 18-7 overall and has won two straight games, while Irvine is 18-10, previously losing its one-game lead on the Gauchos with a loss to Cal State Northridge last Saturday. Needless to say, tonight’s game in Irvine holds major implications for both teams’ chances to finish on top of the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“I think they’re pretty confident in themselves when we play high level teams and competition,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve played well in big games this year; we played well in the preseason at UNLV and Cal, UCLA and Colorado.

In that victory, however, Irvine was without junior forward Will Davis II, last year’s Big West Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“He’s a key player for them, no doubt. He’s not one of the top three scorers, but what he is, is a really versatile four/five,” Coach Williams said. “Even though you don’t see him at the five much, I think you will see him at times at the five today. I think you’ll see them go to a small team, press us, play small with the five, and it gives them way more versatility than with their big guys they have.”</p>\n<p>Another player to watch for Irvine is freshman Mamadou Ndiaye. The 7’6” freshman is the tallest player in collegiate basketball and ranks 8th in the nation with 3.19 blocks to per game. Irvine features much depth along its starting line with freshman guard Luke Nelson and senior guard Chris McNealy each averaging over 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>Because of its depth, Irvine has played well of late, as the Anteaters were winners of five straight games before falling to Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the test against Irvine,” Coach Williams said. “We’re sure that they will play much better than when they played here against us, and I think we’re ready for the challenge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game with plenty of momentum as well, winning six of its last seven games; the lone loss coming in overtime to the same Northridge team. Leading the Gauchos is junior center Alan Williams. Big Al leads the nation with 12.0 rebounds per game and ranks 8th in the country with 22.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Part of [his rebounding ability is] he creates space, but the other part of it is he’s leaner, he’s moving really well, he’s got great instincts, he follows where the ball is going and he reads it really well,” Coach Williams said. “He’s just got great gifts, tremendous feet, tremendous hands, he’s a very good player.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have come to expect greatness from Big Al, another player in junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has emerged as a game-changer for a UCSB team hitting its stride. Harmon ranks second in the nation with a 4.52 assist to turnover ratio and is second in the conference with over 5.2 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Even more impressive, Harmon has compiled 50 assists and only three turnovers in his last nine games. In addition to his superb ball handling, Harmon has also become an efficient scorer for the Gauchos, notching two 20-point games in the last three contests. In the team’s last game, Harmon racked up 20 points and 10 assists, the first Gaucho to accomplish the feat since 1989.</p>\n<p>“He continues to get better. He makes great decisions and takes great care of the ball, obviously,” Coach Williams said. “He’s shooting the ball with much more confidence now, he’s playing his best basketball of the year and we just kind of expect him to continue to grow.”</p>\n<p>No doubt that on Saturday the Gauchos will rely on what has been working for them all year — feeding Big Al down low and relying on its perimeter shooters to hit outside shots and drive to the rim for open looks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to play tremendous defense against an Irvine squad that ranks first in the conference in field goal percentage at 47.5 percent. Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to under 36 percent in the victory earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounding and will challenge Big Al, the nation’s top rebounder, down low. In the team’s previous matchup, Big Al managed to dominate as he has done all season with 26 points and 10 rebounds, with the Gauchos winning the battle on the glass by eight.</p>\n<p>“There’s high energy, a lot of emotion in this game because it is such a big game and the environment is going to be hostile and they always bring a good crowd,” Big Al said. “It’s definitely going to be a lot of fun to play there and go up against Irvine. We’re really excited. It’s a big game.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s clash between the first-place teams is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center in Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54257\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54257\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/","id":546,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[545,544,543],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"For Love of the Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-basketball-32-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-basketball-32-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Clair Watkins is Getting Her Game Back After Two ACL Tears Derailed Her Career","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One in 10 female NCAA athletes will tear their ACL.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has exactly 10 members.

The Charlotte, NC native was a top-notch recruit, coming off a 4A State Championship, a McDonald’s All-American nomination and was named North Carolina Female Athlete of the Year by the Charlotte Observer during her senior year.</p>\n<p>But at her first ever practice as a freshman, disaster struck.</p>\n<p>“It was the first day of practice and we were just running a full court drill,” Watkins said. “I looked over my shoulder to catch the ball, and I just landed completely straight legged at a really weird angle.”</p>\n<p>Done for the year. Just like that. Watkins had torn her right ACL.</p>\n<p>The injury was in typical fashion for an athlete — a noncontact play where a sudden deceleration or landing maneuver put the leg in a vulnerable position. While ACL injuries most often occur in team sports, 80 percent involve little or no contact with another athlete.</p>\n<p>Watkins redshirted that year and returned to the court as a sophomore, where she made her college debut. As a redshirt freshman, Watkins began to find her stride on the court. Early in the season, she tallied three blocks against University of South Carolina Upstate and four steals against Florida, both of which remain career-highs today.</p>\n<p>Against Sam Houston State in late November, Watkins recorded a career-high 12 points on 6-10 shooting and in early December, she posted a career-high at the time of eight rebounds versus Denver.</p>\n<p>“It was tough, because I was technically a freshman,” Watkins said. “I had a year sitting out, so I was really rusty. I love the team there and it was fun being part of the program, but basketball-wise it was rough because I was still getting my feet back under me. I had to keep up with fast-pace SEC basketball.”</p>\n<p>During her redshirt sophomore year, however, Watkins’ was dealt another tough blow. Leading up to the Tennessee game on Jan. 24, Watkins was at practice and was hit on the side of the knee setting a screen.</p>\n<p>The result was another ACL tear. This time it was the left one, leaving Watkins sidelined the remainder of the season once again.</p>\n<p>“At that point, I’m like, ‘Wait, what is going on? This can’t be happening,’” Watkins said. “It was so surreal. I don’t think I even cried. I cried over the first one a bit because I was disappointed, but the second one, I didn’t even cry because I was like, ‘man, alright, just going to do rehab again’ and it was second-nature to me.”</p>\n<p>Sitting out with her second ACL tear in two years, Watkins realized that the old saying that everything happens for a reason might have some truth to it.</p>\n<p>“The second [ACL tear] was actually a blessing in disguise, because I realized that my time at Vandy was over and that I did what I needed to do there,” Watkins said. “I sat back and thought about my options and realized I wanted to go somewhere else and have a new experience. Oddly enough, if I hadn’t hurt this knee, I don’t think I’d be here right now.”</p>\n<p>Now, Watkins is here at UCSB, but not as an undergrad. She currently studies at the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education, working towards her Master’s in Education.</p>\n<p>Simply because she’s not an undergrad doesn’t mean Watkins’ basketball career is over though. After rehabbing and twice surviving the injury known as “the commonest cause of the ex-athlete,” Watkins is back on the court and playing for the Gauchos with her two remaining years of NCAA eligibility.</p>\n<p>“She’s a lot like [center Kirsten Tilleman from last year] in that they love the game so much that they want to have a positive experience through it,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “With Clair, she wants to have fun again. It’s hard for her to even remember the high school days where that’s where her enjoyment of the game was. Her mom told me when she was here that that was the first time she’d seen [Clair] smile on the floor in a couple years. That means a lot.”</p>\n<p>Not on the roster to start the season, Watkins was taking extension classes during fall quarter. After she was admitted into the university, Watkins was cleared immediately by the NCAA to play.</p>\n<p>Joining the team midseason in late December put Watson at a fairly sizable disadvantage: a new style, new teammates and the expectation of serving as the team’s inside presence. At 6’4’’, Watkins brought height to a guard-driven team lacking in size and experience in the paint.</p>\n<p>“I definitely learned something from each [knee injury]. I’m definitely more appreciative when I do get to play,” Watkins said. “[Being back on the court] is a lot of fun. It’s a lot different than at Vanderbilt with different coaching styles, but I love it. And I get to walk to practice between palm trees with mountain[s] on one side and ocean on the other. It’s paradise out here.”</p>\n<p>So far, in her 15 games for Santa Barbara, Watkins has averaged 5.1 points and 5.5 rebounds, which is second on the team. She also averages 0.9 steals and leads the team with 1.0 block per game.</p>\n<p>While the statistics don’t show a player ready to dominate the Big West, Mitchell knows Watkins needs time, not only to adjust to UCSB’s ways, but find her game again after not being on the court in nearly a year due to the ACL injury.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the game happens really fast when you haven’t played for a long time. There’s nothing you can do to emulate that playing time on the floor,” Mitchell said. “But there’s no pressure; she needs to have fun and finish her career like she deserves to. I still think Clair will leave here being one of the best players in the Big West. Just like Sweets [Underwood] did, she could easily average a double-double every night.”</p>\n<p>A glimpse of the Watkins that caught so many recruiters’ eyes as a freshman was on display this past weekend. While any basketball fan could see Watkins had the skill, it’d yet to show up in the box score.</p>\n<p>Saturday at Cal State Fullerton, Watkins shined, earning the first double-double of her career. She scored 10 points and grabbed a career-high 15 rebounds, giving UCSB the presence inside it’d been missing all year long.</p>\n<p>“When basketball has been tough for her the way it has for her the last two years, it’s easy for her to get down on herself,” Mitchell said. “We’ve worked really hard on keeping her confident and reminding her every day that she could dominate in this conference. She’s an amazing talent, and we have to make sure she continues to work on her game and consistently gives us those numbers every night because there’s no reason she can’t.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of Feb. 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/","id":542,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[541,540,539],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Moves Into Tie for First in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=921%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos defeat Fullerton 80-65","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off of a close win over UC Riverside Thursday, the UCSB men’s basketball team needed a win over Cal State Fullerton Saturday to move into first place in the Big West.

Harmon knocked down a pair of threes and matched Fullerton’s entire team with 10 points just eight minutes into the game.</p>\n<p>“Anytime we can get a win like that in a fashion where everybody’s playing well, hustling and executing, it’s always a great feeling,” Harmon said.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos extended their lead to 27-10, it was smooth sailing. The Titans went on a run to cut the deficit to 32-21, but with less than 30 seconds left in the half, Harmon found sophomore forward Taran Brown for a two-hand facial dunk, sending UCSB to the half with the momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s always exciting to get a dunk because you get the crowd into it and you get your teammates all going crazy on the bench,” junior center Alan Williams said. “It’s an opportunity to increase your level of energy and it’s on [your teammates] to match that.”</p>\n<p>As he has all year, Williams dominated both offensively and defensively. From the opening minutes, the big man played with an extra bounce in his step, making it look easy on his way to a 22-point, 18-rebound double-double on 8-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Titans fought back for the entire second half, led by guard Michael Williams. The senior single-handedly kept his team in the game, scoring a game-high 29 points and knocking down 5-10 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos always found an answer, however. Big Al gobbled up every rebound he could reach in the second half, and a one-hand highlight dunk off a loose ball pushed UCSB’s lead back up to 46-29 with just under 13 minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>With just four minutes to go, a three-pointer by Michael Williams cut the Gauchos’ lead to 63-54. The next time down the court, Bryson answered with another UCSB dunk, pushing the lead back up to 11 and dismantling any hope of a Titan comeback. Santa Barbara closed out the final minutes by knocking down free throws on their way to an 80-65 win.</p>\n<p>“It got a little closer [in the second half] but it was nice not to have to fight until the bitter end,” Bryson said. “We’re on a good track right now.”</p>\n<p>Harmon ended the night with 20 points and 10 assists while committing zero turnovers. In his last nine games, he has accumulated 49 assists and just three turnovers.</p>\n<p>“There’s no way we’ve had a player go through a stretch like this since I’ve been here,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He’s been amazing and has just gotten better and more confident as the season’s gone on. He’s absolutely a stud and he’s getting better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to the road for a first-place showdown against UC Irvine this Thursday.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of Feb. 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/","id":545,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[544,543,542],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Rebounds Against CSUF on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos defeat Fullerton 64-54","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lack of consistency has been the UCSB women’s basketball team’s weakness all season long.</p>\n<p>Falling victim to coming out slow in both halves has resulted in a poor conference season for the Gauchos.

We had a lot of collapses late in the game, but [the key was us mixing] it up tonight,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think a lot of teams are nervous to play Fullerton because they can shoot it so well. By extending our zone, it was causing some issues [for them].”</p>\n<p>Plus, on a guard-driven team, UCSB finally found its post presence inside. At 6’4’’, Watkins headed the Gauchos’ zone defense and her height helped hold Fullerton from downtown. Then on offense, she earned the first double-double of her career with 10 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“That’s the personality and identity we’ve been looking for,” Mitchell said. “We had an inside presence (tonight) and it makes a world of difference when you can get double figures from an inside post player. That, by far, was the biggest difference in what we did tonight over any of our previous [25] games.”</p>\n<p>With the win, Santa Barbara improves to 8-17 overall and 3-9 in the Big West, keeping its playoff hopes alive with four games remaining on the season. Fullerton drops to 6-6 in conference and 10-15 overall.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began the game with energy, going on a 9-0 run, which UCSB held onto to take a 28-22 lead going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms, UCSB continued to increase its lead, extending the margin to 19 points with just under four minutes remaining. While Fullerton made a push in the final minutes, the large lead would be enough to keep the Titans at bay.</p>\n<p>“We were excited at halftime and happy about the way we were playing. We looked at each other and said, ‘They came back last time. We don’t want it to happen again,’” Watkins said. “There was a will to win because we just didn’t want a repeat of last time. The last couple minutes, I think everyone had a slight heart attack on the bench, but we were able to pull it out.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB shot 49.1 percent from the field compared to 33.9 percent for Fullerton. The Gauchos also outscored the Titans 32-22 in the paint.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos gave up a game-high 29 points to Titan senior guard Alex Thomas, Santa Barbara featured three players in double figures. While senior guard Nicole Nesbit led the team with 19 points and six rebounds on 8-16 shooting, it was a career night for senior guard Melissa Zornig, who reached the 1,000-point mark with her first basket of the game. Zornig finished the night with 18 points and four assists.</p>\n<p>“[She brings] so much consistency and leadership. She’s a very selfless player and it’s encouraging to coach someone who will do anything for the team to win,” Mitchell said. “She wasn’t worried about the thousandth point, but it’s nice for her to be able to have that for her scrapbook someday and to be able to sit down with the grandkids and let people know that back in the day that she was a scorer.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home next weekend for its final road series of the regular reason, facing UC Irvine Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>That situation completely changed tonight when UCSB fell to Riverside on the road 67-57, blowing a 10 point second half lead.</p>\n<p>“Definitely, [after tonight, playoffs] cross your mind when you drop one like this, but we’re continuing to look forward,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’ll think about this one until midnight and then look to what we have coming next.”</p>\n<p>With the loss, the Gauchos fall to 7-17 overall and 2-9 in conference. They do remain a half game up on the Highlanders, which improved to 6-19 overall and 1-10 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara takes the loss, the team actually owned the lead the majority of the game. After a 9-0 run late in the first half, UCSB extended its lead to 10 points at 37-27 with 13:23 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>From there, it was all Riverside. A three by the Highlander’s leading scorer and sophomore guard Brittany Crain capped off an 11-0 run for UCR, giving the team its first lead since midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t stop the bleeding as Riverside extended the run to 28-7, putting Santa Barbara in an 11-point hole with little time left on the clock.</p>\n<p>“They got after us more on the defensive end. They started trying to deny Nic and [senior guard Melissa Zornig], so it made it tough for us to run patterns. It’s human nature when that happens to go into panic mode and we had the wrong people taking shots late in the shot clock,” Mitchell said. “We’re too late in the year. We have to understand who the offense needs to go to and through and then be able to get stops on the other end.”</p>\n<p>Despite a solid first half, holding the Highlanders to 19 points, UCSB gave up 48 second half points as it was outscored 48-33.</p>\n<p>On the game, UCSB didn’t shoot well, shooting 34.4 percent from the field. Riverside’s offense, on the other hand, resembled its attack from last Saturday when the team shot 53.8 percent from the field, defeating UC Irvine for its first conference victory. Tonight, the Highlanders shot an incredible 56 percent from the field in the second half.</p>\n<p>“They were knocking down shots,” Nesbit said. “Everything that they were putting up it seemed like was going in and with that comes lots of energy and momentum. Once they started to get hot, everyone started to bring tons of energy.”</p>\n<p>Crain led UCR offensively, recording a double-double with 28 points and 11 rebounds. Freshman guard Simone DeCoud also stepped up with 18 points. During Riverside’s 28-7 run in the second half, the two combined for 22 of the 28 points.</p>\n<p>“You have Brittany Crain, who’s the leading scorer in the Big West, and we’re not matched up with her in transition defense or we had our five player guarding her,” Mitchell said. “That tells me there’s a lack of focus or in transition we didn’t communicate because she got two or three open threes with our five player guarding her.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the seniors led the way once again. Both Nesbit and senior guard Melissa Zornig finished with 16 points while senior guard Destini Mason added 11 points.</p>\n<p>“The kids read the internet. They understand our record,” Mitchell said. “With this team, it’s probably a little more pressure than they handle. We need to focus on what we need to do and hope it will lead to a couple wins in the final five games of the season.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to regroup quickly for Saturday’s game at Cal State Fullerton. Tipoff is set for 6 p.m. at Titan Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/","id":540,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[539,538,537],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces UCR With Postseason on the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-3_Vandendelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-3_Vandendelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces Riverside in a game that could determine which team receives the final spot in the Big West Tournament.

There are always seniors on another team that sometimes aren’t looking at the record,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They’re trying to extend their playing careers and go out on a good note. I know we’re probably going to get their best game, no doubt about it, especially since they were our first conference win.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the matchup in eighth place at 2-8 in conference and 7-16 overall. The Highlanders are currently in the cellar of the Big West standings at 1-10 in league and 5-19 overall. With only the top eight teams going to playoffs, this game could have serious postseason implications.</p>\n<p>All season, consistency has been the biggest problem for UCSB. Even this past weekend, the Gauchos beat Long Beach in a nearly flawless game, scoring a season-high 80 points while forcing the 49ers into 22 turnovers before falling in blowout fashion to Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on putting two games together. We know that we can be a spectacular team one night and not so good another night,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’re trying to limit those highs and lows and continue to be positive and use the momentum to make good things happen. For us, it’s going to be about putting two games together, especially on the road.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the Long Beach game, Santa Barbara fell behind early against the Matadors and could never recover. The Gauchos were also dominated on the boards as Northridge outrebounded UCSB 55-28.</p>\n<p>As a result, the focus this week for UCSB was rebounding. In fact, in the Gauchos’ first conference victory this year when they beat Riverside 74-61 in the Thunderdome, Santa Barbara won the rebounding battle by a wide margin, 55-30, including 21-6 on the offensive boards. This led to 23 second-chance points and the Gauchos outscoring the Highlanders 34-6 in the paint.</p>\n<p>This season, UCSB averages 40.0 rebounds in victories compared to 30.6 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We keep getting reminded that we had 55 rebounds (last time against UCR), which was our highest rebounding game this year,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “That’s obviously what let us win the game, so if we focus on that, we should be good.”</p>\n<p>After losing 16 straight games, Riverside finally earned its first conference win Saturday 87-75 over UC Irvine. The Highlanders won the game on the offensive end, shooting 53.8 percent from the field and a phenomenal 61.1 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Leading Riverside, per usual, was sophomore guard Brittany Crain. She scored 22 against Irvine and was one of four players in double-figures for the Highlanders. On the season, Crain leads the Big West in scoring at 18.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you’re ever going to stop a great player like her, but we have to make her work,” Mitchell said. “With a player like that, you have to ID her at all times and make her work to score her points.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end for UCSB, the Gauchos will continue to look to their seniors. Nesbit led the team with 20 points in the last matchup while Zornig also added 16 points.</p>\n<p>Recently, Zornig has caught fire, recording her first career double-double in Northridge with 21 points and 11 rebounds, including 4-6 shooting from behind the arc. The leader in three-point percentage during conference play at 57.4 percent has hit at least two threes in eight straight games and currently stands 17 points shy of 1,000 points.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] continues to have an attack mentality and she’s shooting the ball with confidence,” Mitchell said. “She’s taking good shots, she’s being assertive on the offensive end and she’s also rebounding. She’ll get two or three rebound putbacks every game, so she’s scoring in a variety of ways.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at SRC Arena.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/","id":537,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[536,535,534],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts UC Riverside at the Thunderdome With Six Games Left in the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in second place in the Big West with six games remaining in the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With six games left on its schedule, the UCSB men’s basketball team enters the final stretch of the regular season in hopes of finishing atop the Big West Conference standings.

In that contest, UCSB took an 11-point lead and built it to an eventual 17-point advantage in the second half. The Gauchos struggled to close out the game, however, allowing Riverside to creep back and send the game to overtime before an eventual 68-65 victory avoided an epic collapse.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had several of these this year where we’ve had leads and we’ve let things slip away. We have to develop more of a killer instinct to finish games,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We have to get hungrier in terms of our approach to each game and how we play for 40 minutes in the game. All of a sudden we’re up and you see us relax a little bit and that’s a dangerous habit to be falling into.”</p>\n<p>Closing out games has become a major area of concern for Santa Barbara and hurt the team in last Saturday’s 80-78 overtime loss to Cal State Northridge despite holding a seven-point lead with just over a minute remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s loss, UCSB failed to score in the final two minutes of overtime and turned the ball over 18 times during the entire contest. Turnovers will certainly be a key to Thursday’s contest as Riverside ranks last in the Big West with over 13 turnovers committed per game, compared to second-best UCSB with 11.4 per game.</p>\n<p>“In that Northridge game, there were certain plays we didn’t run and we didn’t do all the tasks that we needed to do to win that game and it came back to bite us,” junior center Alan Williams said. “We’ve really got to focus up on that and be more mentally tough and I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters the contest with an 8-17 overall record and 3-8 mark in conference play, which places the team last in the Big West standings. The Highlanders are currently on a three-game losing streak at the hands of three of the top teams in the conference in Long Beach, Hawaii and Irvine.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we just come out and we try to assert ourselves more consistently throughout a 40-minute game instead of the lapses that we’ve been having,” Coach Williams said. “Hopefully our familiarity is good with them, but I think they’re a better team. They’re a better team now than they were earlier this year.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders will be a pair of forwards in senior Chris Patton and sophomore Taylor Johns. Patton leads the team with 13.3 points per game, while Johns trails right behind at 13.1 per game. Johns also ranks third in the conference with 8.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game ranked No. 13 in College Insider’s Mid-Major poll, powered by the play of Big Al. Williams ranks ninth in the nation in scoring at 22.7 points per game and is second in the country with 11.5 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Playing well as of late for the Gauchos is point guard Zalmico Harmon who ranks third in the nation with a 4.07 assist to turnover ratio. Against Northridge, the junior scored a career-high 21 points, dished out eight assists and committed only one turnover.</p>\n<p>“If we play our game, we’re able to beat anybody in this league,” Bryson said. “When we get let down is when we start kind of being nonchalant with our actions and nonchalant with our execution, so I think if we really play 40 minutes of basketball … we’ll come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Thursday’s contest at the Thunderdome is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/","id":539,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[538,537,536],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kyle Boswell: A True Student Athlete","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-12.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-12.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Boswell Balances One of the Toughest Majors on Campus With His Critical Role For UCSB Basketball","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The technical terms ‘high-post screen’ and ‘thermodynamics’ are often discussed in different circles and rarely intermix in a conversation.

While at Edison, Boswell became the all-time leader in career points, averaging over 23 points per game as a senior behind a deadly perimeter shot. That outside shot garnered the attention of UCSB, a dream come true for Kyle, who was interested in more than just basketball.</p>\n<p>With a scholarship in hand, Boswell knew he wanted to become a Gaucho and major in mechanical engineering, but faced road blocks in achieving that goal from the time he stepped on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our engineering program is definitely at the top of the line. I didn’t get into the program because it was so competitive,” Boswell said. “I had to petition and take some courses and compete against some of the people for them to even consider me to get into the major. After about a year and a half, they told me my performance in the classroom was good enough to let me in. That in itself was a blessing.”</p>\n<p>His 3.8 GPA is evidence enough that he warranted a spot in an engineering program that often ranks in the top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>Moving onto campus, Boswell had the task of balancing more than your average Gaucho had to, adjusting to college life and taking engineering courses in addition to his duties as a basketball player. During his freshman year, Boswell played a reserve role for a team that advanced to the NCAA Tournament, starting six of the 21 contests he played in.</p>\n<p>During his sophomore season, Boswell truly became an outside weapon for Santa Barbara, leading the team in three-point field goal percentage while ranking in the top four in minutes played. This is when Boswell emerged as a sixth man for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I absolutely love being the sixth man. I like to kind of sit back for a couple minutes in the game, see the landscape and how the flow’s going, how our team’s playing and what I need to do coming off the bench,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Since then, Boswell has volunteered to come off the bench, a role in which he has certainly found success. Last season, Boswell averaged 13 points per game on his way to the Sixth Man of the Year award and all-conference honorable mention. This year, he ranks second on the Gauchos in scoring with 11 points per game and currently ranks third in school history in three-pointers made.</p>\n<p>Aside from his success on the court, Boswell has received tremendous recognition for his ability to balance academics as well. This past fall Boswell was named one of 30 semi-finalists for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, was named the Big West Scholar Athlete of the Year for men’s basketball and is also a two-time recipient of the Golden Eagle award for academic excellence.</p>\n<p>“In terms of being successful here as a student athlete, anyone can do it. I’m not like a freak of nature, who, like no other kid in the school, can do what I do,” Boswell said. “You’ve honestly got to love what you do and just put in the work. It’s the lifestyle; you’ve got to embrace the challenge and give it all you got.”</p>\n<p>While not unheard of, being a student-athlete in the engineering department is certainly rare, and something Boswell and his professors must talk over due to the demands of travel for competition.</p>\n<p>“Not many athletes come out of this department so it’s kind of new for [professors]. Kind of every quarter, I need to talk to teachers right away and let them know my situation,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>This upcoming summer, Boswell will intern with Chevron in Los Angeles in a major step towards achieving his eventual goal of working in an oil field.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it will be great for me because I love learning about the thermodynamics side of stuff and fluid mechanics, and you put that together and you get working in an oil field,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Boswell will exhaust his eligibility for basketball after this season, but will return to UCSB next year to complete his degree without the athlete title. Needless to say, academics should be a piece of cake for Boswell next year without the extra demand of collegiate athletics.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that I could have only dreamed about. You don’t get this many opportunities in life where you’re exposed to such a high caliber education and at the same time you’re playing at the highest collegiate level of basketball,” Boswell said. “UCSB is a paradise and I couldn’t ask for anything more out of the school.”</p>\n<p>Boswell and the rest of the UCSB men’s basketball team host UC Riverside tomorrow at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of Feb. 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/","id":538,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[537,536,535],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Northridge for First Time Since 1984","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos fall to the Matadors 78-54.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>College basketball is a 40 minute game.

Northridge improves to 13-13 overall and 9-3 in conference.</p>\n<p>From the tip, Mitchell went with a small lineup, which was successful Thursday against Long Beach State. Instead, UCSB paid the price on the boards, losing the rebounding battle 55-28. CSUN also destroyed Santa Barbara in second chance points at 26-9.</p>\n<p>“They kicked our butts is what they did,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “(Junior center) Camille Mahlknecht on her own had (almost) as many rebounds as we had as a team. Our lack of block outs led to 26 second chance points and that’s the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Leading Northridge was Mahlknecht. While she averages just 7.7 points and 7.7 rebounds on the year, she was the thorn in the Gauchos’ side, recording a season-high 21 points, a program record and career-high 22 rebounds and five blocks on a career-high 10 made field goals.</p>\n<p>“We took all switches one through five, but I don’t think that was the issue. When we look at it, I think a lot of it will be high-low hits against our biggest post players,” Mitchell said. “That’s a mentality. She’s a good player, but she plays with a lot of heart and she understands her role. A lot of plays aren’t being run through her with the three great guards they have, so she’s finding a way to dictate the outcome of the game by getting rebounds and putbacks.”</p>\n<p>The Matadors started the game right where they left off when they beat Cal Poly 83-57 Thursday. Against the Mustangs, Northridge went 11-22 from three point range. With Santa Barbara down 4-7 in the first half, Northridge went on a 10-0 run, starting the game 3-5 from downtown and shooting 66.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>After Northridge’s lead reached its largest of the half at 19 points, Santa Barbara came alive. Fueled by the three Gaucho seniors, the team went on a 12-2 run to cut the lead to nine. Several times in the second half, UCSB came within nine, but could never get the needed play to break the barrier.</p>\n<p>With just less than eight minutes remaining at the lead at that same nine point lead, the Matadors closed the door they had been leaving open for UCSB, going on a 19-6 run to finish the game.</p>\n<p>“I remember we missed a couple easy shots,” Mitchell said. “That’s going to happen in the game of basketball, but at the end of the day, you need to sprint back and say, ‘okay, well now let’s get a stop.’ That’s the only way if things aren’t flowing smoothly on the offensive end is that you have to buckle down and get stops. We didn’t.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Zornig led the team offensively with her first double-double of her career, tallying 21 points and a career high 11 rebounds. She shot 8-18 from the field, including 4-6 from behind the arc. Nesbit also added 14 points for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Mel is so consistent. I don’t know if she knows she’s near 1,000 points or not, but at the end of the day, she’s getting after it,” Mitchell said. “She’s doing it on both ends of the floor, but she’s carrying too much of the burden. We have to have other players willing to join her.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their three-game road trip next week when they travel to UC Riverside Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear int he print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54048\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54048\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/","id":536,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[535,534,533],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Returns to Form Against Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos blow out the 49ers 80-69","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team entered yesterday’s game against Long Beach with a 1-7 Big West record.

On the very first possession, Zornig dove on the floor, earning the jump ball call. She drained a three on the other end to give Santa Barbara a 3-0 lead and from there, UCSB never looked back.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos jumped out to an 11-0 lead, allowing Long Beach just two shots and forcing six turnovers in the first three minutes. The 49ers remained scoreless until the 16:37 mark.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch told us before the game that we’re 0-0 going into this game and not to worry about our record,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We brought energy this game. In the first half, we set the tone and kept it up most of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB stretched its lead to 21 points less than 60 seconds into the second half, its largest lead of the game, and coasted to the easy victory. With the win, UCSB improves to 7-15 overall and 2-7 in conference. Long Beach drops to 13-11 overall and 5-5 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Like the Gaucho squad from earlier this season, Santa Barbara used its defense to fuel its offense. UCSB hassled Long Beach defensively, forcing 18 of the 49ers 22 turnovers in the pivotal first half.  They even gave Long Beach a taste of their own medicine, winning the steals battle 9-2 against the Big West’s best team in picking their opponent’s pocket.</p>\n<p>The turnovers allowed the Gauchos to turn to their best offense, pushing in transition. UCSB scored 22 points off Long Beach’s turnovers and outscored the 49ers 32-10 in the paint. They also outscored the 49ers in second chance points 17-6.</p>\n<p>“[The transition game] was huge,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We love to run. I mean, who doesn’t? When we get out and run, we know it’s going to be our best offense and it’s just fun.”</p>\n<p>For the first time during Mitchell’s rein, five players finished in double-figures for Santa Barbara. Zornig led the team with 18 points and seven rebounds, but it was a true team effort as all five starters had solid evenings.</p>\n<p>“I’m smiling, especially with the assist to turnovers and the fact that we attacked and got to the free throw line,” Mitchell said. “We just have to continue to grow and get better. We’ll test ourselves on Saturday and see if we can go two games back to back.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope to ride their momentum Saturday when they travel to Cal State Northridge. Tip-off is set for 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54041\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54041\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/","id":534,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[533,532,531],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go For Fourth Straight Victory at Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Mens_.Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt-1.30.2014.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Mens_.Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt-1.30.2014.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has already defeated Long Beach State this season and will attempt to sweep the season series Thursday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Exactly at the halfway point of conference play, the UCSB men’s basketball team has often looked like the best team in the Big West.

Despite committing 19 turnovers (compared to the 49ers’ seven), the Gauchos managed to hold Long Beach to under 30 percent shooting on the night and an even worse 19 percent in three-pointers.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure it’s going to be a lot tougher to play there because I would bet money that they shoot a whole lot better [tonight] than they did at our place,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They’ve won five of their last six in league and they’ve been a very formidable team.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s leading scorer and assist man in junior point guard Mike Caffey led the team with 21 points last time against UCSB, but was the only player to score in double figures. Junior guard Tyler Lamb, who averages over 15 points per game, was held to five points on a dreadful 1-13 shooting in the loss.</p>\n<p>“That’s what our goal is, to execute our defense the way we need to and make them take the shots we want them to take,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “I doubt they’re going to shoot as poorly as they did at our house.”</p>\n<p>Bryson led the Gauchos with 13 points against Long Beach in January and has lifted UCSB in recent games, scoring 18 in last week’s victory over Hawaii. The athletic wing player ranks third on the team with just under 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>“He’s regained his shooting form and he’s playing very physical and rebounding and playing tough,” Coach Williams said. “He’s a key ingredient for us. He’s one of those versatile pieces that allows us to play several different sizes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game off three straight victories, the fourth such time this season. The Gauchos have yet to win four straight, however, and will look to do so against a Long Beach team that will have the crowd on its side.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really tough environment, it’s a great home crowd. They’ll have it sold out, it’ll be rocking,” Coach Williams said. “They’ve made basketball a real priority there and you can tell by their home attendance that it’s something that they’ve put a lot into as a whole school.”</p>\n<p>Leading the charge in the hostile environment will be Big Al who ranks eighth in the country in points per game and fourth in rebounds. Williams leads the Big West in points and rebounds, is second in blocks and ranks seventh in field goal percentage and steals.</p>\n<p>“Al has had a superior year, he’s been absolutely spectacular. He brings it night in and night out and I think he’s getting better,” Coach Williams said. “His conditioning looks better, his confidence in shooting the ball from the perimeter is getting better — he’s improving in every way.”</p>\n<p>While things are certainly looking good for the Gauchos as a program, the team received devastating news that sophomore guard John Green will miss the rest of the season with a fractured wrist. Green previously missed the past two seasons with foot injuries, and after finally playing in his first regular season game as a Gaucho this season, will miss a third consecutive year to injury.</p>\n<p>“It sucks. It’s a really sad and unfortunate and unlucky kind of situation. John is the strongest guy that I know and I know he’ll get through it,” Big Al said. “We’ll consistently pray for him and maintain our faith. He’s going through a lot right now but his spirits are up and this team is picking him up. I just can’t wait until he finally gets back out there on the court.”</p>\n<p>Now with even more motivation to play for their fallen teammate, the Gauchos will certainly be ready for the task against a Long Beach program that has consistently battled UCSB atop the Big West standings in recent years.</p>\n<p>“We think it’s going to be a pretty hostile place. It always is,” Big Al said. “It’s always a big game between us two and their fans really show up and make a lot of noise. They’re going to be out there hungry for a win so it should be a good environment.”</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Long Beach State at the Walter Pyramid tonight for a 7 p.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 13, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54014\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54014\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/","id":533,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[532,531,530],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Long Beach State Amid Slump","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-bballvsnorthridge_annakodelashvili_1.18.14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-bballvsnorthridge_annakodelashvili_1.18.14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on conference contending Long Beach State at home Thursday night.

However, Santa Barbara made critical errors to open the second half, playing into the hands of the 49ers, who currently lead the Big West in steals with 10.5 per game. While the Gauchos lead the league in turnovers with just over 14 per game, Santa Barbara committed 20 turnovers in Long Beach, including six in the first six minutes of the second half.</p>\n<p>“You have to handle their changing defenses; I think that’s number one because they mix it up all night long,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t have the attack mentality. We can’t stand back on our heels. We have to go from tip, and let them know that changing defenses can’t affect us.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers were the clear aggressors throughout as they shot 21-27 from the free throw line, compared to 7-8 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I took it really personally,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I got emotional because we lost to them by 20. Now, it’s time for payback. With each team, it’s payback.”</p>\n<p>One bright spot on the evening was the play of Mason, who nearly recorded a double-double with 17 points and nine rebounds. One of three seniors anchoring the UCSB squad this season, Mason, senior guard Nicole Nesbit and senior guard Melissa Zornig account for 63.4 percent of the team’s points.</p>\n<p>“Nothing’s different. I’m not going into [the game] saying, ‘I’m going to score 24 points,’” Mason said. “I’m just going to take good shots, and be in a good rhythm. You know you’ve done it before, you can always do it again.”</p>\n<p>As for the 49ers, Long Beach ranks third in the conference in scoring, putting an average of 71 points on the scoreboard. The 49ers are a team known for playing through their guards and have a multitude of players who can step up any given night.</p>\n<p>While Long Beach has no players in the top 10 in scoring in the Big West, the team is led by freshman guard Raven Benton, who averages 13.6 points per game. Yet, in the first meeting, it was junior guard Lauren Spargo who put the team on her shoulders, tying her career-high with 19 points. She averages 10.1 points per game while junior guard and Big West honorable mention Alex Sanchez, who was a non-factor in the first match-up, averages 10.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They’re very blue-collar and there will be a mismatch problem at times, especially if they go with two power forwards,” Mitchell said. “We’re going to go small, and make them have to make the adjustments on the defensive end.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 14, 2014’s print edition of  </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Kodelashvili of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-state-amid-slump/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-state-amid-slump/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-state-amid-slump/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-state-amid-slump/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-state-amid-slump/","id":566,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[565,564,563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes Down Hawaii in Honolulu","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos defeat Hawaii 75-64","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On its longest road trip of the season, the UCSB men’s basketball team defeated Hawaii 75-64 in a come-from-behind fashion Thursday to remain near the top of the Big West standings.

Hawaii closed the deficit to three midway through the second half, but would never get any closer as the Gauchos slowly pulled away late in the game.</p>\n<p>With just under four minutes remaining and the Gauchos leading by six, Bryson took the game over, making a pair of free throws and three-point baskets to score eight of the final 10 points for UCSB and close out the game. Bryson finished the game with 18 points, second most in the contest of any player.</p>\n<p>Per As usual, junior center Alan Williams led UCSB by posting his 10th double-double of the season with 20 points and 17 rebounds. The reigning Big West Player of the Week ranks seventh in the nation in scoring (23.1 ppg) and is third in rebounds per game (11.4 rpg). In addition, Big Al tallied five blocked shots and ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taran Brown finished the game with 13 points, 10 coming in the first half alone. Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon scored all 10 of his points in the second half on an efficient 4-5 shooting night.</p>\n<p>A pair of forwards in sophomore Isaac Fotu and senior Christian Standhardinger led Hawaii. Fotu finished the game with 17 points and eight rebounds, while Standhardinger totaled 15 points and nine boards.</p>\n<p>With the rebounding and turnover margins relatively similar, this game came down to the shooting of both teams. The Gauchos were 8-22 shooting from beyond the arc compared to just 3-19 for the Rainbow Warriors and made the same amount of field goals despite 11 fewer shot attempts.</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/","id":561,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[560,559,558],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Struggling Gauchos Host Hawaii Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-070.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-070.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB tries to rebound from a three-game losing streak","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Losing seven of its last eight games, the UCSB women’s basketball team is ready to start anew and begin the second round of Big West play.

Even on the offensive side, that helped us because we were able to play a little more physical. I’ll be interested to see if we can play two small guards at the same time with [Onome and Nicole.]”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine essentially play four power forwards and a point guard, so while they don’t have incredible height like the Gauchos have seen in the past, they are a bigger team overall and play an extremely physical game.</p>\n<p>“They’re physical, so it’s not just going to be a test on the basketball side of it, but it’s a physical test and a mental test because they beat you up,” Mitchell said. “We will have to be ready to play blue-collar basketball.”</p>\n<p>The biggest target for Hawaii on offense will be senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who is a force down low despite the fact that she stands at just 5’11’’. She ranks sixth in the Big West in points at 15.8 per game, third in field goal percentage at 51.7 percent and third in rebounding, grabbing 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“She’s a beast. We’ve talked about getting in front of her because if she catches it, you’re done,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware said. “We have to box her out, so we’re going to try to contain her on that end of scoring and boxing her out because she gets a lot of their rebounds. She’s averaging a double-double.”</p>\n<p>Jackson will address the Gauchos’ biggest weakness because all season long, Santa Barbara has struggled with consistency, especially on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>In its last two games against UC Irvine and UC Davis, UCSB has played well in the first half and remained in contention at halftime, but then fallen apart in the second half, falling prey to defensive breakdowns. Against the Aggies, the Gauchos gave up a fatal 47 points in the second, compared to 35 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“Both games were close at one point and we let them get away from us,” Watkins said. “I think the biggest lesson we learned is that we have to put two halves together.”</p>\n<p>One of those defensive breakdowns has been failing to rebound in critical moments. Rebounding makes all the difference for Santa Barbara, which averages 40.7 boards per game in victories and 31 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be physical,” Watkins said. “We haven’t rebounded as well as coach would’ve liked this season so far, but we’re looking to turn our season around and it starts with rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Although the focus won’t be on offense tonight as UCSB hasn’t struggled nearly as much on that end of the floor, Hawaii is a great defensive team. The Rainbow Wahine top the conference in scoring defense, holding teams to 65.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for our kids’ mindsets is that they play majority man defense,” Mitchell said. “They can take a lot of switches because they’re basically all the same size, so we just have to make the right reads out of that. We have to trust and make the extra pass.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/","id":563,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[562,561,560],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":31,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
