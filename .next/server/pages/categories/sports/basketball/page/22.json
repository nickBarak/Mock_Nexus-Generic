While it hasn’t been the hottest start to the season for Williams and his team, Saturday’s big win could potentially signal a turning point for the Gauchos who currently stand among the middle of the pack with a record of 9-11 overall and 3-4 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After helping UCSB hand the Anteaters their first loss in conference play, Williams expects the skilled play of wing guards Eric Childress and T.J. Taylor to translate over to this week’s match.</p>\n<p>Childress has found his niche as the floor general for UCSB after taking over for former senior and starting point guard Zalmico Harmon. The junior from Hawthorne is among the top guards in the Big West in shooting ability and ball handing, leading the conference in three-point percentage at 51.2 percent and ranking third with an average of 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>“The play of Eric has steadily grown throughout the year,” Williams said. “He’s played exceptionally well this last month having one of the best assist-to-turnover ratios on the West coast and shooting from over 50 percent beyond the arc.” [Eric] is really making strides as a player, leader, and helping run the show for us so I’m really proud of him,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>The development of Childress has been evident this year and as of recently he has averaged a total to 10 ppg in the team’s last five contests.</p>\n<p>For Taylor, the senior guard is embracing his role as the sixth man for UCSB. Following a six-game drought without scoring a basket, Williams believes Taylor’s eight point outing on Saturday will open up more opportunities for him as he continues to play quality minutes behind Childress.</p>\n<p>“T.J. hasn’t really had any real opportunities [these past couple of games], but for him to snap out of it and hit a couple big shots was a real spark plug,” Williams said. “He is beloved by this team and to have him step up and contribute was special.”</p>\n<p>It’s been a steady incline for the 5-9” Oakland guard after sitting out the entire 2013-2014 season with a medical redshirt. As his minutes increase, Taylor’s shooting ability will likely draw opponents and leave the floor open for guards Gabe Vincent and Michael Bryson.</p>\n<p>As for first-year Head Coach Eran Ganot and the Warriors, Thursday will also be a defining moment within their conference schedule after having their seven-game winning streak snapped at home by senior guard Nick Faust and the Long Beach State 49ers.</p>\n<p>Hawaii fell to the ‘Beach’ 78-64 last Saturday as Faust erupted for 28 points on 5-8 shooting from downtown. With hopes of bouncing back from the loss, Ganot will likely utilize his deep rotation of guards in Thursday’s matchup by running the team’s offensive sets through All-Big West players Roderick Bobbitt and Aaron Valdes.</p>\n<p>The two guards have been the offensive anchors for the Warriors combining for a total of nine 20-plus point outings this season. The only duo to exceed that this year are UC Riverside’s own Taylor Johns and Jaylen Bland leading the conference with 14 20-plus scoring performances.</p>\n<p>Third year forward Mike Thomas looks to have a strong presence on the road as well finishing with a career-high 20 points in last week’s loss to Long Beach. The junior has been a mismatch against bigs down low using his speedy 6’7” frame to slash by defenders and finish at the rim. Thomas went 7-11 from the field on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its home stand against Hawaii this Thursday, Feb. 4 at 7 p.m. The Gauchos will also welcome Cal State Fullerton to the Thunderdome on Saturday, Feb. 6 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Since then, the losing woes have continued for Fullerton as it is 2-19 overall, 0-7 in the Big West and recently matched its school single-season record of 19 consecutive losses in a 79-52 loss at CSUN.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are not in the predicament of a must-win game this Wednesday, it is a matchup that could help them regain some momentum entering the middle portion of their conference schedule.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off its worst field goal percentage (31.1 percent) and lowest point total (51) in a conference game this season, it can be assured that UCSB is looking to recoup on the offensive end of the court.</p>\n<p>Prior to its recent losses, the Gauchos were on a three-game winning streak, shooting 43 percent from the field and averaged 65.3 points per game. While these aren’t groundbreaking statistics, UCSB’s decrease in turnovers helped it to establish a rhythmic flow on offense. It had recorded less turnovers than its opponents on three-straight occasions.</p>\n<p>Yet, a slow upward trend in turnovers has affected the Gauchos in their two losses. UCSB hadn’t registered over 14 turnovers since its first meeting at UCR, ending this streak with 16 at UCR and 17 at UCD.</p>\n<p>The rise in turnovers can be viewed as a warning signal for a team that once averaged 20 turnovers per game during its non-conference schedule. While the Gauchos have improved in their protection of the ball since the start of Big West play, UCSB’s battle with turnovers begins in its backcourt.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and sophomore guard Makala Roper both rank top 10 in the Big West in turnovers per game with overall averages of 3.3 and 4.2. However, the Gauchos’ average of 15.1 assists per game ranks third in the Big West in addition to them being second in steals per game with 8.9 per contest.</p>\n<p>In spite of the turnovers, Roper has been the driving force for the Gauchos’ scoring this season as she leads UCSB with a 12.5 points per game average. She also holds a fifth place ranking in the Big West in three-point percentage at 36.3 percent while her total of 41 three-pointers made this season is just five away from the conference lead. Freshman Coco Miller is just seven threes away from the conference lead of 46 with a total of 39 made perimeter shots on the year.</p>\n<p>Not known much as a scorer but rather as a floor general for the Gauchos’ offense, Jemerigbe has emerged with back-to-back games of double-figures in points despite the team’s pair of losses. She notched a career-high 16 points at UCR and had 15 points in the team’s loss at UCD.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held Fullerton to a 32.7 field goal percentage in its first matchup against the Titans. It was the Gauchos’ defense that influenced their offense as they scored 20 points off 15 Fullerton turnovers.</p>\n<p>CSUF will be hoping for an improved performance by forward Michelle Berry after a 6-23 shooting night in the team’s first game against the Gauchos. Though the first-year player concluded the game with a double-double of 14 points and 11 rebounds, Berry was responsible for seven of the Titans’ turnovers.</p>\n<p>The latest addition of junior center Dhanyel Johnson to its starting lineup may help reduce the team’s dependence on Berry for the remainder of the season. After a zero-point outing in 15 minutes of play in her first start of the season at Hawaii, Johnson took advantage of her 37 minutes this past Saturday at CSUN achieving her first career double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Junior center Je Zhe Newton scored a season-high 15 points in the Gauchos’ first bout against Fullerton, but had missed the last two of UCSB’s three games recently making a return at UCD in which she recorded seven points and five rebounds in 16 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton is set for Wednesday, Feb. 3 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/","id":365,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[364,363,362],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Cold Shooting Start Allows UCD to Prevail for 80-51 Rout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-8-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-8-of-13-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-12 shooting performance in the first quarter by the UCSB women's basketball team resulted in the Gauchos falling behind 22-8 and eventually ended in a 80-51 victory for UC Davis as the Aggies shot...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>While the UCSB women’s basketball team managed to defeat UC Davis 66-59 last Thursday despite a 12.5 field goal percentage in the first quarter, the Gauchos’ 3-12 shooting performance in the first period of Saturday’s contest resulted in them being outscored 22-8.

Completing the Aggies’ consistent shooting performance was their success from behind the three-point line, finishing 9-17 from long range.</p>\n<p>Attempting 10 of Davis’ 17 shots from beyond the arc were two of the Big West’s top three-point shooters in forwards senior Pele Gianotti and sophomore Celia Marfone.</p>\n<p>After earning her first career double-double against the Gauchos earlier this season, Gianotti provided another solid performance tallying a game-high 18 points on 7-10 shooting from the field, 4-7 from three-point range in addition to five rebounds, three assists and three steals. Marfone finished with 17 points on 7-12 shooting while going 2-3 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Supporting Davis’ assertive scoring start was its effort on defense as it held the Gauchos to eight points in the first quarter, nearly repeating its allowance of seven points to UCSB in the first period of last Thursday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ off shooting performance affected their leading scorer in sophomore guard Makala Roper as she went 4-14 from the field to conclude Saturday with 10 points, five rebounds and five assists. Yet, providing UCSB with scoring was backcourt leader Onome Jemerigbe. After a career-high 16 points at UC Riverside, the junior point guard followed up with a team-high 15 points as the Gauchos attempted to overcome their out of sync shooting.</p>\n<p>But, the Aggies sustained their lead with Marfone at the forefront of their 24-12 outscoring of UCSB in the second quarter. Her 12-point scoring outburst in the quarter helped guide UCD to its 46-20 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s shooting slump was most evident from the insufficient 14 minutes of play that senior guard Jasmine Ware displayed while on the court. After a career-high 23 points at UCR, her nine-game streak of double-figures in points came to an end as she went scoreless on a 0-3 overall and 0-2 three-point shooting effort while committing four turnovers, adding to the Gauchos’ total of 17.</p>\n<p>There was a more even exchange of points in the second half as the Aggies narrowly outscored UCSB 34-31 in the final two quarters. Still, it wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which UCSB shot over 40 percent from the field (42.9 percent) but could not supersede the Aggies’ 50 percent shooting in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara’s best shooting stretch occurred in the fourth quarter, the Gauchos already faced a 18-point deficit entering the period and were eventually defeated 80-51.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home to face Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday and Hawaii on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67817\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/gauchos-cold-shooting-start-allows-ucd-to-prevail-for-80-51-rout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67817\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/gauchos-cold-shooting-start-allows-ucd-to-prevail-for-80-51-rout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/gauchos-cold-shooting-start-allows-ucd-to-prevail-for-80-51-rout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/gauchos-cold-shooting-start-allows-ucd-to-prevail-for-80-51-rout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/gauchos-cold-shooting-start-allows-ucd-to-prevail-for-80-51-rout/","id":364,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[363,362,361],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to UC Davis for Rematch With Aggies this Satuday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 92-81 loss at UC Riverside ended the UCSB women's basketball team's winning stretch of three consecutive games.

UC Davis regained its second place standing in the conference as a result of UCSB’s loss and with a 75-57 victory over Cal Poly. The Aggies will host Santa Barbara with records of 11-7 and 4-1 in Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Prior to the start of conference play, the Gauchos’ identity as a team was a questionable matter heading into the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>However, through six Big West games, UCSB’s identity continues to gradually build around its improvements on offense. Santa Barbara has nearly improved in every statistical category since the beginning of conference play. UCSB currently ranks third in the conference in field goal percentage at 45.8, fourth in points per game with an average of 68.0 and fifth in three-point percentage at 35.5.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara has improved offensively, its prowess on defense has turned into a source of scoring as the Gauchos’ average of 9.2 steals per game ranks second in the Big West. As UCSB has forced opponents to turn the ball over, it has influenced the flow of ball movement in UCSB’s offense and will be a vital asset in the Gauchos containing the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes you just think execution is on the offensive end, but it’s on the defensive end as well,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Their [UC Davis] guards will try to post us because we’re a lot smaller. For us to try to pressure the post on a pass will be important for us.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, UCSB averages 16.0 assists per game, ranking third in the Big West. Leading UCSB’s passing attack has been junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She ranks second in assists per game, nearly doubling her average since the start of conference play improving from 3.9 to 6.7 per contest. She posted a career-high 10 assists in the first meeting versus the Aggies as she dished dimes to teammates like sophomore guard Makala Roper who scored a game-high 26 points in the victory.</p>\n<p>“As a point guard, you’re always kind of held at a different level and Coach Bonnie has made that clear,” Jemerigbe said. “She’s been pushing me and every time she pushes me I get better. My teammates help me of course, without them knocking down the shots, I don’t get the assists.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s defense has been a disruption in the passing lanes for opponents, the Gauchos’ quick hands will not always make up for their size disadvantage. It is a drawback that has affected their performance when rebounding the ball, landing UCSB with a conference low average of 30.3 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Although Davis grabbed just seven more rebounds than UCSB in the first meeting, outrebounding the Gauchos 40-33, the Aggies’ ability to rebound the ball is essential to capitalizing on their size.</p>\n<p>Davis’ length provides a versatile element which goes beyond it being a threat in the paint. It is also the reason the Aggies have been such a lethal team when shooting the ball from beyond the arc in being able to rebound the ball and make the passes to set up perimeter shots.</p>\n<p>Their 39.5 three-point field goal percentage leads the Big West as senior forward Celia Marfone and sophomore forward Pele Gianotti are the Aggies’ top sharpshooters from long range. Both rank in the top five of the conference in three-point field goal percentage with Marfone owning a Big West leading 49 percent and Gianotti in second at 40.7 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Gianotti registered her first career double-double in Davis’ loss to UCSB, tallying 19 points and 10 rebounds. Her dual-threat ability to shoot from behind the perimeter and score in the post in the ideal complement to redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch.</p>\n<p>Bertsch is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 13.1 ppg in addition to her conference leading 58.1 field goal percentage which ranks 12<sup>th</sup> in the nation. As a team, Davis holds national rankings in field goal percentage (43.9 percent) and field goal percentage defense (36.3 percent), ranking 41<sup>st</sup> and 45<sup>th</sup> in the country along with ranking second in the conference in both statistical categories, respectively.</p>\n<p>UCD held UCSB to just seven points in the first quarter of last week’s contest. Yet, both teams registered first half field goal percentages below 30 percent in the initial meeting.</p>\n<p>“We always say don’t have amnesia,” Henrickson said. “The rules on offense are: drive it, shoot it, but don’t hold it. When things work, keep doing it and when things don’t work, quit doing it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tipoff at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 30 in the Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67617\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67617\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/","id":363,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[362,361,360],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Capitalize on Momentous Win, Face LBSU Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-30-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-30-web.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"In the middle of the pack in the Big West standings at fourth place, the UCSB men's basketball team has an opportunity to even out its 2-3 conference record in its matchup against Long Beach State ton...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off a big 74-61 win over Cal State Northridge on Saturday, the UCSB men’s basketball team heads on the road hoping to continue its momentum tonight against Long Beach State.

They eventually went on to snag the much-needed win, their only victory in a three-game home stand.</p>\n<p>Against Long Beach in the prior game, UCSB bounced back from a miserable 23 point first half to put up 44 in the final 20 minutes, making a run reducing a 15 point lead to just six before coming up just short. Senior guard Michael Bryson scored a team-high 23 points on 10-16 shooting in that game and currently leads the Big West with 18.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>The 49ers were led by Bibbins in that game, whose performance was called “sensational” by UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams. The 5’8” guard torched the Gauchos for 25 points on 8-12 shooting including 5-5 from three-point range, putting in a dagger layup with 2:11 to go that ended all hopes of a UCSB comeback. He leads his team with 5.3 assists per game and averages 11.4 ppg for the year.</p>\n<p>More offensive balance would be huge for a Gaucho team that has struggled to score, averaging a second-worst mark of 65.2 ppg as a team since the beginning of conference play.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, they have made a second-best 38.2 percent from three during that same stretch, suggesting they may need to rely more on their outside shooting.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Gabe Vincent has been UCSB’s top threat from deep since finding his shot in recent weeks. He ranks second in three-pointers made since the beginning of conference, making 18-42 for a 42.9 percent mark.</p>\n<p>Getting center Sam Beeler more involved deep in the paint could also prove beneficial for the Gauchos, as the 6’10” senior leads the conference by a mile with a 74.4 shooting percentage. He is coming off a perfect 12-point, 6-6 shooting night against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Other than Bibbins, the 49ers only other double-digit scorer is Nick Faust, who puts up 15.5 points and 5.5 rebounds a night. The senior guard played three seasons at Maryland, where he was one of the Terrapins’ key contributors and was named to the All-ACC Freshman team. He transferred to Long Beach in 2014 before sitting out an NCAA-mandated redshirt season last year.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will tipoff at 7:30 p.m. at Walter Pyramid in Long Beach and will be shown on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/","id":358,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[357,356,355],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Three-Game Streak Ends in 92-81 Loss at UCR, 4-2 in Big West Standings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-5-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With first-place in the Big West standings on the line, the UCSB women's basketball team was unable to extend its three-game winning streak after a 92-81 loss to UC Riverside on Saturday.

Yet, the Highlanders dominated the paint by outrebounding UCSB 36-19, a season-low for UCSB, and outscored the Gauchos in the paint 44-30.</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders’ interior offense was Rejane Verin. The redshirt junior forward justified her third selection as Big West Player of the Week nearly finishing with a triple-double. Verin registered a game-high 25 points, 16 rebounds and led UCR in assists with seven.</p>\n<p>Four of the Highlanders’ starters finished with double-figures in scoring. In addition to Verin and Curry, senior guards Brittany Crain and Annelise Ito added to UCR nearly matching its season-high of 93 points. Despite just six points in the first half, Crain ended with 23 points while Ito notched 17 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>Riverside’s control of the post became even more advantageous in getting to the free-throw line in which it finished 23-25. UCSB was efficient at the free-throw line as well, but had less attempts making 13-16.</p>\n<p>UCR finished with 10 free-throw attempts in the first quarter, but it was the early production of 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year Michelle Curry that helped the Highlanders gain a double-figure lead. She scored nine of her 15 total points in the opening quarter, making half of the Highlanders’ free-throw attempts as Riverside took an 18-8 lead.</p>\n<p>Ware helped UCSB rally from its 10-point deficit, scoring the Gauchos’ last two field goals from beyond the arc to trim UCR’s lead to 26-21 to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>Neither team could score a basket to open the second quarter as the two registered just one field goal apiece through nearly four minutes of play. Yet, the scoring outburst of Jemerigbe and freshman guard Coco Miller helped UCSB stay within a close margin of the Highlanders’ lead.</p>\n<p>The two accounted for eight of Santa Barbara’s last nine field goals, combining for 16 of the Gauchos’ total of 20 points in the quarter on 7-10 shooting from the field. Miller concluded Saturday’s contest with 18 points while shooting 7-15, 4-10 from behind the three-point line to go along with two steals. Still, UCSB entered halftime down 41-47.</p>\n<p>Riverside increased its lead to 10 in the early minutes of the second half. But a 9-2 UCSB run brought the Gauchos within three at 50-53, forcing a UCR timeout. Santa Barbara came as close as a one-point deficit at 56-57, but could not prevent UCR’s 12-2 run to close out the third quarter with a 69-58 lead.</p>\n<p>After a made free-throw by junior forward Inara Nyingifa, UCR earned its largest lead of 17 points at 78-61. A total of 10 points from Ware helped UCSB in its comeback attempts as a three-pointer by Miller with 4:08 remaining in regulation trimmed the Gauchos’ deficit to seven at 73-80.</p>\n<p>However, the scoring duo of Crain and Verin helped UCR secure its victory as the two combined for 18 points and three steals helping lead the Highlanders to their 92-81 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its road stint with a game at UC Davis on Saturday, Jan. 30 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/","id":356,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[355,354,353],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB with 66-59 Upset Victory over UC Davis Thursday Night, Rematch at UCR on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-12-of-13-e1453428581461.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-12-of-13-e1453428581461.jpg?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sophomore guard Makala Roper fell one point shy of her career-high in points, scoring 26 points in the UCSB women's basketball team's upset of UC Davis on Thursday.

Davis moved down to third-place in the standings after encountering its first conference loss which snapped its four-game winning streak making the Aggies 10-7 overall, 3-1 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>It was a low scoring start for both teams as the first basket did not occur until two minutes into play. The Gauchos shot 2-17 from the field in the first quarter as a three-pointer and layup by Roper were the team’s only field goals, prompting her total of 10 points in the first half. Davis shot 4-14 to open the game, but an 8-2 run helped it to take a 10-7 lead at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara managed to respond with an 8-2 run of its own in the early stages of the second quarter, going up 15-12. Still, in spite of scoring stretches from both offenses, neither could establish a consistent source of scoring finishing the first half with field goal percentages below 30 percent.</p>\n<p>Yet, after a 0-7 shooting effort in the first quarter, senior guard Jasmine Ware managed to gain her shooting rhythm with back-to-back jumpshots to set UCSB up with its 22-20 lead at halftime. She led the Gauchos’ bench in scoring with 15 points in addition to grabbing five rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Jas is playing the four now because we’re depleted a little bit,” Henrickson said. “She hits timely shots. I thought she was antsy to begin with, but had the big three at the end of the third quarter. She guards, rebounds, has phenomenal effort and a big heart. We feed off of her.”</p>\n<p>After a three-point make by Roper, Ware drained a shot from long distance on the Gauchos next possession to regain the team’s double-figure lead of 47-36 heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>It was a noticeable effort by the Aggies in the second half to attempt to capitalize on their size advantage in the paint after shooting 28 percent from the field and 22.2 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Davis found success in its plan to go down low, achieving a 53.3 field goal percentage in the second half. Leading the Aggies was sophomore forward Pele Gianotti with a double-double of 17 points and 10 rebounds. However, she would be the only Davis player to finish with double-figures in scoring as the Aggies were unable to overcome their deficit.</p>\n<p>Entering Thursday’s contest, UCSB was shooting just 29.2 percent from beyond the arc. Although the team couldn’t convert the three-point shot in the first half, Henrickson never doubted the Gauchos’ shot selection from deep as they went 7-12 from behind the three-point line in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We said that going into the year we would have to manufacture offense from the three-point line because we aren’t very big inside,” she explained. “A pretty good chunk of those [three-point shots] are pretty good shots in rhythm. We just talked about shot mechanics– footwork, be a ready shooter, you shouldn’t be surprised by somebody trying to drive and kick. They’re 3-15, [we] tell them shoot it, just shoot it with good footwork and shot mechanics because we can knock those down.”</p>\n<p>Five of the Gauchos’ seven three-point field goals in the second half occurred in the third quarter, a period in which UCSB outscored UC Davis 25-16.</p>\n<p>As freshman guard Coco Miller picked up two quick fouls in the first half, senior guard Dioseline Lopez provided an energetic spurt of offense in her 14 minutes off the bench. She finished the game with five points, went 2-2 from the field while her lone three-point make was the stimuli to the team’s momentous run in the third quarter. Also aiding the Gauchos’ run was junior forward Mi’Chael Wright. In 12 minutes of play, Wright concluded the night with five points, three rebounds and drew a crucial offensive charge on the defensive end of the court to sustain UCSB’s great play.</p>\n<p>“Those are big minutes of production from two kids who haven’t played a lot lately,” Henrickson said. “Give them credit for being mature enough and hanging in there. If you’re dialed in on the bench, you’ll get rewarded for that. Any kids that pout on the bench, watch what happens when they get in. They’re not ready to play, give those two kids credit for being ready to play.”</p>\n<p>After just 10 turnovers at CSUF and 12 against CSUN, the Gauchos continued their consistency when handling the ball with just 13 turnovers, one less than UCD’s 14 on Thursday. It is the third consecutive game in which UCSB has registered less turnovers than its opponent.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 23 to face the Highlanders at 7 p.m. in the SRC Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67572\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67572\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/","id":362,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[361,360,359],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Eyeing Upset vs. UC Davis Tonight, Face UCR Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-7-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-7-of-13-web.jpg?resize=402%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team hopes to continue its current two-game winning streak as it looks to end UC Davis' undefeated conference record (3-0).

Turnovers have afflicted the Gauchos in a majority of their games this season, however they showed signs of improvement with season-lows of 10 and 12 against Fullerton and Northridge, respectively.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara has reduced its amount of turnovers in its last two contests, its defense has pestered opponents as of late. UCSB forced 35 turnovers in its last two wins, helping it garner 36 points off turnovers. Accompanying UCSB’s stout defense has been the effort of its players off the bench as well.</p>\n<p>Despite being supplanted of her starting role after the team’s 71-69 loss at Pepperdine, Jasmine Ware has been a consistent scorer from the Gauchos’ group of reserves. The senior guard has notched double-figures in scoring for seven consecutive games and ranks second on the team with 9.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>The recent emergence of junior center Je zhe Newton has been an encouraging sign for the Gauchos’ scoring in the paint. She scored a season-high 15 points in the team’s first road victory at Fullerton and has tallied double-figures in three-straight games while her average of 5.2 rebounds per game leads the Gauchos as well.</p>\n<p>Yet, it will be UCSB’s defense which will encounter the most difficult task in having to contain Davis’ array of scoring options. Four players in the Aggies’ starting lineup average 10-plus ppg. Moreover, it has been an impressive first-year for forward Morgan Bertsch after redshirting last season. Her 13.9 ppg leads UC Davis as she earned her fifth 20-point game of the season in Davis’ conference opener win over UCI and possesses a conference-leading 59.6 conference field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Following Santa Barbara’s quick return home is its matchup against UC Riverside on Saturday. The Gauchos will look to avenge their lone conference defeat thus far after a 30-point, 83-53 loss to the Highlanders in the opening week of the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>UCR’s 4-0 conference start puts it within just one win away from its best Big West start since joining the conference.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have continued their dominance so far this season, ranking eighth in the nation in assists-to-turnover ratio with a 1.35 average. They also lead the Big West in ppg (82.4), assists per game (22.3), and average the least amount of turnovers per game (10.8).</p>\n<p>After setting a season-high 33-points in the first meeting, star-studded guard Brittany Crain will certainly be on UCSB’s defensive radar. A senior from Moreno Valley, CA, Crain’s average of 19.2 ppg leads the conference and ranks 33<sup>rd</sup> in the nation. She is just 48 points shy of becoming the seventh player in Big West history to reach a career total of 2,000 points.</p>\n<p>Complementing the play of Crain is redshirt junior forward Rejane Verin. Since sitting out last season due to redshirting, the UNLV transfer has had a breakout year. She ranks second on the team and in the Big West in scoring with 17.8 ppg. Her career-high 34-point performance in the Highlanders’ 78-60 victory over LBSU earned her third Big West Conference Player of the Week award. While her ability to penetrate and control the paint down is valuable to UCR’s offense, Verin’s precise and efficient passing skills may be more pivotal. She is second on the team in assists per game at 4.1 and recorded a game-high eight assists in the Highlanders win over UCSB two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Riverside is a quickly paced offense that likes to run the floor, but the Gauchos must hold their ground and stay committed to their strategy in hopes of avenging their loss on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip-off tonight at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome as its game at UCR on Saturday, Jan. 23 will begin at 7 p.m. as well in the SRC Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67554\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67554\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/","id":361,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[360,359,358],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sluggish First Half Drowns Gauchos At Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-24-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-24-web.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With their third loss out of four to open up Big West play, the Gauchos are in a bit of a hole to start the conference season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67479\" style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67479\" data-attachment-id=\"67479\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/eric-childress-peeks-towards-the-hoop-cameryn-brockdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-24-web.jpg?fit=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"401,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Childress peeks towards the hoop.

The 49ers cemented their current third-place position in the conference at 9-11 overall, 3-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was a rough game for us. Quite frankly we just didn’t come ready to play,” senior guard Michael Bryson said. “It’s kind of frustrating. I don’t know how many times we have to take a loss for us to respond.”</p>\n<p>In recent outings, UCSB has been at its worst late in the second half, especially in last Saturday’s 61-52 loss to UC Irvine when the it went scoreless for the final 10:50 at home. Last night’s game told a different story, as the 49ers got off to a quick 10-2 start out of the gate, including seven points from freshman forward Mason Riggins.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer from senior guard Michael Bryson with 10:07 left cut the lead to 12-9, but Long Beach responded with a 19-7 run and never looked back. The 49er lead was 36-23 the halftime break and never reached higher than 15 for the game, but every time momentum looked to be swinging toward UCSB, the Beach had an answer.</p>\n<p>“In the first half we came out a little slow, sluggish, lethargic, just not really energized and ready to play,” senior forward John Green said. “In the second half we were starting to click a little bit but it’s tough to get out of a hole when a team is making shots.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach guard Justin Bibbins was there to kill the Gauchos’ runs all night, going 5-5 on three-pointers for a game-high 25 points.</p>\n<p>“They hit open threes that we were giving them, they were attacking, really going at us, putting their shoulder down,” Bryson said. “They were the aggressor tonight and it shows. Once they took the lead they never gave it back.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson looked calm and collected on offense all night, scoring a UCSB-high 23 points. The conference’s leading scorer finished with an efficient 10-16 shooting night, including 3-6 on threes, before fouling out late in the game.</p>\n<p>After trailing for nearly the entire game, a late comeback gave the Gauchos hope that they could salvage a win despite a lethargic first half performance. Five straight points from senior forward John Green cut the lead to 69-61 with 4:55 remaining. Just 92 seconds later, a left-handed lay-in by Bryson cut it to 71-65, bringing UCSB the closest it had been since the 8:12 mark of the first half.</p>\n<p>From there, it was the 5’8” Bibbins who finished off Santa Barbara once and for all, scooping in a dagger layup with 2:11 remaining to give the 49ers a 10-point lead on their way to the 77-67 win.</p>\n<p>“The second half I recognized that group, but you can’t play 20 or 30 minutes, you’ve got to play 40 minutes,” Williams said. “Long Beach played well offensively and Bibbins was sensational, but when you can’t get stops, it’s really difficult to crawl back in a game.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach shot 50 percent for the night, taking advantage of poor UCSB defense by scoring relatively easy open shots off down screens and dribble penetration. The Gauchos shot 42.1 percent as a team for the game, but were a much different team in the second half, scoring 44 points compared to just 23 in the first.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to take some positives away from the loss. Its 17 free throw attempts were the most it has had in its last seven outings.</p>\n<p>“I did like how we competed the second half of the game,” Williams said. “We kept the pedal on, we kept attacking, we didn’t get our heads down, we kept aggressive the second half of the game.”</p>\n<p>The night also saw the return of Green, who missed the Gauchos’ last six games with a knee injury. Clearly not at 100 percent as he played with a brace, Green provided the Gauchos some much needed energy and offensive punch, recording 12 points and seven rebounds off the bench.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ improved second-half energy also saw them finish with a 38-28 rebounding advantage. Freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak led all players with eight boards.</p>\n<p>This Saturday, UCSB will play the last of its current three-game homestand against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67527\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67527\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/","id":360,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[359,358,357],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vincent’s Game-Winner Salvages Road Win at Cal Poly, but Gauchos Falter in Consecutive Second Halves","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team picked up its first conference win on the road against Cal Poly, but sputtered down the stretch in a home game against UC Irvine on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67425\" style=\"width: 258px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67425\" data-attachment-id=\"67425\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/looking-at-a-teammate-john-green-passes-the-ball-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Looking at a teammate, John Green passes the ball.

The Gauchos came through on the road against Cal Poly last Thursday, winning 76-73 thanks to a go-ahead layup by sophomore guard Gabe Vincent with 11 seconds left after losing a 15 point lead.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara fell apart in the second half for the second straight game, being held scoreless through the final 10:50 on the way to a 61-52 loss in its home conference opener.</p>\n<p>“We just wore out. We just got tired and it’s become apparent to me that it’s a problem,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve got leads or we’re right there in the last three or four minutes of games and we’ve got no pop. We look fatigued and the type of mistakes we were making were fatigue mistakes.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Out of the nine teams in the Big West, UCSB is one of six that currently has a record of 1-2 or worse in the conference. The Gauchos stand at 7-9 overall and 1-2 in conference play. The Mustangs share an identical record, putting both teams tied for the fifth best mark in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters, who were predicted to finish first in the Big West this season, sit atop the standings alongside Hawai’i at 15-5 overall, 4-0 conference. They are one of two teams in the Big West that is still undefeated through the opening two weeks of conference.</p>\n<p>Facing UC Irvine and college basketball’s most imposing inside force in sophomore center Mamadou Ndiaye on Saturday, the Gauchos knew they would need to be able to score from outside the paint in order to win. From very early on, they showed not only the willingness to take shots from deep, but the ability to make them.</p>\n<p>After falling behind 8-0 through less than three minutes of play, all points being scored by Irvine’s senior forward Mike Best, UCSB answered back with 15 consecutive points, hitting 5-7 three-pointers during the run to take a 15-8 lead by the 11:55 mark of the first half.</p>\n<p>That tactic didn’t change much before the first half buzzer, as the Gauchos, led by junior point guard Eric Childress, finished the first stanza knocking down 8-17 from deep, while shooting just 3-13 from inside the arc. Childress finished the half with 12 points on 4-4 shooting, all threes, to give UCSB a 30-28 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>The second half told a much different story as the Gauchos went away from the three-ball and were unable to match the Anteaters’ energy down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“We knew coming in we were going to have to make shots to beat this team because they’re so big inside the paint,” Childress said. “We knew we had to rely on the three, but at the end we should’ve got into the paint a little bit more so it hurt us towards the end.”</p>\n<p>A pair of highlight dunks from senior guard Michael Bryson helped keep momentum on the UCSB side as his side early in the second half. First, Childress found Bryson cutting down the baseline for a spectacular, left-handed slam that the Anteater defense could do nothing but watch, putting the Gauchos up 38-32 with 17:21 to go.</p>\n<p>Bryson followed that up just three minutes later, taking a perfect halfcourt lob from Childress over the heads of several defenders and finishing gracefully with a two-hand dunk to keep UCSB up 44-39.</p>\n<p>After Vincent hit his fourth three-pointer of the night to put his team up 52-44 with 10:50 to go, the Gaucho offense began to sputter and the Anteaters took over, taking a drastic advantage in the free-throw department.</p>\n<p>“We started not moving the ball around, settling with our looks that we were getting, not really sticking to our concepts and we just got rushed,” Bryson said. “Towards the end of the game we tightened up and didn’t do what we normally do, so we’ve got to learn from it and get ready for [this] week.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard Luke Nelson’s three-pointer out of a timeout with 3:51 left put the Anteaters up 54-52, giving them their first lead since the 15:37 mark in the first half. Nelson came back down the court less than a minute later to knock down a second consecutive jumper, and the Gauchos fell apart as they proceeded to turn the ball over on three of their next four possessions. Irvine ended the game on a 17-0 run, holding UCSB to 0-11 from the field, 0-4 from the foul line, and five turnovers over the final 10:50 seconds.</p>\n<p>“I wish we would have shot more [three-pointers] to be honest with you. If you can’t beat Mamadou at the rim, you’ve got to knock down some mid-range shots, no doubt, but you’ve also got to make some threes,” Williams said. “We didn’t shoot as many in the second half, and I think we would’ve been better off taking eight more threes in the second half than the bad shots we took.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot just 3-9 from three in the second half, making just 9-27 shots overall. They finished the game with just one made free throw on five attempts, compared to 14-22 from the line for Irvine in the second half alone. The Anteaters were 19-32 on free throws for the game.</p>\n<p>“The big disappointment is a lot of our fouls were shooting fouls, especially in the second half,” Williams said. “On the defensive side I think we did a good job on [Ndiaye]. We said we’d rather have him shoot free throws than get a dunk. The difference in the game was Mike Best.”</p>\n<p>For Irvine, Best’s hot start saw him end with a game-high 20 points on 8-13 shooting. Ndiaye was held to just 1-3 from the field and had just one block, but still managed to get to hurt UCSB, making 9-16 from the foul line to finish with 11 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, Vincent, Bryson and Childress were a combined 10-20 from three-point range, putting up marks of 14, 13 and 12 points, respectively, but simply didn’t have enough gas in the tank down the stretch to pull off a second consecutive win.</p>\n<p>“I think we need to want it more. It was coming easy to us the first half,” Bryson said. “When shots weren’t falling in the second half, we got lazy and weren’t doing the little things we needed to do to get a win. I don’t think we wanted it enough tonight.”</p>\n<p>Against Cal Poly two nights prior, the Gauchos had one of their better shooting first halves of the season, going 17-34 from the field to take a 43-38 lead into halftime on the road. Vincent was on fire in the first half, hitting five straight three-pointers as he headed into the break with a game-high 17 points on 6-10 shooting.</p>\n<p>UCSB held onto the lead for most of the second half, as a pair of free throws by Vincent made it 68-53 with 7:41 to go. However, the recent trend of the Gauchos falling apart late in games showed its head once again, as the Mustangs went on a furious rally. Senior forward Joel Awich’s three-pointer with 1:29 remaining put Cal Poly up 73-72, giving the Mustangs’ their first lead since the eight minute mark of the first half.</p>\n<p>With less than 20 seconds to go, Bryson drove through the middle before finding Vincent cutting down the left side, and Vincent finished with a strong layup while being fouled to put UCSB back up 74-73. A missed free throw gave Cal Poly a chance to win it at the other end, but senior guard David Nwaba missed the potential game-winning layup with seconds left.</p>\n<p>After a pair of made free throws by Childress, Cal Poly’s Ridge Shipley missed a three-pointer at the buzzer, giving the Gauchos a 76-73 victory and their first conference win of the season.</p>\n<p>Vincent finished as the hero with career-highs in points (27) and three-pointers made (7-11), while forward Sam Beeler came up big with 17 points and 12 rebounds on an efficient 8-9 shooting night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be back in action tomorrow as they face Long Beach State in the second of a three-game homestand. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/","id":359,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[358,357,356],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pick up First Road Win of Season, 3-1 in BW with Wins over CSUN & CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-13-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-13-of-13-web.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is no longer winless on the road this season after wins at Cal State Northridge and Cal State Fullerton over the weekend.

Santa Barbara’s 65-47 victory against the Titans was their first road win of the year. In addition, their 65-49 win over CSUN helped UCSB achieve back-to-back conference wins for the first time since the 2012-13 season.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-12, 3-1 in Big West action and has won five of its last six games. Northridge has now lost seven consecutive games, falling to 2-15 overall and 0-3 in conference play following losses to Hawaii and UCSB. Fullerton also sits at 2-15, 0-3 in the Big West after losses to UCSB and Cal Poly, extending its losing streak to 15 games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos’ ballhandling over the two games was most valuable as they finished with a season-low 10 against Fullerton to end their six-game streak of 20-plus turnovers. They followed this performance with a second-best total of 12 at CSUN.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 42.9 three-point percentage against the Matadors marked the third time over its six-game span in which it shot over 40 percent from beyond the arc. It was a shooting clinic for the Gauchos in the first quarter of Saturday’s game as they went 5-6 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>After an early 6-2 lead to open the quarter and an eventual 9-9 tie, the Matadors would go on to trail for the remainder of the game. The abundance of perimeter shots helped UCSB put together a 22-4 scoring run to close out the quarter with a 31-13 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four different Gauchos drained at least one three-point attempt during the run with freshman guard Coco Miller, going 2-2 from long range for her only three-point field goals of the game to finish with 12 points and tied her career-high in steals with a game-high five.</p>\n<p>Another one of those Gauchos was senior guard Jasmine Ware. In just 23 minutes of play, Ware scored a game-high 17 points off the bench on an 8-11 shooting effort to go along with three assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its run in the second quarter with a 7-2 scoring stretch to begin the quarter, forcing a Northridge timeout. CSUN’s 12-4 run led to it trailing 27-45 to enter halftime.</p>\n<p>Despite being down for the entirety of the game, CSUN’s advantage on the boards helped it to remain in the game. It outrebounded UCSB 40-31 as freshman center Channon Fluker recorded a game-high 15 rebounds and guard Cheyenne Allen finished with 11.</p>\n<p>The closest Northridge came within UCSB’s lead was a 12-point deficit of 42-54. Helping CSUN in its comeback attempt was junior guard Emily Cole. Responsible for two of the Matadors’ total of three perimeter shots in the game, Cole led the Matadors in scoring with 14 points.</p>\n<p>Still, CSUN’s edge on the glass would not be enough as UCSB’s consistent scoring offense ended with a 45.8 field goal percentage versus CSUN’s 35.8 shooting percentage. Along with Ware and Miller, sophomore guard Makala Roper (10) and junior center Je zhe Newton (11) finished with double-figures in scoring as UCSB secured its 65-49 victory.</p>\n<p>It was a solid outing for Newton after having her best performance of the season at Cal State Fullerton on Thursday. She set a season-high in scoring with 15 points against the Titans, tallying her third-straight game with double-figures. Newton also had seven rebounds and three blocks on the night.</p>\n<p>It was a quick start to the game by Fullerton, opening with a 5-0 scoring run for the lead. At the helm of the Titans’ swift start was freshman forward Michelle Berry and freshman guard Jade Vega. In spite of her inefficient shooting (6-23), Berry earned a double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds while Vega finished with 11 points.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB responded with a 5-0 run of its own to tie the game up. A 22-13 lead was the Gauchos’ largest lead of the first half, but CSUF persevered with an 8-0 run as UCSB managed to maintain a 26-24 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB held Fullerton to a 32.7 field goal percentage on the night. Most importantly, it limited the Titans’ three-point shot as they shot 27.8 percent from long range. The Gauchos’ defense enhanced their offense as they ended the game shooting 49 percent from the field. Notably, their 58.3 field goal percentage in the second half enabled them to take a substantial lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara outscored Fullerton 39-23 in the final two quarters of the game. It was a breakout half for Ware as she scored 11 of her 13 points in the latter portion of the game on 5-8 shooting. Roper made half of the Gauchos’ three-point field goals to finish with 13 points as well.</p>\n<p>Unable to establish a perimeter presence, Fullerton’s offense was out of sync and could not prevent UCSB from scoring as the Gauchos cruised to a 65-45 win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to end UC Davis’ undefeated conference record (3-0) as it will face the Aggies on Thursday, Jan. 21 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67461\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67461\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/","id":357,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[356,355,354],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2015-16 Big West Women’s Basketball Conference Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Big-West-Women.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Big-West-Women.png?resize=779%2C490&ssl=1","description":"Big West basketball season is in full swing.

Over the past three seasons, the Gauchos have amassed an overall record of 26-66.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67426\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67426\" data-attachment-id=\"67426\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/jasmine-ware-dribbles-around-the-court-cameryn-brockdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-13-of-13-web.jpg?fit=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"401,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"Jasmine Ware dribbles around the court.

Cameryn Brock/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The uncanny decline prompted the hiring of Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson, who had spent the last 11 years coaching at the University of Kansas. In her first year, Henrickson and the Gauchos currently sit at 4-12 overall and 1-1 in conference play, exceeding their total of two wins last season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara won three consecutive games entering conference play for the first time since the 2012-13 season, on the heels of an eight-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>“The record looks like we fell apart,” Henrickson said. “But in those stretches we had opportunities where we played pretty well and put ourselves in the position to win. We didn’t get it done, but we learned and grew from it. From the staff’s perspective, we respect the fact that every day they come back, no matter what the scoreboard says, and try to get it right.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kicked off conference play with a 78-67 win over Cal Poly before being outmatched by a superior UCR team 83-53 this past Saturday.</p>\n<p>Since scoring a career-high 27 points against Pepperdine earlier this season, sophomore guard Makala Roper was placed in the starting lineup and continues to emerge as a primary scorer for the Gauchos. She leads UCSB in scoring with an average of 12.1 points per game. Roper also holds the team-high in 20-point games with three.</p>\n<p>Despite Roper’s rise in production, the loss of freshman forward Kali Jones certainly affects UCSB’s presence in the paint. She has missed the team’s last five games and has been ruled indefinitely ineligible for the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to have somebody that produces at the five,” Henrickson said. “At the end of the day it’s about production. We have Kendra, Mi’Chael, Chaya and Je Zhé Newton at the five, but we just have not got the production that I know we’re going to need to be successful in a league that’s this talented.”</p>\n<p>UCSB received the least amount of votes in the Big West women’s basketball preseason poll and is expected to finish last in the standings. Yet, the Gauchos are playing their best basketball entering the second half of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continues conference play tonight on the road against Cal State Fullerton at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii by Michael Jorgenson </strong></p>\n<p>The Hawaii women’s basketball team came into this year as the clear favorite to finish atop the conference, collecting 13 of 17 first place votes in the preseason coaches’ poll. The Rainbow Wahine were coming off a season in which they dominated conference play, going 23-9 overall and 14-2 Big West as they won their first regular season conference title since the 1993-94 season.</p>\n<p>However, reigning Big West Coach of the Year Laura Beeman and her team have found how difficult it is to repeat success from one season to the next. Hawaii has managed only a middling 8-7 overall, 1-1 conference record to this point, sitting at fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine lost two starters from last year, including their leading scorer guard Shawna-Lei Kuehu — the team’s only double-digit scorer. This year, they are led by senior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana, a second team All-Big West selection in 2015.</p>\n<p>Karaitiana, the team’s top threat from deep, struggled mightily with her shot through her team’s nonconference schedule, hitting just 17.5 percent on three-point attempts. As a result, she comes in as just the team’s third-leading scorer at 8.1 points per game, behind sophomore center Megan Huff and senior guard/forward Destiny King, who average 8.2 and 9.8 ppg, respectively.</p>\n<p>Karaitiana seems to have gotten hot at the right time with conference play starting, as she has made 6-14 (42.9 percent) through the opening two games.</p>\n<p>Hawaii has not been able to find the rhythm on offense that saw it drop just two conference games in 2015, as it currently ranks fifth in scoring at 60.5 points a night. A big reason for this has been the team’s three-point shooting, which is second-worst in the league at 25.4 percent.</p>\n<p>However, its defense has been able to keep it in games, as it ranks first in opponent three-point shooting (25.4 percent) and opponent scoring (61.2 ppg).</p>\n<p>While it is still early, the Rainbow Wahine will need to improve if they are going to find a way to repeat as regular season champs and win the Big West Tournament. Getting the offense going may be the key, as they have allowed just 1.1 ppg more to opponents compared to last year while scoring 7.3 ppg less.</p>\n<p>Hawaii plays its third conference game tonight against Cal State Northridge in the Stan Sheriff Center at 9:00 p.m. PST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside by Daniel Moebus-Bowles </strong></p>\n<p>After taking home a big win on the road against Grand Canyon University, the UC Riverside women’s basketball team pushed back up to an even record of 7-7 to conclude the nonconference portion of their season. The Highlanders’ record placed them in the middle of the Big West standings at fifth place to enter the conference schedule, but their rank and record proved to not have any influence on their play to start the second half of the season.</p>\n<p>UCR is now 9-7, 2-0 in Big West play after victories over UC Irvine in its conference opener and UCSB last Saturday, extending its winning streak to three games. Riverside is now just one of two teams in the conference that boast an undefeated record through two conference games, its first 2-0 start since the 2007-08 season.</p>\n<p>“Conference play is a whole other animal,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “We had a very good schedule and if we learn from the teams we played and the games that we had, it will pay off for us in the Big West. We just need to focus on playing four quarters of basketball.”</p>\n<p>One of the Highlanders’ strong points this year has been their offense, as they have found most of their wins coming with high scores and large leads. So far this season, the team has averaged 75.4 points per game, and in their nine victories, that figure increases to 85.5 points. Those wins were not only high-scoring, but also dominated by Riverside, who has beaten every opponent by an average 21.0 points.</p>\n<p>“We have been very offensive-minded so far, which has led us to some of our big wins,” Margaritis explained. “Now we are looking to strengthen the defensive end of our game.”</p>\n<p>The team’s roster is decorated with three former Big West Freshman of the Year recipients, multiple members of Big West All-Conference teams and last year’s Big West Player of the Year. The all-around talent that this team possesses makes them a very deep and tough unit to break.</p>\n<p>The reigning Big West Player of the Year, senior guard Brittany Crain, is joined by junior transfer forward Réjane Verin at the top of the scorers list, as they lead the team with averages of 19.2 and 17.3 point per game, respectively. Senior guard Annelise Ito also complements Riverside’s offense as she leads the team in assists at 4.9 per game, is second in boards at 7.1 and third in points at 13.5. These three players account for a majority of the team’s statistics, but Margaritis explains that their success is a complete team effort.</p>\n<p>“You can’t just talk about a couple players when you think of this team — you really can’t leave any of them out of the discussion,” Margaritis said. “We have a whole team, and all of our players together are very difficult to play against.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders hope to continue their great start to conference play in their next game at Hawaii on Saturday, Jan. 16 at 9:00 p.m. in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly by Elliot Thornton </strong></p>\n<p>Ending last season on a bitter note with a first-round loss to Cal State Fullerton, Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh and the Cal Poly Mustangs look to make a deeper push in the Big West Tournament this year with a more experienced squad.</p>\n<p>Predicted to finish third in the Big West according to the conference media polls, the Mustangs are currently 8-7 overall and 1-1 in Big West play after a loss to Blue-Green rival UCSB and a win at UC Irvine. Since the departures of former seniors Kristen Ale, Taryn Garza and Ariana Elegado, expectations have been placed upon senior guard Beth Balbierz and junior forward Hannah Gilbert to fill their absence on the team.</p>\n<p>“Our pieces have changed [this year] and certainly they are significant pieces, but the main phases of our program are still intact,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>Certainly, there’s no avoiding the loss of players each season, and Cal Poly has maintained its prominence in the Big West by finishing in the top three or better of the conference for seven straight seasons.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ combination of Gilbert in the post and Balbierz at guard has been a consistent scoring force, as the two rank eighth and 11th in the conference with averages of 12.8 and 11.9 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>Gilbert, a two-year starter, led the conference in field-goal percentage last season at .526 percent. The 6’3” junior has proven to be a mismatch down low, scoring 15 points or more in four games this year, including a team-high 23-point outing in the Mustangs’ win over Sac State. Gilbert also leads the Big West in rebounds with 9.9 per game.</p>\n<p>After starting six games during her first two seasons, Balbierz has finally embraced a leadership role in Cal Poly’s backcourt. Leading the team with 23 makes from downtown this year, Mimnaugh will utilize Balbierz’s shooting ability to spread the floor and give more opportunities for Gilbert down low.</p>\n<p>“[Beth] has been waiting her turn playing the sixth man role during previous years,” Mimnaugh said. “Her intelligence on the court has been a savior for [us]. Beth has always had the ability to shoot the three, but she also added driving and passing skills to her repertoire this year, so we are very pleased with that.”</p>\n<p>Gilbert and Balbierz will be central components to the Mustangs’ success this year. The Mustangs will go as far as the two upperclassmen carry their team.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will face Cal State Fullerton in its conference home opener on Saturday, Jan. 16 at 4:00 p.m. at Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge by Jorge Mercado  </strong></p>\n<p>Coming off a great 23-win season a year ago and an NCAA Tournament bid, the two-time defending Big West Tournament Champion Cal State Northridge Matadors were hoping for another great season. However, they have struggled mightily, mustering only a 2-13 overall, 0-1 conference record and are currently in the midst of a five-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>“We want to just continue to get better each day,” Head Coach Jason Flowers said. “Daily improvement is constantly our focus.”</p>\n<p>The Matadors are currently tied for the worst record in the Big West with CSUF after falling to UC Davis 75-52 in their conference opener. With no seniors on the team, this inexperienced young roster has not been able to produce wins.</p>\n<p>They also faced a very difficult nonconference schedule with games against tough opponents such as No. 21 California, Utah, Georgia and Idaho. They were outscored by those four opponents by an average of 46 points per game, with Cal and Idaho each scoring 106 points in those matchups.</p>\n<p>“We challenged ourselves with our nonconference schedule,” Flowers said, “and found out how much we need to improve to get to the level we strive to attain.”</p>\n<p>Another reason for CSUN’s tough start is the graduation of their two top guards from a year ago, Ashlee Guay and Janae Sharpe. Both were named to the Big West Conference All-Tournament Team, while Guay was awarded with MVP honors.</p>\n<p>Even though the team has been underwhelming to this point, they are still contenders in the Big West. The Matadors still have a great head coach in Flowers, who has twice been named the Big West Conference Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p>CSUN also retained Big West All-Freshman forward Tessa Boagni, who currently leads the team in scoring with 12.4 points per game, which is ninth best in the conference, and shooting, knocking down 48.4 percent of her shots.</p>\n<p>However, in order to truly turn this season around, the Matadors will need to take better care of the ball. They currently average 18.5 turnovers per game, fourth worst in the Big West. They will also need to play better on defense, as they rank last in the conference, allowing marks of 79.9 ppg and 46 percent shooting to opponents.</p>\n<p>“We have grown in various areas throughout this season,” Flowers said. “We will continue to do so through March.”</p>\n<p>CSUN plays its second conference game today at Hawaii at 9 p.m. PST in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State by Antonia Bird</strong></p>\n<p>After putting together one of the most outstanding seasons in recent history in 2014-15, the Long Beach State women’s basketball team is eager to make history again.</p>\n<p>Their 22-10 overall record last season was the team’s best since 1990-91. Moreover, their 13-1 nonconference record last season was the best in school history.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is in the midst of another solid start as it heads into Big West play, currently standing at 12-4 overall and 1-1 in conference. The conference’s opening weekend saw the 49ers fall against Hawaii 67-55 before blowing out Cal State Fullerton 82-61 on the road. With such an impressive early record, Long Beach appears set to repeat last year’s success and will once again be the team to beat.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ biggest threats are junior guards Raven Benton and Jewelyn Sawyer. Each are well-rounded players who play crucial roles in the team’s success.</p>\n<p>After sitting out the last eight games of her sophomore year due to an injury, Benton has proven herself ready in these first 14 games of her junior season. She leads her team with 13.1 points per game and is second with an average of 5.3 rebounds per game. She is off to a hot start in conference play, averaging 20 points a night while shooting 50 percent from the field and 63.6 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Teammate Jewelyn Sawyer is yet another option for Long Beach, as she holds the second best average for points per game with 10.5. She saw an impressive game high of 16 points in the 49ers’ nonconference finale against Seattle two weeks ago. Sawyer’s biggest advantage is her ability to rebound, as she currently leads the team with 6.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s next game will be at UC Irvine this Saturday at 2:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis by Ryan Burns </strong></p>\n<p>After its loss in the semi-finals of last year’s Big West Tournament, the UC Davis women’s basketball team has entered conference play with the intent of landing near or at the top of the standings at the end of the regular season.</p>\n<p>“We are all competitive and would love to win a championship, but the ultimate goal is to make sure our players are growing,” UC Davis Head Coach Jennifer Gross said.</p>\n<p>The Aggies finished in fifth place in the Big West last season with an 8-8 record (15-16 overall), but most of the team’s stars returned this year. Senior forward Alyson Doherty was named to the preseason All-Conference team prior to this season, and two games into Big West play, she is leading the Aggies with averages of 6.5 rebounds and 1.67 blocks per game. She is also second on the team in scoring, averaging 13.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>The team’s leading scorer is forward Morgan Bertsch with an average of 13.4 ppg. The redshirt freshman has come alive in recent weeks, as she notched three 20-point performances in December and forced her way into the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>“Alyson Doherty and Celia Marfone have played a lot of minutes for us since their freshmen year,” Gross said. “This year we have asked them to be more vocal on the court and help set the tone with consistent effort and energy.”</p>\n<p>Gross has been at the helm of the Aggies’ coaching staff for five years after playing her collegiate career in Davis. After four years with the Doherty-led senior class, the coach believes the team’s upperclassmen are setting a good example for the younger stars.</p>\n<p>“They are well respected amongst their teammates and have a strong voice, especially when assisting some of our younger players,” Gross said.</p>\n<p>Three underclassmen, including Bertsch and sophomores Pele Gianotti and Dani Nafekh, are among the top five in minutes per game for UCD. If freshman breakout Bertsch is regularly able to put up big numbers, she will be an early contender for the Big West Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p>“This preseason provided us with so many opportunities to grow, and we have improved in a lot of areas, but understand that we still have a lot of work to do,” Gross said. “There is still so much time to improve and I am excited to see where this team can be in March.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton by Sinead Leon </strong></p>\n<p>With Big West play upon us, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team is looking to break their 13-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>After being voted to finish sixth in this year’s preseason coach’s poll, the Titans finished their nonconference schedule in eighth place with an overall record of 2-12 and have since lost their conference opener to Long Beach State 82-61.</p>\n<p>“We are an extremely young team learning the differences between high school and college basketball,” Head Coach Daron Park said. “I think we have the potential to be a very competitive team in the Big West Conference — I just don’t know when that light will click on for them.”</p>\n<p>Last year, Fullerton averaged 59.7 points per game, but its weakness was mainly that it lacked defense and in return would allow 62.6 on average.</p>\n<p>To top it off, the Titans have been faced with having to replace more than half of their offensive production from last year with the loss of two of the Big West’s top scorers in graduated seniors Chante Miles and Kathleen Iwuoha.</p>\n<p>Someone who is doing a fine job at that is guard/forward Michelle Berry, who began conference play with four double-doubles. In the last conference game against North Dakota State, the freshman scored 16 points while also leading the team with four assists.</p>\n<p>Another new face to watch out for is freshman guard Lauren Nubla. She led her high school team to the CIF Division I Championship Title, was named Athlete of the Year and received the CIF Sportsmanship Award in her senior year with 246 points and 14 three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Nubla scored a season-high11 points in the Titans’ last nonconference game of the season.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited about Lauren and her contributions so far this season,” Park said. “She is another freshman playing significant minutes and being asked to shoulder upperclassman responsibility. I expect her to continue to grow and develop as a player as conference play begins.”</p>\n<p>The Titans look to climb out of the bottom spot where they have ended up the last couple of years, continuing their conference schedule with their second Big West game against UCSB tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Titan Gym in Fullerton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine by Xavier Cardenas </strong></p>\n<p>The Anteaters were predicted to finish eighth in the conference by the Big West Media Preseason Poll and are experiencing a downward trend since the start of the Big West schedule. Irvine’s six-game slump prior to entering conference play has now extended to eight consecutive games after losses to UC Riverside and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters concluded the nonconference portion of their season with an overall record of 3-11, but are now 3-13, 0-2 after the pair of Big West losses. Although they have suffered losses against tough opponents such as USC, UCLA and Princeton, UCI has shown resilience.</p>\n<p>“They are a resilient group — we have not played good basketball [during this stretch]. It’s unfortunate, but we have not been playing well offensively and we cannot score,” Head Coach Doug Oliver said. “Until that turns around, we will not be competitive.”</p>\n<p>However, Oliver remains optimistic about UCI’s remaining schedule, maintaining the mindset of taking it one game at a time. Despite Irvine’s struggles during nonconference play and its winless start to its Big West schedule, the hope is that the Anteaters will hit their stride throughout the remainder of conference play.</p>\n<p>“Usually at this point teams have developed an identity, and we are struggling to come up with who we are,” Oliver said. “Seasons are in parts — nonconference, season and postseason. We got through the nonconference part of play, and it didn’t go our way, but let’s move on.”</p>\n<p>Currently the Anteaters are the second worst scoring team in the conference at 57.9 ppg and are last in field goal percentage at 34.7 percent. As its offense struggles to produce, Irvine will depend on its defense to create plays on the other end of the court.</p>\n<p>“Our concentration is on our defensive effort — really, for us it’s rebounding,” said Oliver. “We play a lot more zone defense than other teams, which causes issues on rebounds. If we break even on rebounds we will make open shots.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding is most important for UC Irvine and it will need the efforts of All-Conference forward junior Mokun Fajemisin. Fajemisin has recorded 25 blocks and is averaging 7.9 rebounds per game, placing her second and third respectively in Big West in both statistical categories.</p>\n<p>With hopes to turn things around, the Anteaters’ next game will be against UC Davis on Thursday, Jan. 14 at 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*All stats accurate as of 1/13/16</p>\n<p>A version of this article was published in January 14, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67364\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67364\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/","id":380,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[379,378,377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Prepare for First Road Trip of Conference Schedule, Face CSUF and CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_5-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Now 4-12, 1-1 in Big West games after a blowout loss to UC Riverside last Saturday, the UCSB women's basketball looks to redeem itself on the road against Cal State Fullerton on Thursday and Cal State...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On the road for its first pair of away conference games of the season, the UCSB women’s basketball team hopes to rid its winless streak of 0-8 when playing away from the Thunderdome.

CSUF currently owns an overall record of 2-13, 0-1 after a loss to Long Beach State in its conference opener. The tale is similar for CSUN who is also 2-13, 0-1 after a conferencing opening loss to UC Davis.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the Big West schedule beginning last week, the transition into conference play offers an opportunity for teams that may have struggled during non-conference play to uplift their seasons. All below the .500 mark, it is assured that each team has its sight set on a possible ‘Cinderella’ story to close out the season.</p>\n<p>“We don’t value who they [CSUF &amp; CSUN] are based off their win-loss record,” Henrickson said. “Especially, look at Fullerton, they beat LMU, were in a six-point game with Pepperdine and went into overtime with Wyoming. I would hope we are mature enough to recognize that a record isn’t indicative [of our season].</p>\n<p>Certainly, a team’s overall record isn’t always indicative of its performance on the court. UCSB proved this last season, earning its first win of the season against the Titans after a 0-24, 0-11 start. Still in the process of developing into a team that can collectively play a full four quarters, Santa Barbra’s matchups this week will simply come down to more than just who can score and defend.</p>\n<p>It will come down to the miscellaneous fundamentals of the game. Particularly, the Gauchos’ ability to protect the ball and not turn it over. Overall, UCSB averages 21.9 turnovers per game, but have turned it over by an average of 26 times per game since the start of conference play. In six consecutive games, it has recorded 20 or more turnovers. The blame for the Gauchos’ miscues can only be placed upon themselves as they have constantly committed traveling violations.</p>\n<p>“We just made really bad decisions and now we’ve thrown traveling into it,” Henrickson said. “They’re your feet, control your feet. But, that’s discipline and focus on attention to detail.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB is not the only team affected by the error of turnovers as Fullerton finished with a season-high 27 turnovers in its conference opener.</p>\n<p>The loss of four senior players, three of which were starters, leaves CSUF with a young team of primarily underclassmen. A total of five freshmen are listed on the Titans’ roster while it has just one redshirt senior.</p>\n<p>While the loss of All-Big West First Teamer guard Chante Miles, who averaged 19.4 points per game, the emergence of freshman combo guard/forward Michelle Berry gives Fullerton something to rejoice about now and for the future.</p>\n<p>She made an emphatic start to her collegiate career with a 38-point performance in the Titans’ season opening victory versus Portland State. It was a monumental outing as Berry’s point total serves as the most by a freshman in program history, prompting her to become the first freshman to earn Big West Athlete of the Week honors as well.</p>\n<p>Complementing Berry’s scoring efforts is the Titan’s three-point shooting ability. On average, Fullerton attempts a total of 22.3 shots from deep, producing its 30.4 three-point percentage. It currently leads the Big West in total threes made with 102. Despite LBSU setting a Big West single-game record against them with 20 three-point field goals, the Titans nearly matched the 49ers feat with a season-high 13 three-point makes of their own.</p>\n<p>The sharpshooting of freshman guard Dani Craig from beyond the arc is a pivotal asset to Fullerton’s success from the perimeter. She ranks second in the Big West in total three-pointers made with 35 and is fifth in three-point percentage at 36.8.</p>\n<p>On average, Santa Barbara holds opponents to 30.5 percent shooting from behind the three-point line. With the Gauchos being undersized in the paint, opponents usually base their offensive game in the paint. Certainly, Fullerton will take three-point shot attempts, but it will be interesting to see how much the Titans feed the post.</p>\n<p>Continuing UCSB’s pair of road games is its matchup at Cal State Northridge on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ resurgence over the last two years has been outstanding as the reigning Big West champions have won the conference tournament for the last two consecutive years, winning its first regular season title in program history in the 2013-14 season.</p>\n<p>After setting a program record with 23 wins last season (23-11, 11-5), CSUN’s sudden decline has been a shock to many. Yet, its current 2-13, 0-1 record is justified by its loss of five seniors, four of which were in its starting lineup just last season. The replacement of the 2013 Big West Player of the Year and All-Big West First Teamer guard Ashlee Guay along with All-Big West Honorable Mentions Cinnamon Lister and Janae Sharpe has been difficult.</p>\n<p>Yet, the upside of sophomore forward Tessa Boagni has been a spark within the Matadors’ slow start to the season. An All-Big West Freshman Team selection last year, Boagni leads CSUN in scoring with 12.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>While Boagni has embraced a bigger role on offense, the team as a collective unit has played poorly on defense. CSUN has been outscored by opponents by a point differential of 19.9 ppg this season while allowing 79.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>Prior to its loss to UC Riverside last Saturday, UCSB had been averaging 86.6 ppg during its three-game winning streak. In spite of a great start to their last game, the Gauchos must remain committed to their style of play on offense and not allow the tempo of their opponent decide their playing style.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s matchup against Cal State Fullerton will begin at 7 p.m. in Titan Gym. It will face Cal State Northridge on Sunday at 4 p.m. in the Matadome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/","id":379,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[378,377,376],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivals Look for First Big West Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos went 3-0 against Cal Poly in 2015, but can they defeat the Mustangs in a hostile road environment with both teams looking for their first conference win?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67354\" style=\"width: 197px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67354\" data-attachment-id=\"67354\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/mbball_vsohio-20151121-dustinharris-2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Gabe Vincent tries to gain control after he slips through some players.

The Mustangs enter with an identical record of 6-8, 0-1, also having lost at Hawai’i last week.</p>\n<p>“We just need to have the same mindset we had during that four-game winning streak. We were focused and playing together and we worked on a couple different things in practice to be more cohesive,” sophomore forward Alex Hart said. “With Cal Poly it’s a rivalry, so I think that’s been fueling the guys in practice this week to take care of that.”</p>\n<p>Last season, UCSB went undefeated in its three games against Cal Poly, including a 54-50 win in the Big West Tournament Quarterfinals. However, none of those wins came in particularly convincing fashion, as the Gauchos managed only a 5.67 average margin of victory, with current leading scorer in senior guard Michael Bryson averaged just eight points in each of those games.</p>\n<p>That average will likely be surpassed tonight, as Bryson has shined as UCSB’s top offensive option so far this season. The 6’4″ guard leads the Big West in scoring at 19.5 points per game, shooting at a highly efficient clip of 47.3 percent from the field, third-best among guards.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for Cal Poly is senior guard David Nwaba, who averages team-highs in points (11.5 ppg), rebounds (5.8 rpg), assists (4.5 apg) and steals (1.64 spg).</p>\n<p>After a slow start to the season for UCSB, reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent has found his shot in recent games, going 15-31 on three-pointers in his last five outings. The sophomore guard backs up Bryson as the team’s second-leading scorer, putting in 12.6 ppg. Vincent ranks fifth in the conference at 2.3 three-point makes per game, hitting 40 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is virtually tied with Cal Poly for sixth in shooting percentage at just under 44 percent, but the Mustangs average the second most points in the conference at 75.4 a game. That mark can be attributed to their taking good care of the ball, averaging a conference-best 10.5 TO per game, as well as their 37.9 percent shooting from deep, which ranks second. On the other side, the Gauchos average just 70.4 ppg and convert 33.7 percent of their threes, both good for seventh in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Further bringing down the UCSB offense is its inability to get to the free throw line. The Gauchos average just 15.2 FTA per game, putting them miles behind conference leader Cal State Fullerton’s average of 25.9.</p>\n<p>“Free throws have been a big thing all year,” Hart said. “I think we’ve been starting to catch up with the rest of the conference though, especially with our guards attacking a lot more, getting to the rim and getting contact. I think we’re on the right track.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ inability to get to the line hurt them down the stretch in their opener against Hawai’i, as they were outshot 13-2 in the second half from the charity stripe in a game that went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>“We need to work on starting the second half strong,” Hart said. “A lot of times, we come out lacking energy. If we come out strong and get off to a good start in the second half it’ll really help us finish out games.”</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Mustangs haven’t fared quite as well from the line, making just 2.78 more free throws per game than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, Cal Poly has struggled, allowing the most points to opponents in the conference at 75.9 per game. The Gauchos meanwhile have been solid when they don’t have possession, ranking third in opponent field goal defense (40.6%)  and second in three-point defense (31%). However, no matter if the offense has been hot or cold this season, Head Coach Bob Williams’ team has continued to emphasize defense and refused to get complacent with its effort.</p>\n<p>“We need to keep making defensive improvements,” Lakoju said. “Offense is something we can improve every day, but if we lock down defensively then our offense should be able to translate.”</p>\n<p>This will be the last of a two-game road trip for the Gauchos before they return home for three straight, starting with UC Irvine this Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal Poly are set to tip-off at 7 p.m. tonight at the Mott Athletics Center in San Luis Obispo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67360\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67360\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/","id":355,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[354,353,352],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Winning Streak Comes to End in Conference Opener at Hawai’i","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team fell to Hawai'i 65-57 in its conference opening game this past Saturday, ending a four-game win streak.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67275\" style=\"width: 207px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67275\" data-attachment-id=\"67275\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/mbball_vsohio-20151121-dustinharris-4-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"DaJuan Smith looks for an opening through the defense.

For the game, the sophomore guard went 7-13 from the field and 5-5 from the free throw line. Jankovic was solid the entire night, putting up 19 points on an efficient 9-14 from the field to go along with nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite playing every minute of the game, Hawai’i senior guard Roderick Bobbitt had a rough shooting night, making just 1-10 shots, but still managed a decent output with six points, seven boards and four assists.</p>\n<p>The free throw disparity in the second half favored Hawai’i 13-2 in attempts and played a big part in the UCSB loss as it has all season. At the start of conference play, the Gauchos ranked last in attempts by a wide margin at just 199 through 15 games, while Hawaii had already surpassed 330 attempts.</p>\n<p>While the offense struggled as a group, Bryson and Vincent were able to keep UCSB in it until late.
