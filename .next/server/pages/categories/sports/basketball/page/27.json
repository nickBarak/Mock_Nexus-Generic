Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they couldn’t pull off the last minute comeback, falling 54-50.</p>\n<p>This latest loss keeps Santa Barbara in last place at 0-18 overall and 0-5 in the conference, while the Titans moved into a three-way tie for fourth place at 9-9 overall and 3-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos haven’t found themselves in a game late in the second half for a number of contests, but with 6:14 to go against Fullerton, a jumper by senior center Clair Watkins put them up 41-38. However, the Titans answered back with an 8-0 run that included back-to-back layups by senior guard/forward Kathleen Iwuoha to take control of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a pair of free-throws by senior guard Chante Miles gave Fullerton some distance with a 51-45 lead, UCSB’s Kristine Brance answered right back with a clutch three to cut the lead to three with 57 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>Brance came into the game on the heels of her best performance of the season on Thursday against Riverside and was hot once again. The senior guard was 6-12 from the field, including 3-6 from three-point range on her way to a team and season-best 15 points.</p>\n<p>A UCSB stop on the following possession gave the Gauchos a chance to tie the game. Sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe missed a two-point jumper from the top of the key, leading to more free-throws from Miles.</p>\n<p>Miles was the Titans’ leading scorer on the night and was able to put the game away at the line, knocking down 5-6 in the final 1:16 of the game. Her offensive efficiency showed from every spot on the floor, as she made 3-4 from downtown, 6-11 overall from the field, and 13-15 from the line on her way to a game-high 28 points. The game eventually ended 54-50 in favor of Fullerton.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth start to a game which saw eight lead changes and five ties was separated by a jumper from junior guard Jasmine Ware with 59 seconds remaining in the first half, putting UCSB up 24-22 heading into halftime. It was the first time the Gauchos took a lead into halftime all season. It was also just the third time UCSB outrebounded its opponent, taking a 32-30 advantage.</p>\n<p>Ware finished the game with six points and a season-high seven rebounds. Watkins added 10 points of her own while junior forward Kendra Morrison put in six points while picking up a season-best six rebounds.</p>\n<p>The four-point loss was the closest UCSB has been at the final buzzer since a 47-44 margin of defeat against Idaho in the second game of the season.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos are a pair of home games against UC Irvine and UC Davis this Thursday and Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

team’s 68-49 win Saturday against Cal State Fullerton at the Thunderdome. Despite playing without two of their best scorers, the Gauchos leaned on junior guard Michael Bryson’s game-high 23 points to earn their second win of the week.</p>\n<p>The victory gets UCSB back on track after coming off possibly its worst week of basketball in the season with losses to Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State. However, with this week’s sweep over UC Riverside and Fullerton, the Gauchos improve to 10-9 overall and 3-2 in Big West. Fullerton continues winless in conference at 0-5 and 8-12 overall.</p>\n<p>It was Bryson who carried the load offensively for the Gauchos. Still without the team’s leading scorer in senior center Alan Williams (shoulder injury), Bryson looked for his shot right from the start, knocking down half of his 16 shot attempts, while making all of his four free throws to make him the program’s leader in most consecutive free throws made with 34.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I think I’ve gotten to a pretty good rhythm right now,” Bryson said. “I know when to take my shots at this point.

His work on the glass really gave the team the advantage; Green’s 10 rebounds gave him his first career double-double and came at the heels of him grabbing only 11 combined boards his previous three games.</p>\n<p>“You have to make up for the ways Alan contributes to the team,” Green said. “My whole focus was to rebound more because the last couple of games in the conference I wasn’t rebounding a lot, so coaches really have been telling me to focus on rebounding and playing my game, which is really going to take me to the next level.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton had its first halftime lead of the conference season, leading 36-31. UCSB began to take control of the second half after a 19-0 run that gave the Gauchos a decisive 52-40 lead with 10 minutes left.</p>\n<p>For CSUF, the league’s fifth leading scorer coming into the game, senior guard Alex Harris, was kept in check for only four points. After shooting 46 percent in the first half, the Titans managed to only nail 13 percent of their shots in the second.</p>\n<p>“They came out 6-13 [shooting from three-point range]. In the second half they’re going to start to cool down, they’re going to start to fatigue,” Green said. “Just as long as we contest shots and play good defense, they’re not going to fall, which was what happened in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara goes on the road now for its first two-game conference road trip. The team plays UC Davis Thursday and UC Irvine Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/mens-basketball-dominates-second-half-defeats-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/mens-basketball-dominates-second-half-defeats-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/mens-basketball-dominates-second-half-defeats-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/mens-basketball-dominates-second-half-defeats-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/mens-basketball-dominates-second-half-defeats-fullerton/","id":465,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[464,463,462],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Rolls Past UCR Without Big Al","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Career nights from John Green and Mitch Brewe lifted the UCSB men's basketball team past Riverside in an early season must-win game.

Meanwhile, Riverside falls to 9-10 and 2-3 in league, having won only one game on the road.</p>\n<p>It was a trio of juniors that got the job done for UCSB. Along with Brewe, guard John Green also scored a career-high in points with 21, adding nine rebounds. Guard Michael Bryson, after scoring no points the previous game, came out shooting to start and finished with 16 points on 7-12 from the field.</p>\n<p>“I thought our junior class was excellent. They competed, made plays, made shots,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They played with aggression, they went after rebounds. They played the way they were capable of playing, which was really good to see.”</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 51 percent for the game, primarily because the Gauchos made an emphasis on scoring in the low post, punishing the Highlanders 32-18 in the paint. UCR was tied with the Gauchos going into halftime, in large part because of its eight threes made from the perimeter.</p>\n<p>However, the hot shooting did not translate into the second half for the Highlanders, while UCSB remained aggressive for the duration of the game.</p>\n<p>“We challenged them well before Al went down, that they have to be more assertive than they were last week,” Coach Williams said. “I’m happiest about how we came out and competed. We played more aggressive, we went at the rim, we did things you got to do in a basketball game.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was a major advantage for the Gauchos. Although not apparent on the stat sheet, senior guard Zalmico Harmon had a standout performance, delivering the ball to the right man and orchestrating the offense for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Eric Childress again proved to be a valuable asset off the bench; his eight rebounds were a career-high and his eight points were the most he has scored so far in the season.</p>\n<p>“Seeing [Childress get eight rebounds] just tells you how aggressive he was offensively and defensively,” Bryson said. “He read the passing lanes and played a great game.”</p>\n<p>For UC Riverside, junior guard Jaylen Bland led the team with 21 points and senior guard Austin Quick gave the Highlanders a lift off the bench, going 4-7 from the field to finish with 13 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB now waits until Saturday to play Cal State Fullerton at home.

The Gauchos will remain on the road tomorrow night when they play at Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The much needed win brings UCR to 2-3 in conference and 11-8 overall as it tries to improve upon its current seventh place standing. UCSB remains in last place now at 0-17 overall and 0-4 to begin Big West play.</p>\n<p>A rare hot start out of the gates saw the Gauchos take an 11-6 lead after a jumper by junior forward Kendra Morrison with 13:34 remaining in the first stanza. From that point on it was all downhill for UCSB, as Riverside answered back with a 25-4 run to take control of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCR’s Brittany Crain was unstoppable as she has been for most of the season, knocking down 5-7 three-pointers in the first half alone. The junior guard played every minute of the game, finishing with 29 points on 11-18 shooting to go along with six rebounds and two steals.</p>\n<p>The second half told a very different story for the Gauchos, who were the hottest they’ve been all year. With just four turnovers as a team in the half, UCSB scored 48 points behind the shooting of Roper, who finished the night with a career-best 23 points on 9-13 from the field and 5-8 from downtown. Senior guard Kristine Brance also chipped in with 12 points with a perfect 4-4 shooting mark, and sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe nearly recorded a double-double with 10 points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>UCSB recorded offensive season-highs all over the place, including its 74 points, 54.5 percent shooting overall and 60 percent from threes, and 23 assists.</p>\n<p>Despite outshooting the Highlanders though, the difference came on the glass and from the free-throw line. The Gauchos, who had a -10 rebound margin coming into the game, could not solve one of their biggest problems as they were outrebounded 34-23. Riverside also attempted 28 free throws, double what the Gauchos attempted, making 22 of them.</p>\n<p>For the Highlanders, junior guard Annelise Ito poured in 21 points to back up Crain, while freshman guard Michelle Curry added 19 of her own. Both players capitalized from the line all night, accounting for 20 of the team’s 22 made free-throws.</p>\n<p>Against Cal State Fullerton tomorrow night, UCSB will be up against another dominant scorer in Chante Miles. The senior guard trails only Crain in scoring for the year, coming in at 18.9 points per game and leading her team by knocking down nearly three three-pointers a game.</p>\n<p>This will be the best matchup that the Gauchos have had since the beginning of Big West play, as the Titans average just 60.8 points per game, good for seventh in the conference. If UCSB is able to stay hot, it will have its best chance in some time to pick up its first win an end a 22-game losing streak that dates back to last February.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Titans are set to tip-off tomorrow at 6:00 p.m. in Titan Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/hot-shooting-gauchos-downed-by-ucr-face-fullerton-next/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/hot-shooting-gauchos-downed-by-ucr-face-fullerton-next/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/hot-shooting-gauchos-downed-by-ucr-face-fullerton-next/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/hot-shooting-gauchos-downed-by-ucr-face-fullerton-next/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/hot-shooting-gauchos-downed-by-ucr-face-fullerton-next/","id":463,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[462,461,460],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Winless Gauchos Continue Search for First Win at UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Women's basketball is still in search of its first win of the season on the road against UC Riverside.

The Highlanders have managed a respectable 10-8 overall record but haven’t gotten off to the best start in Big West play at just 1-3.</p>\n<p>The main problems that have been bringing UCSB down all year haven’t improved since Big West began two weeks ago, as both its scoring average and margin of victory have decreased.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos find themselves in last place in the conference in a number of categories including scoring, field-goal and three-point percentage, rebounding, assists and opponent shooting.</p>\n<p>Where UCSB has done well is in ball control, where they rank fourth at 16.2 turnovers a game, a strength they will need going up against one of the better defenses in the league.</p>\n<p>Sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe has been a bright spot all year as she has assumed a leadership role within a team that has lacked an identity since the first game of the season. Jemerigbe comes in at sixth in the conference in assists with 3.7 a game while leading the team in both scoring (8.2 ppg) and field-goal percentage (44.1).</p>\n<p>Coming in off the bench, guard Makala Roper has provided a spark all year with her long-range shooting, accounting for 65.8 percent of her team’s total three-pointers with 25. The freshman knocks down 2.64 threes per 40 minutes, good for eighth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, senior center Clair Watkins has held down the middle averaging the second-most blocks per game with an average of 1.9.</p>\n<p>Statistically, Riverside has been a near mirror-opposite from the Gauchos. Led by Brittany Crain, the Highlanders possess a potent offense that ranks third in conference scoring at 69.1 points per game and second in three-point percentage at 34.9. Crain has piled up a conference-most three Big West Player of the Week awards this season due to her ability to excel on both sides of the court. Along with being the Big West’s leader in points per game (23.6), steals per game (2.3) and free throws made (74), she has shown her efficiency, coming in at second in three-point percentage (39.8) and fourth in free throw percentage (78.7).</p>\n<p>Backing up Crain on the offensive side are sophomore and junior guards Simone DeCoud and Annelise Ito, who average 12.9 and 11.6 points per game, respectively. Ito is also fifth in the conference in rebounding, pulling down an impressive 6.9 a game. Redshirt senior guard Dynese Adams will likely put pressure on the Gauchos’ frontcourt, as she is neck-and-neck with Crain for first in the Big West in steals, Crain with 42 and Adams with 41.</p>\n<p>Despite Crain’s excellence, this hasn’t turned into a whole lot of wins for Riverside, as it most recently dropped back-to-back nine-point losses at UC Davis and Hawaii last week, falling into seventh place in the conference at just 1-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Riverside are set to tipoff tonight at 7 p.m. at the UCR Student Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/winless-gauchos-continue-search-for-first-win-at-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/winless-gauchos-continue-search-for-first-win-at-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/winless-gauchos-continue-search-for-first-win-at-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/winless-gauchos-continue-search-for-first-win-at-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/winless-gauchos-continue-search-for-first-win-at-ucr/","id":462,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[461,460,459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big Al Out Indefinitely, UCSB Hosts Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Already 1-2 in Big West, men's basketball has the difficult task of playing without its leading scorer, Alan Williams, this week.

In that game, UCSB shot a miserable 25 percent from the field and at one point, missed 25 of 27 attempts. Already having suffered a loss to Cal State Northridge two days before, consecutive losses place the Gauchos in seventh place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Riverside comes in 9-9 overall and 2-2 in league after last week’s split at home, fourth in league.</p>\n<p>To make up for Big Al’s spot in the starting lineup, junior forward Sam Beeler will start in place along with junior guard John Green, while junior forward Mitch Brewe will be relegated to the bench. UCSB will need to count on Green, freshman Gabe Vincent and junior guard Michael Bryson — the team’s shooters — to provide the offense Williams normally provides.</p>\n<p>“We will run only things that we feel benefit that group,” Coach Williams said. “A lot of stuff we run and plays we run, are built around playing for Al, and so now we’re not going to have Al so, it opens up more room for others to penetrate. We’re going to have to hit jump shots no doubt.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB to pick things up offensively, Bryson will have to shake off his performance from his two previous games. It was Bryson who catapulted the Gauchos to a win in their conference opener against Cal Poly, but versus CSUN and Long Beach, he combined for a total of eight points, not scoring at all against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of the guys we’re challenging,” Coach Williams said. “There are a lot of options for him to get involved. Number one thing is you play harder, be more aggressive, make more things happen.”</p>\n<p>Bryson could get the hot hand this weekend as UCR is ranked fifth in the Big West in points allowed.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders will counter with junior forward Taylor Johns, who is second in the league in rebounds with 8.4. Johns is a player quick off the bounce and has expanded his game with a perimeter shot. He could be a problem for Green and Brewe because of his quickness.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of January 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/","id":456,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[455,454,453],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Back-to-Back, Remain Winless","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB's struggles continued in a pair of blowout losses to Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59868\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/01.17.15ChristinaDeMarzoWBball9.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1348518318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59848\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59868\" data-attachment-id=\"59868\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-19/gauchos-drop-back-to-back-remain-winless/01-17-15christinademarzowbball9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/01.17.15ChristinaDeMarzoWBball9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"against Long Beach State, Onome Jemerigbe dribbles the ball to the opposite side of the court\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421506959\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"01.17.15ChristinaDeMarzoWBball9\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Playing against Long Beach State, Onome Jemerigbe dribbles the ball to the opposite side of the court.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Things didn’t get any easier for the struggling UCSB women’s basketball team this past weekend as it suffered a pair of blowout losses to the Big West’s top two overall records. After dropping Thursday’s road game at Cal State Northridge 84-48, the Gauchos returned home where they were dominated by Long Beach State, losing 81-44.</p>\n<p>With two more losses, UCSB has now fallen to 0-16 on the year and 0-3 to start conference play. After defeating the Gauchos, Northridge went on to lose at Cal Poly on Saturday as it moved to 12-6 overall and a disappointing 2-2 in the Big West. The 49ers, who have been nearly unstoppable all season, were perfect over the weekend, improving their record to 17-1 overall and 4-0 in conference.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s Youth Night on Saturday, the Gauchos found themselves in a favorable position midway through the first half as they stole momentum from the Big West’s hottest team in Long Beach State. Junior forward Kendra Morrison got the run started with a pair of jumpers and freshman guard Makala Roper knocked down her first of three triples in the game as UCSB played its best five-minute stretch of the weekend. A pair of buckets by sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe capped an impressive 13-3 run, giving the Gauchos their only lead of the game at 19-18.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Roper went on to finish the night with a career-high 15 points on 3-5 from downtown on the night as she continued to shine as the team’s top shooting threat.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, as has been the case for much of this season, it was unable to sustain its stretch of solid play. The 49ers immediately answered back with a 20-2 run of their own to take control of the game. Long Beach took a 41-20 lead into halftime after knocking down 7-13 three-pointers in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled to handle Long Beach’s pressure for most of the game, resulting in a 16-6 difference in steals in favor of the 49ers. The visitors finished off the Gauchos with a hot shooting second-half, making 55 percent of their shots as they went on to win 81-44.</p>\n<p>It was another efficient night from Jemerigbe, who turned in 10 points on 4-5 shooting with a team-high five assists. On Long Beach’s side, sophomore guard Raven Benton and senior guard Alex Sanchez led the way with 17 and 16 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s away game against Northridge told a similar story, as the Gauchos used an early 9-0 run to pull within a point at 16-17 midway through the first half. Just like on Saturday, UCSB was unable to keep momentum as the Matadors used a 17-0 run to blow the game open.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Northridge could not be stopped as it went on to shoot 57.4 percent for the game and knock down ten three-pointers, both good for second-best in program history. The team also put in a season-high 26 assists as it went on to win in dominating fashion, 84-48.</p>\n<p>Freshman center Tessa Boagni put in a career-high 17 points to lead all scorers on 8-11 shooting to go with a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>One of the Gauchos’ biggest weaknesses all year was exploited once again as it allowed both the 49ers and the Matadors to shoot 50 percent from three-point range, going 18-36 overall.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its search for win number one this Thursday against UC Riverside.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

their 2014-15 campaign would go this poorly. The Gauchos were voted to finish last in the conference in the Preseason Coaches’ Media Poll, and at 0-14 overall and 0-1 to start conference play, they will be looking to put the preseason behind them as they try to salvage their season.</p>\n<p>“Our record is definitely not a place I would have ever thought we would be at,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We were definitely exploited with our tough non-conference schedule, there’s no doubt we had the toughest schedule in the Big West.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That difficult schedule has resulted in UCSB being outscored by an average of over 20 points per game through 14 contests. The defense has been extremely generous from the perimeter, allowing teams to shoot an astounding 40 percent from three-point range, a mark that would be on the extreme side at any level of competition.</p>\n<p>The recurring issue for the Gauchos on the offensive side has been their inability to shoot with any consistency. They are shooting just 31.8 percent from the field and 19.4 percent from beyond the arc, both worst in the conference.</p>\n<p>“[Our offense] is hard to evaluate at this point, because is it a skill that you come in with or is that something that can be developed over time?” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we ask our kids to take the easy shots so when there are contested shots you don’t feel as much pressure to knock those down.”</p>\n<p>Inexperience has been an issue for UCSB as underclassmen have logged large amounts of minutes. This problem is only highlighted by the fact that the only two seniors on the roster in center Clair Watkins and guard Kristine Brance are playing in just their second year with the program.</p>\n<p>“Probably the most experienced player on our team is a sophomore in Onome Jemerigbe,” Mitchell said. “We coach it so that everyone knows that on any given night it could be their name called, but the problem is that right now we don’t have a person who has shown consistently that they will have the ability to step up in the game.”</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe, the 5’5” sophomore point guard, has emerged as the leader on the offensive side, leading the team in points per game (8.1) and field-goal percentage (41.1). Junior guard Jasmine Ware comes in at second on the team in scoring with 8.0 points per game, and Watkins leads the way from inside the paint with 7.2 points per game and team-highs of 6.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks a game.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t know the feeling of winning over just competing, that’s a dangerous thing,” Mitchell said. “I’ve tried to change my personality a little bit just to back them into a corner and see how they react, and then some days I’m the most positive person on this earth. As a coach you try to figure out which buttons to push and at what time.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has shown signs of improvement as the season has progressed. The Gauchos’ best showing of the year came just two games ago against CSU Bakersfield when they recorded season-highs with 64 points on 48.1 percent shooting. It was only the second time this season that they outshot their opponent from the field, but it still wasn’t enough to earn them their first win.</p>\n<p>“The conference is a lot better than it probably has been since I’ve been here,” Mitchell said. “We’ll have our hands full. it’s not going to get any easier but if we stick together and continue to grow from what we put on the court (that night) then we’ll be ok.”</p>\n<p>The return of small forward Taylor Farris could be beneficial to the Gauchos as they continue searching for a role player who can consistently perform at a high level. The freshman was named College Sports Madness’s Preseason Big West Freshman of the Year before an injury at the start of the season sidelined her for nearly two months.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue Big West play with a road game against Cal State Northridge on Thursday before they host Long Beach State on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii</strong> by Martin Cobos</p>\n<p>The University of Hawaii women’s basketball team already seems to have an uphill battle as it looks to build upon back-to-back third-place finishes in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors entered into conference play with an overall record of 8-5, but dropped a pair of conference games in opening weekend. The team lost to Cal Poly on Thursday by a score of 65-70 and lost to Cal State Northridge on Saturday by a score of 46-53. Hawaii now stands at 8-7 overall and sits at the bottom of the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we have had some really great moments in the preseason,” Head Coach Laura Beeman said. “ However, we have also had some woes in both the preseason and this opening conference weekend. I don’t feel like we’re playing our best basketball.”</p>\n<p>Beeman is in her third season as the program’s head coach and she is no stranger to success, having led the women’s basketball team to back-to-back appearances in the Women’s National Invitational Tournament (WNIT). As head coach, she has currently boasts an overall record of 42- 35 and a Big West conference record of 23-13.</p>\n<p>Hawaii has never opened conference play with back-to-back losses in Beeman’s tenure, so the road to a third consecutive WNIT is not going to be easy. The Rainbow Warriors will need to revitalize their offense if they look to bounce back.</p>\n<p>“We need to be able to make shots,” Beeman said. “We are missing easy shots right at the rim and we need to improve our field goal percentage.”</p>\n<p>Currently Hawaii sits with a combined field goal percentage of .404 and posts a dismal three-point field goal percentage of .255. In addition, the struggling offense averages nearly 17 turnovers per contest.</p>\n<p>However, bright spots do exist in Hawaii’s offense. Senior guard Shawna-Lei Kuehu leads the team in scoring and rebounding with 13.5 points per game and an average of 7.4 rebounds per game. Kuehu is also posting an impressive field goal percentage of .462 through 13 games.</p>\n<p>Senior guards Morgan Mason and Ashleigh Karaitiana round out Hawaii’s offensive attack as they are both averaging just above 10 points per game. Karaitina leads the team in steals with 25 and is averaging an impressive 33 minutes of playing time per contest.</p>\n<p>While the offense does show potential, it is Hawaii’s defense that keeps them in games. The team holds opponents to an average of just 66.1 points per game with a combined field goal percentage of .379. The Rainbow Warriors also force an average of 16.4 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>“Defensively we needed to make improvements and we have done that,” Beeman said. “We simply need to rebound the ball well and make sure that we are ready to make the big play when it comes time.”</p>\n<p>With six of seven losses this season having come by a margin of 10 points or less, Hawaii has largely had the opportunity to win every game. With such a tight field in conference, they key for the Rainbow Warriors could come down to simply converting those few extra shots.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is very familiar with each other in conference play and there are really no surprises,” Beeman said. “Some teams may be struggling, but for the most part every game is going to the wire and there won’t be many blowouts.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii will face UC Riverside this Saturday at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly </strong>by Edward Moss</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly women’s basketball team is off to a flying start with two wins from its first two matches of conference play. This is a team that sees itself as Big West title contenders with aspirations of getting better day after day.</p>\n<p>“We are a young team and we are really pleased with the progress so far,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “There’s a lot of teaching to be done, and we’re excited for conference play.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs are hungry for a Big West Championship after losing in the final last season at the hands of Cal State Northridge 73-58. After a strong preseason, the team is ready to go through conference play and hopes to give itself the opportunity to win the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs currently hold a 7-7 record overall after wins over Hawaii and UCSB in conference play. Cal Poly defeated the Rainbow Wahine 70- 65 as senior guard Ariana Elegado and sophomore forward Hannah Gilbert combined for 37 points. Freshman guard Dynn Leaupepe added 13 points to go along with six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defeated UCSB on Sunday 56-41 off a huge first half where the Mustangs scored 30 points to the Gauchos’ 15. It was the Mustangs’ eighth straight victory over the Gauchos as senior guard Kristen Ale led the team with 14 points.</p>\n<p>Elegado leads this young squad both on and off the court. The point guard was named the Big West Women’s Basketball Conference Player of the Week after leading the team’s offense in the first two games of conference play. She averaged 15 points, seven assists and four and a half rebounds per game during the week.</p>\n<p>Coming into Thursday’s match against Long Beach State, Elegado has 389 career assists, one shy of tying former All-American Laura Buehning for No. 2 in school history. She’s also 55 points back of No. 4 all-time at Cal Poly, as well as three three-pointers shy of a career total of 212, to tie her for the ninth-most in Big West history.</p>\n<p>“[Elegado’s] one of the best players in the conference,” Mimnaugh said. “She is a dynamic scorer and a player who is fun to coach, and fun to watch.”</p>\n<p>Other players to watch out for on the Mustang squad are Dynn Leaupepe’s twin sister, Lynn, as well as sophomore guard Rachel Koehler. Senior forward Taryn Garza looks to have a starting role, while junior guard Beth Balbierz will also hope to have an impact in either a starting or bench role.</p>\n<p>“We have to be strong on defense and rebounding,” Mimnaugh said. “We will have to limit turnovers to give us a chance to win … The Big West is a strong conference.”</p>\n<p>With a young team overall, led by three senior starters, the Mustangs will grow throughout this season with the younger players getting to learn from the elders. Expect this team to vie for a conference championship while leaning on its seniors amongst some growing pains.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p>After being voted No. 1 in the Big West Preseason Coaches’ Poll, Northridge had much to prove heading into the 2014-15 season. They have not disappointed so far, earning the conference’s second best overall record at 11-5 and starting 1-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Matadors are led by a pair of senior guards in Ashlee Guay and Janae Sharpe, both of whom were voted to the Preseason Media All-Conference Team. Guay is coming off a junior campaign in which she was named Big West Conference Player of the Year and Big West Tournament MVP, and she has not slowed down in her final year. Her 15.6 points per game are tops on the team, as well as her 4.3 assists per game and 1.4 steals.</p>\n<p>Backing up Guay is Sharpe, who comes in with 13.9 points per game of her own while pulling down more defensive rebounds than anyone on her team. Senior guard Cinnamon Lister is the third and final Matador averaging double-digits in scoring, doing her damage from the perimeter with team-highs of two three-pointers made per game on 39 percent shooting from long range, good for fifth best in the conference.</p>\n<p>While Northridge doesn’t score a particularly high amount of points, averaging the fifth- most points as a team in the conference at 66 a game, their defense has shined this year. The Matadors hold their opponents to just 60.1 points per game on a Big West-leading 36.8 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Their defense will need to remain strong as conference play gets open, as their offense has dropped off since the beginning of the new year. Despite an average of 66 points per game, they have not been as efficient in Big West games, averaging just 51 points a night on 32.7 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>After a 60-49 loss to UC Davis in its Big West opener, Northridge rebounded to defeat Hawaii 53-46 and get back to .500.</p>\n<p>Up next, the Matadors are set to play UCSB at home this Thursday before traveling to Cal Poly for a Saturday afternoon matchup.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis</strong> by Ryan Martin</p>\n<p>Returning all five starters from last season, the UC Davis women’s basketball team will look to improve on 2014’s fifth-place finish in the Big West. The Aggies finished up preseason play with a 5-7 record and split their first two conference games, going 1-1.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year Head Coach and former Aggie point guard Jennifer Gross will look to lead a talented squad with high hopes into the heart of their conference schedule. Senior forward Sydnee Fipps and junior forward Alyson Doherty lead the scoring for this high-powered offense averaging 16.0 and 13.5 points per game, respectively. The 5’10” Fipps was named to the preseason First Team All-Big West, and 6’3” Doherty was named to the All-Big West Conference Second Team after both achieved stellar 2013-’14 campaigns.</p>\n<p>On top of returning all five starters, the team lost just one player from last year’s squad. There is talent up and down the roster with a nice balance of upperclassmen (three seniors, five juniors) and lowerclassmen (two sophomores, five freshmen).</p>\n<p>One thing the Aggies know they can count on is their three-point shooting. Senior guard Kelsey Harris is shooting 53.2 percent from beyond the arc, which ranks number one in the entire nation. The success comes as no surprise to the Brea, California native as she finished last season with 86 three-pointers made, breaking a UC Davis record that stood since 1991. Harris’ sharpshooting forces defenses to play the perimeter tight which in-turn opens up scoring lanes for Fipps and Doherty.</p>\n<p>On the boards, junior forward Celia Marfone has been money for Davis, pulling down double-digit rebounds in each of her last three games including a season-high 12 against Long Beach State. The frontcourt duo of Marfone and Doherty, which is averaging 6.0 rebounds per game, give the Aggies a ton of confidence to continue launching three-balls, even if they don’t need it.</p>\n<p>The Aggies suffered a big loss when it was determined that junior guard Molly Greubel would be lost for the season due to wrist injury. Greubel led the Big West in free-throw percentage and ranked eighth in assists per game last season. Freshman guard Dani Nafekh has done a good job stepping in for Greubel and Davis will hope she can keep it up for the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>Although the lady Aggies’ preseason record was average at best, they faced a number of tough opponents including No. 1 UConn and No. 6 Stanford. Gross hopes that games against that type of competition will better prepare Davis for the meaningful Big West matchups. Davis will play CSUF on Saturday the 17th.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State </strong>by Sarah Stigers</p>\n<p>The Long Beach State women’s basketball team is coming in hot to Big West conference play after a nearly undefeated preseason.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have only suffered one loss this season, giving them a league-best 15-1 overall record and, with wins over UC Irvine and Davis this month, they bring a 13-game winning streak and a 2-0 Big West record into the weekend. Their only loss this season was an 85-90 overtime defeat against USC.</p>\n<p>Long Beach seems to be starting the climb out of a nine-year conference slump, as the Niners have not placed above fifth in the conference since their Big West title in 2006.</p>\n<p>Players like junior center Devin Hudson and sophomore guard Raven Benton are leading that charge. Hudson was honored as Big West Player of the Week on Dec. 15, and Benton was nominated for the same award this past week. Both Benton and teammate sophomore guard Anna Kim made the Big West All-Freshman team last season.</p>\n<p>Hudson currently leads the league in rebounds per game, snagging an average of 7.8 rebounds. Kim is also topping the 2014-’15 season charts, ranking third in the conference in field goal percentage with a 51.4 percent average.</p>\n<p>The Long Beach offense has managed to score over 70 points seven times this season and 85 points during three of those seven games. The 49er offensive power shows as they continue to put up high-scoring games and rank third in the conference in offensive rebounds, but what seems as a possible road bump in their success is their defense.</p>\n<p>The Niners have played nine games within a ten-point margin so far this season, eight of which were wins and two of which were forced into overtime. Though they currently top the conference in average steals, the team’s rebound average drops from a third ranking on offense to a sixth-best on defense. In addition, they are allowing 17.2 turnovers per game, which only puts an average 1.1 turnovers between the number one Long Beach State and last place UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>If this Long Beach team wants to continue its success, it is going to have to keep the ball in the hands of its offense, which means making sure it cleans up on the defensive glass more often and decreases its current average turnovers.</p>\n<p>Preseason lineups are different for every team, but for Long Beach to stay on top, the 49er defense has to be able to handle the strong conference offenses like that of Cal State Northridge, while continuing to force turnovers. Long Beach will come to Santa Barbara to play the Gauchos at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton</strong> by  Daniel Moebus-Bowles</p>\n<p>The CSUF Titans are off to a perfect start in Big West Conference play with a record of 1-0 after going 6-7 in their non-conference matchups. Now standing at an even .500, this Titan team has shown that it can play in any environment by just about splitting their wins between the road and home. Before starting their season, Fullerton was voted to place sixth in the conference, scoring 53 points in official media polls. They currently stand at third.</p>\n<p>This team is one that has played in some very close competitions, as their margin of points to allow to be scored is just -1.3 points. The team finds its way out of these close calls with its vast amount of three-point shots. On average, this team takes 24.4 threes a game and knocks down 32.5 percent of them. This equates to just under 40 percent of the Titans’ 61.8 points per game coming from behind the perimeter. Their efficient shooting from outside is nearly better than their overall field-goal percentage that sits at 39.6.</p>\n<p>Needless to say that this team can hit from outside and will take its talent into conference play, something it showed with its 30 three-point attempts in its first win over UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>With the long ball being a large part of their offense, the Titans take a huge part in giving themselves second opportunities on the glass. They average 12.6 offensive rebounds a game, which often lead to second chance points off of those missed perimeter shots.</p>\n<p>Ironic to their offensive power, the Titans are often burned on the defensive end by good three-point shooting teams. They allow 30.6 percent on all opponents’ perimeter shots as well as a 39.7 percent for all field goals. Luckily for them, they often force teams into blocked shots or turnovers, leading them perfectly into their offense.</p>\n<p>This team is without a doubt led by senior guard Chante Miles, who leads in scoring and assists and has been hot coming into Big West play. Miles averages 19.4 points, 5.1 assists and 3.3 rebounds per game for her Titans, and fuels the three-point stats that this team boasts. Miles herself is shooting 37.6 percent from behind the arch and has nearly knocked down 50 already this season.</p>\n<p>She was recently awarded Big West Player of the Week honors following two games in which she dominated. Miles posted a double-double of 18 points and 12 assists in the Titan win over UMKC followed by a 28-point, six-assist, four-rebound and three-steal performance in their win over Seattle.</p>\n<p>Miles will look to keep her Titans undefeated as they head on a road trip featuring tough teams in UC Irvine and UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine</strong> by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p>With Big West play underway, the young and inexperienced UC Irvine women’s basketball team finds itself at the bottom of the conference.</p>\n<p>“You don’t ignore wins or losses, or in our case, so many losses because you have to take ownership for what’s going on,” Head Coach Doug Oliver said. “But the challenge is that as young players this is a learning experience, every practice and every game.”</p>\n<p>The Anteaters lost seven seniors to graduation last year and now must deal with an entirely new lineup that consists of nine underclassmen and only two seniors.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine was projected to finish seventh in the Big West Preseason Media Poll. After finishing last season with a record of 17-15 and a trip to the Big West Tournament semifinals, UCI currently holds a 3-14 overall record and 0-2 league mark, with a Big West title looking increasingly unlikely.</p>\n<p>The key to UC Irvine’s success rides heavily on the play of sophomore forward Mokun Fajemisin who leads the team with averages of 11.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game. At 6’0”, Fajemisin has risen to the occasion all season with her feverish defense and aggressive shot blocking.</p>\n<p>Along with the stellar play of Fajemisin, senior guard Madison McKenney and senior forward Methlyn Onogomuho will be called upon to step up and provide leadership and production for the struggling Anteaters as they try and turn their season around during Big West play.</p>\n<p>“We need our two seniors to play good,” Oliver said. “These two know the expectations and they know what to do in our system.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the starting five for Irvine is freshman forward Brittany Glassow and junior guard Raelyn Cheung-Sutton. Glassow is averaging 4.8 points, 4.3 rebounds and 22.5 minutes in her freshman campaign while Cheung-Sutton leads the Anteaters with 69 assists.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters will have to grow up fast to have any success in conference play this year as more experienced teams will attempt to capitalize on the lack of height that Irvine has. UC Irvine has no one above 6’2” and is forced to rely on speed and effort to make up for this height disadvantage. Irvine first plays UCSB Jan. 29 at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside</strong> by Sean White</p>\n<p>​Certainly UC Riverside women’s basketball team has made improvements this season that can make it a true contender in the Big West Conference. The Highlanders are 10-6 with a 1-1 conference record, already giving them four more wins than last season’s 6-23 overall record.</p>\n<p>Riverside earned its best Division I start in school history with a 5-0 winning streak to begin the season and currently leads the Big West Conference in points per game with 70.3 while ranking second in the Big West in field goal percentage at 41.8 percent.</p>\n<p>​Nonetheless, UC Riverside’s effort defensively has been solid so far this season. The Highlanders allow opponents to average 62.2 points per game, shoot 38.1% from the field, 30.4% from behind the perimeter, 9.5 steals per game, and force 18.4 turnover per game.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, junior guard Brittany Crain is the team’s most valuable player, leading her team in almost every important statistical category. Crain averages a conference best 23.3 points per game, 2.4 steals per game, 7.1 rebounds per game, shoots 45.3 percent from the field, and is the team’s leading free throw shooter at 78.6 percent. She has been named the Big West Conference Athlete of the Week three times this season, two of those three honors coming in consecutive weeks. Additionally, Crain has scored thirty or more points in five games and has a season-high of 35 points.</p>\n<p>Although the majority of UCR’s workload falls on Crain’s shoulders, there are other players on the team who contribute to the Highlanders play as well. Last season’s Big West Conference Freshman of the Year, sophomore guard Simone DeCoud, has stepped up as one of UC Riverside’s most dependable players. DeCoud averages 12.9 points per game, shoots 41.4 percent from behind the three-point line, and leads the Highlanders in assists with four per game.</p>\n<p>Junior Annelise Ito is another player from Riverside’s arsenal of guards that plays a significant role in the Highlanders game on the court. Ito is third on the team in scoring, averaging 11.8 points per game, and is tied with Crain for being the team’s leading rebounder with 7.1 a game.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that has affected us in the last three years is our inability to stay healthy,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “We are on that thin line of if people are healthy, then we compete, and if people are not healthy, then we’re not as good.”</p>\n<p>Early in the season UC Riverside lost its size and power in the paint as it lost junior forward Réjane Verin, redshirt sophomore center Jazzmeen Williams, redshirt freshman center Dre’Mel Spencer, and senior forward Jamila Williams to injuries.</p>\n<p>“Having the flexibility and ability to adjust when it comes to injuries or illnesses when you’re not at full strength,” Margaritis explained. “Those are the things that in the past have influenced the outcomes of games.”</p>\n<p>Despite a 2-14 record last season that ranked last in the Big West Conference standings and kept UCR out of the Big West Tournament last season, the Highlanders have a convincing chance to compete in March for the first time since 2011.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside will be on the road for a conference matchup at Hawai’i this Saturday at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59820\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/59820/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59820\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/59820/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/59820/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/59820/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/59820/","id":418,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[417,416,415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Loses First Conference Game Versus CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"CSUN shot 56 percent from the field to defeat UCSB men's basketball last night, 74-63.

Using a 56 percent shooting performance, the Matadors started fast out of the gate and never looked back.</p>\n<p>“[Elliot] had a really good game. He stretched the floor out which was kind of difficult to guard,” senior guard Zalmico Harmon said. “We let them get going.

For UCSB, the loss is reminiscent of last season, when the Gauchos also lost their conference home opener against Cal Poly, resulting in the team losing out on the No. 1 seed in the league tournament.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, CSUN picks up its first win of conference season after losing its previous two games and improves to 5-13 overall and 1-2 in league. Santa Barbara understood the Matadors’ record was not indicative of the team’s talent, and experienced it firsthand.</p>\n<p>“I think talent wise they’re really good. They have four starters back from a team that lost in the Big West Championship last year,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “… If you overlook them, you’re crazy. So, as a coaching staff we did not overlook them. They’re a scary team.”</p>\n<p>What made the game even more difficult for UCSB was it was virtually without its best player in senior center Alan Williams. Williams came down with the flu prior to the game and it was apparent that he was not his usual self, as he did not possess the energetic dynamic he often brings.</p>\n<p>“It was a tough night for sure. I’m not exactly sure how [Williams] is feeling,” freshman guard Gabe Vincent said. “It’s tough to play sick, but he came out here and battled.”</p>\n<p>Williams finished with five points and seven rebounds, both a season-low. With Big Al only on the floor for 25 minutes, the Gauchos were severely undersized and outrebounded 34-23. Already a very tall team, CSUN used its height and athleticism to outmatch the Gauchos on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“Hicks, Maxwell and [Elliot] were pretty relentless on crashing the glass,” Harmon said. “Sometimes we didn’t block out and release … They are relentless athletes so they went out and got it.”</p>\n<p>After trimming the lead to five with a little over three minutes left, UCSB could not stop the Matadors from penetrating to the basket or hitting jumpers, and Northridge used the little time remaining to its advantage.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Vincent led the way in points with 15. In the first half, Vincent nailed three treys to keep UCSB within striking distance, leaving the Gauchos down 35-32 going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Northridge’s senior guard Stephan Hicks added 17 points and despite getting only six rebounds, CSUN’s best player in senior forward Stephen Maxwell, was a factor in the game.</p>\n<p>The only other player in double digits for UCSB was Harmon, who finished with 11 points and six assists.</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos have the difficult task of recovering from the loss and going on the road to play Long Beach State Saturday.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game against LBSU is scheduled for 4 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Matadors boast the conference’s second-best overall record at 11-5, 1-1.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I think it’s just small details that are hurting us,” junior guard Jasmine Ware said. “We’ve just got to come into practice every day and focus on the team that we’re playing next and focus on defense and getting better offensively.”</p>\n<p>While there have been signs of improvement for UCSB in recent games, it still has yet to figure out a winning formula now with one conference game under its belt. Sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe has emerged as a leader on the offensive side, leading the team with averages of 8.1 points per game and 41.1 percent shooting. Ware has provided a strong scoring punch at times as well, recording double-digit scoring performances in the Gauchos’ last two games and averaging a second-best eight points per game for her team.</p>\n<p>“Everyone knows that on any given night it could be their name called, but the problem is that right now we don’t have a person who has shown consistently that they will have the ability to step up in the game,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we ask our kids to take the easy shots so when there are contested shots you don’t feel as much pressure to knock those down.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB, one of the keys to lowering its -20.4 point differential will be its ability to shoot the ball and defend the three-point line. The Gauchos shoot just 31.8 percent from the field, compared to 44.9 for its opponents. The difference only gets worse from three-point range, as they have allowed teams to shoot an incredible 40 percent from downtown while shooting just 19.4 percent themselves.</p>\n<p>Consistently being outrebounded has also held the Gauchos back this season, with the team averaging nearly ten less rebounds per game than opponents.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing for us is that all year long we haven’t rebounded, and we’re turning it over a little more than I would like,” Mitchell said. “If you do both of those things against talented teams then it will be a long day and that’s two things we can control.”</p>\n<p>Coming off a 53-46 win over Hawaii last Saturday, the Matadors will host UCSB in their third consecutive home game to open up conference play tonight. A deep backcourt powers this team with senior guards Ashlee Guay, Janae Sharpe and Cinnamon Lister all averaging double-digit scoring. Guay, who leads the way with 15.6 points per game, is just two weeks removed from moving into No. 10 all-time in the Big West in career steals.</p>\n<p>“CSUN is the most experienced team in the conference. They have all five starters back and they were the team that represented us in the NCAA last year,” Mitchell said. “We know they’re extremely talented, they have the ability to score in all five positions. It’s one game at a time for us.”</p>\n<p>A 7-1 home record for Northridge could spell trouble for the Gauchos. However, UCSB’s inconsistent offense, which has been the main cause for its troubles, has surprisingly been more efficient on the road this season, averaging six points more per game on a higher shooting percentage while turning the ball over less.</p>\n<p>“We’re taking it one game at a time,” Ware said. “Northridge plays a lot of zone and it’s something that’s really good on their end so that’s one thing that we’re really focusing in on.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos will welcome an extremely hot Long Beach State to town. The 49ers are currently riding a 13-game winning streak, their longest since 1990-‘91, with their only loss this year coming in an overtime thriller against USC. Their outstanding play heading into Big West play has begun to earn them national recognition, as they tied for 35th in this week’s AP Women’s Basketball Poll.</p>\n<p>“I think they’ve proven in the pre-season that they have the skill, the talent, and two or three players coming off the bench to beat the BCS level schools,” Mitchell said. “They’re gonna mix it up defensively, so for us it will be a mindset of handling changing defenses.”</p>\n<p>Despite their record, Long Beach does not possess a particularly dominant offense, averaging just 60 points per game on just under 40 percent shooting. Instead, the 49ers rely on their defense to win games, holding opponents to just 23.6 percent shooting from three-point range, good for fourth in the nation. They are also very efficient with the ball, ranking 13th in the nation with a 6.6 turnover margin.</p>\n<p>“I think the 0-14 is what’s pushing us to keep going and keep trying to get that win,” Ware said. “Most teams probably would just lay down, but with the type of coaching staff we have and the type of people we are, we’re not going to give up that easy. We’ve still got a lot of games left.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are set to play Northridge tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Matadome and will host Long Beach State on Youth Night this Saturday at 2:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

With Big West play still in the beginning stages, the mindset of the Gauchos is to keep improving towards the end of the regular season, where the team wants to be playing its best basketball in preparation for the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“I think in some aspects we’ve improved, and I think in a lot of aspects we still got a lot of work to do,” Williams said. “That’s the beauty of conference. It’s a brand new season, and it’s a brand new opportunity to continue to improve to where you’re playing your best basketball in March.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has arguably the biggest stat-sheet stuffing big man in the nation with Big Al. Williams, last season’s Big West Player of the Year and AP All-American Honorable Mention, returns once again as the best player in the conference, without a doubt.</p>\n<p>His 21.3 points per game last year ranked 12­­­­­­th in the country and third all-time in program history for a single season. His game has only improved as he is currently averaging a league-leading 12.1 rebounds and 2.3 blocks; his 17.9 points per game rank him second in the conference as well.</p>\n<p>Not only is Big Al posting monster numbers on a consistent basis, he is doing it against top-level competition. Against Kansas, he went off for 22 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks. During the Gauchos’ trip to Oregon, he poured in 26 points and 12 rebounds on the Ducks.</p>\n<p>Don’t get confused though, UCSB is more than a one-man show. Yes, the Gauchos will most likely go as far as Big Al takes them, but they can beat you with more than just one player. One of the reasons many predict the team will make the NCAA Tournament is because of the supporting cast around Williams and the talent those players bring.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Michael Bryson is an athletic player that can play above the rim and has provided a few highlight reel dunks this season. As the team’s second-leading scorer averaging 13.5 points per game, Bryson is known for his three-point shooting prowess and is an important part of the inside-out game. UCSB will need him to be consistent as there are times he can be quiet from the floor.</p>\n<p>A new face this season is freshman guard Gabe Vincent, who earned a spot in the starting lineup since the first game. Despite his class standing, Vincent plays with the edge of an experienced player and has gelled quickly with the team.</p>\n<p>Vincent has showed a lot over the course of the non-conference season, at times even taking control of the scoring duties. Against Southern Methodist University, he nailed the clutch three-point shot with seconds left to force that game into overtime.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been so high on Gabe since the day we got the commitment from him,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He was a really good recruit for us. When we got him I said he’s going to be our starting off-guard … He’s everything we thought he was going to be.”</p>\n<p>Vincent battled a blister injury that kept him out of the Great Alaska Shootout tournament earlier, but has remained healthy since and will be needed down the stretch in the off-guard position.</p>\n<p>Playing alongside Vincent in the backcourt is senior guard Zalmico Harmon. Harmon commanded the point as well as any other player last season and ended with a 4.6-to-1.0 assist-to-turnover ratio, second-best in the entire Division I. So far, Harmon leads the squad in assists with 3.9.</p>\n<p>Although he primarily looks to get his teammates involved first, Harmon is also one of the best shooters on the team and can hit the three-point shot. Against Washington State, he led the team with 17 points on 3-4 shooting from beyond the arc.<br>\nUCSB’s bench is one of the deepest in the Big West and will be a key factor.</p>\n<p>“Being to be able to come off the bench with guys that go out there and put the ball in the basket is huge,” Big Al said. “I think they’re doing a good job to maintain or trying to elevate leads, and that’s what we need them to do.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have waited three years to see junior guard John Green take the court, and it’s been worth the wait. Injuries to foot and wrist have limited Green to only four games his first three years, however, Green has avoided the injury bug this year and has contributed in immense ways.</p>\n<p>Green is a versatile scorer that can attack the defense many different ways, either by facing up to shoot, attacking the basket or hitting the three. Think of Paul Pierce when comparing his game to an NBA player. His 10.5 points per game makes him one of three Gauchos to average in double-figures and third on the team overall. Defensively, Green will be relied to provide scrappy “D” and use his length to trouble opponents.</p>\n<p>Despite being healthy, Green must now get accustomed to playing significant minutes during an entire season.</p>\n<p>“Now there’s a grind of a season that he’s never been through before,” coach Williams said. “I think he’s learning to handle the grind of a season and that he has to learn to play through fatigue, and monotony of everyday practice is a new experience for him.”</p>\n<p>Point guard is a position of depth for UCSB. Besides Harmon, the Gauchos can experiment playing junior T.J. Taylor and sophomore Eric Childress. Taylor missed out all of last season after having surgery on both hips; prior to injury, he started 33 games his first two seasons and brings experience to the one. When left open, Taylor is a threat from the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Childress is a speedy player with handles. He can get to the basket and knock down floaters or even dunk the ball. He had a stellar game last Monday against Florida Gulf Coast where he provided a huge lift off the bench with his solid overall play.</p>\n<p>Two forwards on the roster that play complementary, yet important roles are juniors Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler. Brewe starts in the front court with Big Al while Beeler plays a backup role to Williams.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter Big West play battle-tested, playing the 22nd hardest schedule in the nation before non-conference season ended . UCSB’s first game of the year was against then-No. 5 Kansas on the road. In front of a raucous crowd, the Gauchos went neck-and-neck with the Jayhawks and were down by two points midway through the second half before eventually losing.</p>\n<p>UCSB then travelled for the Great Alaska Shootout during the Thanksgiving break, where they finished runner-up to Colorado St. in a game that went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>The team has definitely learned from its tough schedule what it takes to win, as evident in the Gauchos victory over rival Cal Poly in their Big West opener last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Down by 10 points with seven minutes left, Santa Barbara closed the game on a 20-5 run to steal the victory from Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“The last six minutes of basketball is when we really started to make a dent to what they were doing,” Bryson said. “I think that speaks a lot about the non-conference games really just teaching us a lesson.”</p>\n<p>After tonight’s game against Cal State Northridge, the schedule doesn’t get easier for UCSB. They play Saturday on the road versus Long Beach State before returning home next week for two home games.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s home game against CSUN is scheduled for 7 p.m. with Saturday’s contest versus Long Beach beginning at 4 p.m., and will be available to view on ESPN 3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine Anteaters </strong>by Mark Salay</p>\n<p>The UC Irvine men’s basketball team was all but a lock to win the Big West last season. They entered as the No. 1 seed and poised to make the program’s first appearance in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>That dream was put on pause as the eventual league champions, Cal Poly, upset the Anteaters in the semifinals. Flash-forward to now: Irvine returns four starters and the conference’s defensive player of the year with hopes of finishing off what it couldn’t last season.</p>\n<p>UCI has been picked to win the Big West again, but has split two games to start conference, losing to Long Beach State and cruising to an easy win versus UC Riverside. During non-conference, UCI went 8-8.</p>\n<p>A significant reason for the team’s losses can be attributed to two key injuries in sophomore center Mamadou Ndiaye and sophomore guard Luke Nelson.<br>\nListed at 7’6”, 300 lbs., Ndiaye is the tallest active player in Division I and the conference’s reigning defensive player of the year after setting the league record for most blocks in a season with 106. His presence in the paint is enough to change the game because of his height and length (his wingspan is over 8’3”).</p>\n<p>Ndiaye has missed nine games this year, including the conference opener, but returned last Saturday against UC Riverside in a 10 point, three rebound performance. Ndiaye is not the best option on offense since his lack of coordination causes him to turn the ball over. However, he comes into the season with many facets of his game much improved.</p>\n<p>Nelson, last season’s Big West Conference Freshman of the Year, has played in only 10 games so far because of injury.</p>\n<p>He is coming off a season where he averaged 11.1 points per game and can potentially make huge strides on the offensive end when he comes back. For the Anteaters, it will be imperative for Nelson to continue improving his efficiency on that end.</p>\n<p>Playing in the backcourt alongside Nelson is junior Alex Young, Big West Conference Freshman of the Year in the year prior to Nelson. Both Nelson and Young competed for Great Britain in the European U20 Championship during the summer and had time to develop more chemistry on the floor. Together, the two form one of the strongest duos in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCI’s next game is tonight versus Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach 49ers</strong> by Sarah Stigers</p>\n<p>A rich history of Long Beach State men’s basketball is hoping to be salvaged as this year’s team attempts to climb out of its preseason hole entering Big West play this month.</p>\n<p>Starting the conference season with a 7-11 overall record, the team looks forward to a more fruitful January coming off a seven-game losing streak following in December. However, Long Beach has already won two of its three games this month, landing it the seventh seed in the Big West so far with a 1-1 record. One of the team’s losses included a one-point loss to nationally ranked San Diego State.</p>\n<p>Coming off of not only a third-place 2014 season finish, but three previously consecutive first-place conference titles in 2011, 2012 and 2013, players like senior guard Mike Caffey started to turn it on in past weeks to climb the conference ladder.</p>\n<p>Caffey is starting the Big West season off with a Big West Player of the Week award this week. He is coming off a successful 2014 campaign in which he received Big West first team recognition.</p>\n<p>Though Caffey’s recent success translated into a win over UC Irvine and a close overtime loss against UC Davis, the team is still feeling the loss of 2014 Big West honorable mention Dan Jennings. Eleven of the 18 49er players on this year’s roster are either sophomores or freshmen.</p>\n<p>Though the team’s youth may be seen as a set back, the 49ers still maintain an undefeated 4-0 record at home, but fall short on the road, only winning one of 11 road games. However, even after an up-and-down November, alternating between a win and loss every other game, half of the team’s final scores have ended in a 10-point margin — five of which ended in a Long Beach loss.</p>\n<p>Growing experience will be an important aspect of this season for the 49ers. With more time spent on the court, the young team will only get better as it adjusts to road play and learns how to finish crucial plays during those close matches, something they are showing signs of so far this January.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is currently fourth in the conference in field goal percentage, just trailing UC Santa Barbara, with a 43.6 percent average. They also fall just behind the Gauchos in three-point percentage, again ranking fourth in the conference with a 37.5 percent average.</p>\n<p>As for this past year’s Big West tournament, the 49ers entered at the third seed. During the first round quarterfinals. LBSU defeated Cal State Fullerton 66-56, but ultimately the Niners fell to CSUN in the second round semi-finals 82-77.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will play at home the next two games against Cal Poly on Thursday and UC Santa Barbara on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly Mustangs </strong>by Edward Moss</p>\n<p>Coming off its unexpected berth in the 2014 NCAA Tournament, the Cal Poly men’s basketball team hopes to repeat its success and make it back to the “Big Dance” in 2015.</p>\n<p>Last season was the greatest in Mustang basketball history. The team became the first No. 7 seed to win the men’s Big West Conference Tournament, and then the team continued its run with a victory over fellow No. 16 seed Texas Southern before losing to No. 1 seed Wichita State. Last season’s success has made the team hungry to make it back to the NCAA Tournament this year.</p>\n<p>“It was our goal last year to make it to the NCAA [Tournament],” Head Coach Joe Callero said. “It helped us with recruiting and it is our goal to make it back to the ‘Dance’ this year.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs comes into today with an 8-6 record after going 7-5 in preseason games and 1-1 in conference play. Their biggest match from the preseason was a loss at the hands of No. 8 Gonzaga, 63-50. Cal Poly’s next match is tomorrow night against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>In their first game against a Big West opponent, the Mustangs defeated Hawaii 61-57 in overtime. Junior forward Brian Bennett scored a season-high 20 points to lead Cal Poly in a game where the team led by seven at halftime, but allowed Hawaii to get back into the game before winning in overtime.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly then hosted rival UCSB and lost 50-45 in a scrappy game where each team played very tough defense. Junior forward Joel Awich lead the Mustangs with 13 points, but they were not able to contain the Gauchos in the second half while attempting to switch from a zone defense to a man-to-man defense.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly prides itself on its defense and taking care of the ball well. Nationally, the squad ranks No. 1 in fewest turnovers and statistically it has the best defense in the Big West so far this season.</p>\n<p>“I’m really pleased with this team. They’re tough and they like each other,” Callero said. “We have a really good individual and team defense, but we have to be able to shoot the ball well in order to win.”</p>\n<p>With the experience this team gained from making it to the NCAA Tournament last season, the Mustangs should be included in the conversation as contenders to win the Big West again this year. With Bennett, the leading scorer in the conference thus far, Awich and junior guards David Nwaba and Reese Morgan, this squad looks formidable as conference play picks up.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing is to keep improving,” Callero said. “We are a very balanced team and we hope to improve every week and make it back to the ‘Big Dance.’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge Matadors </strong>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</p>\n<p>Led by an experienced basketball mind in second-year Head Coach Reggie Theus, the Cal State Northridge Matadors came into Big West Conference play last weekend with a record of just 4-13 overall. They have since taken two more losses to start off conference play 0-2.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ record, being well under .500, is not an extremely accurate representation of their strength, as they have played tough teams including then No. 16 San Diego State, No. 4 Louisville and No. 2 Arizona. Preseason Big West polls had this squad finishing fourth overall in conference with one first-place vote received as well.</p>\n<p>This team is one that clearly struggles when it is away from The Matadome with a record of 0-9 as the away team this season.</p>\n<p>The Matadors started Big West play with a pair of losses on the road to UC Davis and Hawai’i University and will end their three-game trip looking for their first road win with a matchup at Santa Barbara tomorrow. They will not be a team to pass over by any means when they return home for a four-game homestand, which should definitely boost their Big West standing.</p>\n<p>Northridge possesses an all-around team, scoring an average of 65.4 points a game and allowing just about 72.5 points. Theus runs a system that favors inside looks, which is made evident by their microscopic 9.3 3-point attempt average over the course of this season.</p>\n<p>Rather than settling for long distance shots, the Matadors’ patience on the offensive leads to more high percentage shots and it shows with their 42.4% field goal efficiency. However, they do not always get to take these good looks as they average 14.1 turnovers a game.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this is a dangerous team to face if the Matadors can find themselves in rhythm and are able to take care of the ball. On the defensive end, they allow a comparable field goal percentage as their opponents clock in around 42.8 percent and can be an exhausting team to play against as they push just over 6.4 steals and blocks every game. For this team, winning games seems to be more about not beating themselves as opposed to just beating the other team.</p>\n<p>On the court, the Matadors are led by a pair of seniors named Steve. Seniors Stephan Hicks and Stephen Maxwell top the team in scoring, dropping averages of 17.4 and 15.9 points per game. The guard-forward mix works out perfectly for Northridge as it has true threats on both parts of the offense, in a system that is designed to get high percentage looks at all costs. They are the only two players that on average take over 10 attempts a game but both of them are near or above 50 percent shooting as well with the inside and mid-range looks that they take.</p>\n<p>Maxwell serves a second purpose on the floor as well as he leads the team in rebounding, reeling in around eight boards per game. As a guard, Hicks ranks third on this list with 5.2 per game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii Rainbow Warriors </strong>by Martin Cobos</p>\n<p>As conference play begins, the University of Hawaii men’s basketball team will look to improve upon its fourth-place finish in the Big West last year.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors have been no strangers to adversity this season as the program announced in October that Head Coach Gib Arnold and Assistant Coach Brandyn Akana would be relieved of their coaching duties immediately. Assistant Coach Benjy Taylor would come to be named the interim head coach three days after the initial announcement.</p>\n<p>In Taylor’s first year as Head Coach, he has led Hawaii to an impressive non-conference record of 13-5. This marks the most non-conference victories in the school’s history and the record sits at the top of the Big West entering into conference play.</p>\n<p>“It has been a whirlwind experience for me as well as the team,” Coach Taylor said. “I got the job about a week before our first exhibition game and didn’t have the benefit of the full type of season. It was a tough transition, but we have all adjusted and responded.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii has gone 1-1 so far in conference play, losing to Cal Poly 57-61 last Wednesday in an overtime thriller before defeating Cal State University Northridge on Saturday by a score of 83-68.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly was such a tough physical game,” Coach Taylor said. “In over 20 years of coaching, I don’t think I’ve been involved in such a physical game. We are beat up, but have a young team with a short memory, so we are going to bounce back and we don’t have time to dwell on this.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii owes a large portion of its success this season to its strong physical defense. Their opponents have averaged a mere 67.3 points a game and post a shooting percentage just above .400.</p>\n<p>Hawaii also thrives off creating turnovers and forcing its opponent to make mistakes. Their opponents are averaging 17.3 turnovers per contest and Hawaii holds a turnover margin of +3.4. In addition, the Rainbow Warriors average an outstanding 9.6 steals per game.</p>\n<p>“The key to putting up this record was, for the most part, that we defended every night and played hard every night,” Taylor said. “We have struggled at times offensively, but our defense has really kept us in games.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, Hawaii is led by sophomore guard Aaron Valdes. Valdes has posted an average of 16.3 points per game and is shooting above .500 through 18 games this season.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Garrett Nevels is also a main contributor to Hawaii’s offensive attack. Nevels is averaging 11.4 points per game and posts a shooting percentage of .400 though 16 games. Both Nevels and Valdes average over 30 minutes per game and make up the core foundation of this Hawaii team.</p>\n<p>The key for Hawaii in conference play will be to generate offense and convert on easy looks. While Hawaii boasts a rather impressive shooting roster, missed shots from close range have hindered this offense in close games.</p>\n<p>“When you head into conference play, you have to be more in tune with personnel and scouting,” Taylor said. “You just have to be focused and we are going to have to play better offensively.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii will face UC Riverside on Saturday at 8:30 pm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis</strong> by Ryan Martin</p>\n<p>After posting a 28-65 record in his first three seasons at UC Davis, men’s head basketball coach Jim Les may have finally found the winning formula. The team has been phenomenal stringing together a 12-3 record to start the season.</p>\n<p>The Aggie’s also opened up Big West play by defeating Northridge and powerhouse Long Beach State to claim sole possession of first place in the conference.<br>\nUCD has talent all over the court, but this team will go only as far as senior guard Corey Hawkins takes them. Through 15 games, the 6’3” Hawkins is leading the team in scoring, rebounding, assists, and steals while shooting an uncanny 49 percent on three-pointers. Hawkins, son of former NBA All-Star Hersey Hawkins, also leads the entire Big West conference in scoring and three-point percentage, while his numbers in assists, steals, field-goal percentage, and free throw percentage all rank amongst the top five.</p>\n<p>While Hawkins has been consistently great throughout his career at Davis, the return of senior forward Josh Ritchart has proven to be crucial to the team’s success. Last year, the 6’9” Ritchart led the team in scoring and rebounding before a lower leg injury ended his season, leaving the team without a viable second option on offense. With Ritchart fully healthy and Hawkins firing on all cylinders, the Aggies have been virtually unstoppable thus far.</p>\n<p>If opponents are somehow able to subdue the one-two punch of Hawkins and Ritchart, they must then find a way to deal with junior forwards J.T. Adenrele and Josh Fox. Adenrele, the Aggie’s bona-fide rim protector, missed all of last season due to injury.</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Adenrele tied Davis’s single season record for blocked shots with 46, and his return has fortified the team’s interior defense.</p>\n<p>Fox, a transfer student from San Francisco City College, has emerged as the team’s third scoring option behind Hawkins and Ritchart. Although he is not a threat to score from distance, the 6’6” junior consistently finds ways to get to the rim, averaging 10 points per game while shooting 66 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Davis has always been able to put points on the board, but defense will be key in determining this team’s fate. With the return of Adenrele and Ritchart, it is no surprise opponents are scoring a mere 62 points per game on the Aggie’s this year, down from 72.2 last season.</p>\n<p>One area in which the Aggie’s will look to improve is playing on the road. While the team has gone undefeated at home (8-0), their play has been somewhat mediocre on the road (4-3). Following last season’s 1-13 away record, performing outside of their home confines will be a primary focus of head coach Les.</p>\n<p>For a team that has finished in last place in the Big West three out of the last four seasons, the 12-3 start may look like a fluke. But with the return of key veterans and Hawkins playing at an elite level in his final season, the Aggie’s certainly have a chance to do something special.</p>\n<p>Davis will look to remain unbeaten in the Big West Thursday, when they travel to Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside Highlanders </strong>by Sean White</p>\n<p>The questionable aspect of UC Riverside men’s basketball team this season has been its consistency. The Highlanders have won some key games, but the team’s inability to finish has cost them in the second half.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside is currently 8-8, with a 1-1 Big West conference record. Home games have been an advantage for Riverside this season, as the Highlanders are 7-1 when playing on their home court, but have struggled while playing on the road, going 1-7.</p>\n<p>“I think if you look at college basketball all over the country, it’s difficult to go on the road and win,” Head Coach Dennis Cutts said. “Five of those eight games have been right down to a possession or two.”</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s performance on the road this season, junior forward Taylor Johns and junior guard Jaylen Bland have emerged as UCR’s primary role players. Nearly averaging a double-double, Johns serves as the team’s focal point of its offensive game plan. He ranks fifth in scoring in the Big West, averaging 17.1 points per game and ranks second in both rebounding and blocks in the league with 8.7 rebounds per game and 1.9 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>As UC Riverside’s big man in the paint, Johns earned his first career Big West Men’s Basketball Athlete of the Week award in the week of Dec. 1-7, 2014. During that week of games, he averaged 20.5 points per game, 6.0 rebounds per game, and 2.0 blocks per game while shooting 73.9 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Jaylen Bland is a transfer guard from College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, California where he was selected to first team all-league and first team all-state. Bland has been a nice addition to the UC Riverside roster. Averaging 14.3 points per game, shooting 39.2 percent from the field and 39.8 percent from behind the three-point line, while leading the Highlanders in total steals with 17 this season.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside averages 68.3 points per game, shoots 43.2 percent from the field, and 36.1 percent from behind the perimeter. Defensively, the Highlanders allow 66.2 points per game, but play great on-ball defense ranking second in steals in the Big West averaging 6.8 steals per game.</p>\n<p>“We have got a team that will play through every possession, play you for 40 minutes and never feel like we’re really out of a game,” Cutts said. “I think at times when we have both ends of the floor together we can be a very good basketball team.”</p>\n<p>Last season the Highlanders ended with a 10-21 overall record and were 5-11 in conference games. They earned the No. 8 seed in the Big West Tournament but were knocked out of contention by the No. 1 seeded Anteaters in the quarterfinals.</p>\n<p>“This team is built a little differently than last year,” Cutts said. “We have the ability to shoot it better off multiple spots, more versatility defensively, can switch and do things more at the other end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>In just his second year as head coach, Dennis Cutts is confident and hopeful that his team will continue to progress throughout the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a ways to go,” Cutts said. “This program is chipping away and trying to find a way to get better players and add more players to the program. I think it’s just a process.”</p>\n<p>UC Riverside will host UC Davis tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton </strong><strong>Titans </strong>by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p>In an up-and-down preseason characterized by multiple winning streaks and losing streaks, the Cal State Fullerton men’s basketball team finds itself in eighth place in the conference and winners of five of its last six games.</p>\n<p>Fullerton was projected to finish eighth in the Big West Preseason Media Poll; however, they look to be a dark horse headed into conference as they are playing like anything but underdogs.</p>\n<p>After a subpar 2013-14 campaign in which the Titans finished 11-20 and lost in the first round of the Big West tournament, Fullerton is on the upswing with a record of 8-8 under second-year Head Coach Dedrique Taylor.</p>\n<p>The Titans are led by the electrifying play of senior guard Alex Harris who was honored as a Big West Honorable Mention player last season. Harris currently leads the Titans with 16.1 points, 3.4 assists and 1.3 steals per game.</p>\n<p>“Alex is everything,” Taylor said. “His energy, effort and basketball IQ offensively and defensively dictate how we play and he is rubbing off on other players and giving them purpose.”</p>\n<p>Harris is complemented by two of the Titans’ key transfers in junior guard Lanerryl Johnson and senior forward Moses Morgan. Morgan transferred from DePaul after the 2013-14 season and Johnson transferred from Central Arizona Junior College where he averaged 18.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Putting Alex at point guard has changed how our entire team has been playing as a whole,” Taylor said. “Role players like Laneryl and Moses are beginning to develop and understand their roles to help us win games.”</p>\n<p>Experience is certainly not a weakness of this team as seven of the 11 Titans to play this year are upperclassmen, although sophomore forward Joe Boyd has been a key player as well for Fullerton, as he has started all but one game this year.</p>\n<p>With six different players listed at 6’7” or taller, the Titans have been able to rely heavily on stingy defense and rebounding to propel them to success.</p>\n<p>The Titans averaged 72.6 points during a five-game winning streak heading into conference play, while only allowing opponents to score 56.4 points over that same span.

The Mustangs’ zone defense limited various offensive opportunities for the Gauchos as they shot 28.6 percent from the field and 15 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“Tonight we were just really stagnant,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Other guards have to step up and be willing to get in the gaps and either knock down mid-range jumpers or open it up for other players.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly was successful offensively as they shot 44.9 percent from the field, while shooting 33.3 percent from behind the perimeter. Senior guard Kristen Ale led Cal Poly with 14 points, giving her team a spark, shooting 3-5 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>UCSB was not able to contain Cal Poly’s offense as it ended the first half on a 24-9 run, giving the Mustangs a 30-15 lead at halftime. Although UCSB faced a double-digit deficit entering the second half, they played with great effort. The Gauchos scored 26 points and allowed 26 points in the second half as they traded buckets with the Mustangs early in the half.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Jasmine Ware scored a game-high 15 points on 6-13 shooting from the field. UCSB managed to earn 10 steals off of Cal Poly’s 20 turnovers but were unable to capitalize on those opportunities.</p>\n<p>“We had 10 steals but we didn’t turn those into a lot of second-chance points or transition points,” Mitchell added. “We need to turn those miscues by our opponents into points for us on the opposite end of the court.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Onome Jemerigbe scored five points and led the Gauchos with five assists.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos are 0-14, the beginning of conference play has somewhat given UCSB a new beginning to the season, in hopes of making it to the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road Thursday at Cal State Northridge for their second conference game in hopes of earning their first win of the season.</p><div

More importantly, we were able to play good defense the whole game and kept grinding and grinding,” senior center Alan Williams said. “Those are the type of road wins you need, especially in conference.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara moves to 1-0 in Big West play and 8-7 overall while Cal Poly drops to 8-6 overall and 1-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fell into an early hole starting in the first half, but with seven minutes left and the score 40-30 in favor of Cal Poly, UCSB’s stagnant offense suddenly came to life with scoring from junior guard Michael Bryson and Vincent.</p>\n<p>Vincent became the aggressor on offense starting with completing an and-one play, and then hitting a three to pull the Gauchos to within seven with nine minutes left. Vincent’s scoring coupled with the energetic play of sophomore guard Hunter Ford helped Santa Barbara get back in the game.</p>\n<p>Ford, a walk-on who played a total of 16 minutes for the entire season prior to the game, was a much needed spark plug off the bench. Ford played 12 minutes and provided solid defense and rebounding, helping cut the lead to three after knocking down a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>“I think it was huge for him to come in and step in the way he did, and really spark us off the bench,” Williams said. “He’s a great shooter and I think that showed last night that [Head Coach Bob Williams] was able to put him in there and trust him.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally broke through with three straight three’s beginning with a Bryson shot that tied the game, followed by Vincent giving the Gauchos their first lead since the 14 minute mark of the first half. Bryson delivered the dagger with a minute left by draining an open three from the corner that put the Gauchos on top 46-42 and permanently gave the Gauchos the lead.</p>\n<p>“I think at that point we saw the momentum shifting and felt more in control, because at that point we had already gotten a couple stops defensively,” Bryson said. “You can tell [Cal Poly’s] demeanor was starting to fade. The momentum was starting to switch on our favor.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hung in after a slow start to begin the second half. An 8-0 run by Cal Poly in the first five minutes and a quick three fouls committed by Big Al increased the Mustangs’ lead and sent UCSB’s primary scorer to the bench. It was then that Santa Barbara opted for a rotation of shooters on the floor to knock down the three-point shots that helped it get back into the game.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs had the lead for a majority of the game by forcing the Gauchos to play out of sync. Cal Poly imposed its own style of play, controlling the tempo and turning the game into a slow-downed, physical affair.</p>\n<p>“Going into it we knew what kind of game it would be — a low scoring, grind-it out game,” Williams said. “I think we just really focused in and knew what we had to do in order to pull that game out.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly could have widened its 23-20 halftime lead, but the team shot only 25 percent in the first half to keep UCSB within striking distance, despite creating problems on defense.</p>\n<p>Vincent led all scorers with 15 points and junior forward Joel Awich led the Mustangs with 13. Bryson, who had a quiet first half, added eight points, all coming in the second half.</p>\n<p>“In the first half I was in some type of a rut, I owe a lot of that to the Cal Poly defense and them slowing us with that 1-3-1 [defense], which really threw me out of whack,” Bryson said. “My teammates stayed resilient and kept us in it, and put me in position in order to knock down big shots.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defended Big Al well, limiting him to only six points on seven attempts in the first half. It was not until later that Williams found his rhythm, especially on the block where he finished with 15 rebounds to go along with nine points.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for its first home conference game this Thursday when it takes on Cal State Northridge, and then travels to Long Beach State Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/","id":450,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[449,448,447],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Battle-tested Gauchos Square Off Against Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M-Basketball-Stephen-Manga_web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M-Basketball-Stephen-Manga_web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Men's basketball is ready to kick-off the Big West season against Cal Poly with hopes of avenging last year's loss in the conference tournament.

The best player in the conference had fouled out with seven minutes left in the Big West Tournament quarterfinal, with his team on the verge of having its season end at the hands of Blue-Green rival, Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>UCSB was run out of the building, losing 69-38. It was the team’s worst loss of last season, a season that had promise of ending in a conference title. Ten months later, the Gauchos have a chance of exorcising their demons when they open Big West play Saturday against Cal Poly on the road.</p>\n<p>“There’s no love between the coaches and players, it’s a real rivalry. We’re going to treat it like one, and really go out and be the aggressors,” junior guard John Green said. “Cal Poly is a real defensive, physical team. We want to come out being physical as well, and show them that we can grind it out and win the Gaucho way.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara enters the contest with a 7-7 record overall and winner of its last two games, with wins over Vermont and Florida Gulf Coast. In each of those games, the team showed focus and a commitment to defense, a good sign heading into conference play.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been ready. These past two wins at home have given us an energy boost heading into Cal Poly,” Green said. “It’s our first game in conference and we know what happened last year in the Big West Tournament. We’re really active and excited to play against this team in their house.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal Poly stands at 8-5, coming out on top in six of its last eight games. The Mustangs began conference yesterday against Hawaii as the team won a tough game, 61-57.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to play sound basketball for it to capitalize on whatever errors the Mustangs commit. Cal Poly currently leads the nation in fewest turnovers per game and on eight occasions it has kept turnovers to nine or less.</p>\n<p>Besides taking advantage of turnovers, it will be critical for UCSB to control the glass considering four of the Mustangs’ five losses have come when they lost the rebound battle.</p>\n<p>“We got to keep them off the glass,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In wins they average eight more rebounds than their opponents, in losses they get outrebounded. That’s a key factor for them.”</p>\n<p>How effective the Gauchos can block out for Big Al might decide this game. Williams, this week’s conference Player of the Week, is averaging 18.6 points and 11.9 rebounds for the season. Coming off consecutive double-doubles, Big Al heads into the contest 30 rebounds away from 1,000 for his career, which would make him only the fifth player in conference history to reach that milestone.</p>\n<p>A major contributor this season has also been Green. Injuries to his foot and wrist limited him to only four games in three years, but now that he is healthy, Green has been a key player off the bench averaging 11.1 points per game and scoring in double-digits in 10 of the last 13 games.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos do come out on top in this Blue-Green rivalry game, it would be only their second conference-opening win in the last seven years.</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday at the Mott Athletics Center is set for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of January 8, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily

looking to pick up its first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Although they have struggled mightily in the first two months of the season, the 0-13 Gauchos have some momentum coming off their strongest performance yet on Tuesday in a 64-74 loss against CSU Bakersfield. The Mustangs enter having just defeated that same Bakersfield team 71-66 to end their four-game losing streak. At 5-7, Cal Poly is tied for the sixth-best record in the Big West heading into conference play.</p>\n<p>“The conference is a lot better than it probably has been since I’ve been here,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We’ll have our hands full. It’s not going to get any easier but I definitely feel that if we stick together and continue to grow then we’ll be okay.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Against Bakersfield, behind career-performances from sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe and freshman forward Chaya Durr, the Gauchos shot 48.1 percent from the field on their way to a season-high 64 points.</p>\n<p>“With our kids, the key is the effort, the body language, the shot selection, and everyone just playing free and letting the ball move,” Mitchell said. “Those things are important, and the numbers on the offensive side (against Bakersfield) are good for our confidence.”</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe scored a career-best 16 points in that game, improving her team-leading averages of 8.4 points per game on 42.7 percent shooting and 3.4 assists per game. Durr added a personal-best 15 points of her own and tallied a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to carry over its hot shooting if it is going to find success against the Mustangs, who average over 24 points more per game than the Gauchos. Keeping up in the scoring department will be the key, as UCSB has scored over 60 points just one time this season. The more formidable offense of Cal Poly has done so in 11 consecutive games.</p>\n<p>“We have to come out with some fire and energy,” Jemerigbe said. “We need to play to our strengths, lock up on defense and communicate.”</p>\n<p>Another significant factor for the Gauchos will be trying to stop a solid three-point shooting team in Cal Poly, which shoots 35.1 percent from beyond the arc.UCSB has struggled to stop the three-ball this season, most recently allowing Bakersfield to shoot 11-21 as it used long-distance shooting to take over the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will primarily have to try to find a way to stop Ariana Elegado, who provides a large chunk of her team’s offense. The senior guard is the only player on the team averaging double-digits in scoring with 15.6 a game. The San Diego native is also the top threat in the three-point game as she averages 2.5 makes a game on 38.5 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side for UCSB, balance continues to be the story with a different leading scorer seemingly every night.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Jasmine Ware owns the second-highest points per game average at 7.5 a game while leading her team with 1.6 steals per game. Senior center Clair Watkins adds 7.2 PPG of her own while holding down the middle with team-highs of 1.9 blocks and 6.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The game is set to tip-off at 2 p.m. this Saturday in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of January 8, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59451\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/big-west-play-begins-in-first-blue-green-outing-of-2015/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59451\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/big-west-play-begins-in-first-blue-green-outing-of-2015/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/big-west-play-begins-in-first-blue-green-outing-of-2015/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/big-west-play-begins-in-first-blue-green-outing-of-2015/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/big-west-play-begins-in-first-blue-green-outing-of-2015/","id":486,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[485,484,483],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":27,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
