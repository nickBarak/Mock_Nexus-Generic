The whole team was really disappointed, so we’re excited to play them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB earned their trip to the Honda Center after a come-from-behind victory at UC Irvine, in which the Gauchos allowed the Anteaters to score just 51 points, while on the offensive end, five players tallied at least eight points.</p>\n<p>“We have to keep our confidence up,” Zornig said. “We have to stick together as a team and keep playing how we’re playing. If we get it done on the defensive end, we’ll win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to maintain its tenacious league-leading defense, which allows teams 52 points per game, because the Tigers love to score. They average 68.1 points per game, second in the Big West, and feature three of the top 12 scorers in guards Kendall Rodriguez, Erica McKenzie and Gena Johnson. The three average 35.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day it’s about us and we just have to do what we do best,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Pacific is also third in conference in three-point shooting, hitting 32.9 percent of its threes and averaging 6.4 treys a game.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a threat from behind the arc too: senior forward Kelsey Adrian. Adrian ranks fifth in the Big West in three-point shooting (36.9 percent) and knocked down crucial threes in the last game against Irvine.</p>\n<p>In both games against Pacific, UCSB faltered down the stretch, allowing the Tigers to go on large unanswered runs. The first matchup was played evenly until Pacific went on a 10-0 run to seal the game. The second game saw a terrible performance by the Gauchos. After going down early, UCSB closed the gap to single digits, but then watched Pacific mount a 18-0 run in the second half. UCSB had just 15 points in the second period.</p>\n<p>Despite the inconsistency this season, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell has a better plan in mind that will make her team forget any loss and allow the two seniors to leave a great legacy.</p>\n<p>“When I knew realistically we were back in the corner as far as winning the conference this year and that’s what they came in here understanding as seniors, I [told them] that there would be no bigger legacy than being the surprise team, being the Cinderella story, winning the conference tournament, and having a chance to make a run at the NCAA’s,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45561\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45561\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/","id":741,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[740,739,738],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ready For Awaiting Challenge in Anaheim","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The following is the latest installment of the Nexus Sports athlete blog series, featuring Chrisitan Peterson, a senior forward on the men’s basketball team.   So after a great senior night and...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>The following is the latest installment of the Nexus Sports athlete blog series, featuring Chrisitan Peterson, a senior forward on the men’s basketball team.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So after a great senior night and closing out league at 12-4, we are now headed down to Anaheim for the Big West tourney as the number three seed. Fullerton is the number two seed after their win over Long Beach but second or third seed doesn’t make much difference because we would still play each other before the championship game. Senior night was great. Probably the most fun I’ve had playing in a game my entire career here at UCSB. We had a substantial lead the entire game and that allowed us to play more relaxed and have fun with each other more. This next weekend can either make or break our season. The past two years we have upset Long Beach in the final to get the automatic bid to the NCAA tourney and we will have to do it again if we hope to make it back for a third consecutive year. We are starting to play some of the best basketball we have played all year long and it couldn’t be at a better time. Everything changes around tourney time. Attitudes become more focused, games become more physical and coaches will lose their shit easier. Beach crushed it in conference losing only their last game to Fullerton and they will be heavily favored to win it again. The bus we have for this road trip is epic. SB Airbus is testing out some new buses I guess and the one we’re on has leather seats and tables and is way more comfortable than their other dust-infested buses. Tomorrow we’re playing Pacific, who we played a week ago and beat at home. Although it is hard to beat a team three times, we are focused and ready to go. It’s hard to play three consecutive days in a row but that adds to the excitement of the whole tourney. I mean, it’s better than practicing, that’s for sure. Practice yesterday was good. Short but sweet and all I did was watch mostly after having surgery to reset my nose, which I broke last week in practice. Playing at the Honda Center is pretty fun. It’s a huge arena and you can feel the cool breeze on the court from the ice underneath it for the hockey rink. I’m looking forward to playing in my last Big West tourney and I feel the rest of the team is excited as well. Everyone is healthy and ready to go and bring home a third Big West tourney title in as many years.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45459\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45459\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/","id":739,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[738,737,736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Begins Defense of of Big West Tournament Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/M-BBALL-v-UCR-2.11.2012-Kenneth-Song-72901.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/M-BBALL-v-UCR-2.11.2012-Kenneth-Song-72901.jpg?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will begin its defense as the two-time defending Big West Tournament Champions today when the team faces Pacific in the first round of the conference tournament at the...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team will begin its defense as the two-time defending Big West Tournament Champions today when the team faces Pacific in the first round of the conference tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</p>\n<p>“We feel good coming into the weekend, but we are very realistic,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “It’s a one-and-done situation and you have to play your best for three straight days.” Santa Barbara (18-9 overall, 12-4 Big West) enters the tournament this year on a roll as the No. 3 seed, having won six of the team’s last seven games.

On Jan. 28, the Gauchos escaped on the road to beat the Tigers 56-53. The 56 points were a season low, but Santa Barbara was able to get it done with solid defense, holding Pacific to 31.2 percent shooting. At home on March 1, UCSB dominated Pacific 76-61 behind a season-high 28 points and career-highs eight assists and six three-pointers from senior guard James Nunnally.</p>\n<p>“We have to control [Pacific’s] penetration,” coach Williams said. “If we come out and play hard and match up with them well, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Orlando Johnson and Nunnally both were honored as members of the All-Big West team earlier this week. Johnson, a top-25 finalist for the John R. Wooden Award, received First Team All-Big West honors for the third consecutive season, the first UCSB player ever to accomplish that feat. Nunnally was named to the Second Team All-Big West for the second time in three years. Johnson averaged a team-leading 20 points per game on the season, and led the team with 2.9 assists per game. Nunnally was second on the team with 15.9 points per game and first with 6.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great for them that they made All-League,” coach Williams said. “It is a great honor. Nun has played exceptionally well, as well as the best players in the league, and OJ continues to be OJ … I am very proud and very happy for both of them.”</p>\n<p>The Tigers are led by junior forward Travis Fulton and sophomore forward Ross Rivera, both of whom received All-Big West Honorable Mentions. Rivera was also named Sixth Man of the Year in the conference. Rivera leads the team with 11.4 points per game, while Fulton leads the team with 5.7 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>If they beat Pacific, UCSB will face the winner of No. 2 Cal State Fullerton (21-8, 12-4) and No. 7 UC Irvine (11-19, 6-10) in a game on Friday at 6:30 p.m. on ESPNU. The championship game is on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN2.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton and Irvine play the game right after our, so if we win we will watch them play,” coach Williams said. “We have watched tape on both schools, but we just ahve to take this one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>All tickets for Big West Tournament games are $10 for students.

We’re not going to beat teams by outscoring them. Our mindset is defense.”</p>\n<p>However, it couldn’t have been a worse start for UC Santa Barbara, which threw the ball away in each of its first five possessions. The Gauchos didn’t score their first basket until over six minutes had gone by on a basket by freshman forward Jackie Luna-Castro.</p>\n<p>“One hundred percent, it was a nightmare start,” Mitchell said. “I was like, ‘this is not the time for this to be happening.’”</p>\n<p>After going down by double figures, UCSB finally woke up. Baskets by the two seniors, Johnson and Kelsey Adrian, sparked a 14-4 run. The Gauchos went into halftime down just two at 26-24.</p>\n<p>“Because of my competitive nature, I just told them we’re going to win,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we knew we were going to the Honda Center.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after halftime, UCSB took its first lead. From there, it became the Zornig show. Zornig scored eight straight points for the Gauchos and consecutive baskets by sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit gave UCSB a 39-33 win with just over ten minutes to play.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] was in attack mode,” Mitchell said. We definitely needed another scoring option, but she did just as well a job on the defensive job as well.”</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Methlyn Onomoguho responded with a 7-0 run of her own to give the Anteaters the lead, but consecutive baskets by Underwood and a critical three by Adrian extended the lead to four. That would be enough for UCSB to hang on and upset Irvine.</p>\n<p>“The key was staying poised and composed,” Johnson said. “At this point in the season, it’s a mental game. We just have to stay focused and live in the moment.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kassandra McCalister, who killed the Gauchos in the last two match-ups, was held to just five.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Pacific at the Honda Center on Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45322\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45322\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/","id":738,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[737,736,735],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One on One With James Nunnally","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After another stellar season from guard James Nunnally, the UCSB men’s basketball team enters the Big West Tournament this Thursday as the No. 3 overall seed.

I didn’t want that Second Team honor, I feel like I am First Team … It will just make be hungry going forward though; I’m motivated like crazy right now. I just want to prove to everybody and all the coaches that voted against me that they made the wrong choice.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally was voted Second Team All-Big West in 2009-10 and an Honorable Mention All-Big West last season. He averaged 15.9 points per game and 6.2 rebounds per game this season, both career highs.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: After scoring 24 points on Senior Night last weekend, you moved into fourth place on the All-Time UCSB scoring list with 1,619 career points. Did you ever imagine this being possible when you came here as a freshman?</p>\n<p>JN: No, I never did. My first two games here I barely played — like 10 minutes a game. So I didn’t think that would be possible. Then I started to play more and more … at first it was looking rocky, but it’s been great since. … It’s pretty amazing looking back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: So after you went through your whole recruiting process, what led you to come to UCSB?</p>\n<p>JN: I didn’t really know too much about the university, then my coach back home that I was real close with — my brother’s junior college coach — he kind of was guiding me where to go. He told me, ‘It’s a good program; they are going to be bringing in a couple more freshmen to reboot the program.’ Then when I came on my visit and played with the guys, everyone was really cool, and the guys were accepting. They just sold me — it felt like the perfect fit.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally’s older brother, Michael, transferred to Pacific, where he and James played against each other multiple times.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: You and Orlando Johnson came in here together four years ago. You guys were freshman roommates, are great friends and now are two of the top four leading scorers in school history. How has it been to accomplish all that you have alongside a great teammate and friend like OJ?</p>\n<p>JN: It’s unbelievable. When we came in, we just said we wanted to win and do things players had never done at this school. It’s just been really, really fun, man. I’m honored to play with OJ … playing with OJ has been special — if they double him, I’ll be open, if they double me, he’ll be open, and I find him. We just feed off each other; it’s a good chemistry we have.</p>\n<p><em>Orlando Johnson ranks first on the all-time UCSB scoring list with 1,754 career points.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: This year your overall game has evolved, as you seem to be more patient on offense. Was this a conscious effort by you to improve in certain areas?</p>\n<p>JN: I have definitely made a leap this year. It’s just all the hard work I put in over summer. One of my best friends, we watched film together and worked out all summer. I just worked on everything I need to work on, you know? My post-game, seeing the floor, change of speed — just everything. And it really helped me.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally averaged a career high 2.6 assists per game this season.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: It was just announced that this season was the highest average attendance for the men’s basketball program in 17 years. What does it mean for the team on the court to have that kind of fan support at home?</p>\n<p>JN: Really?! Wow. That means a lot to us. We love to see the Gaucho Locos out there and all the fans from the community. It really helps us on the court; they are like the sixth man. I love playing against big crowds especially at home … it motivates us even more because we are doing it for the school and the community, and not just for ourselves.</p>\n<p><em>The Thunderdome drew an average crowd of 3,323 per game in 14 home games this season, the highest since 1995. Highlights were a sellout of 6,000 vs. Long Beach State on Jan. 21, and over 5,000 in back-to-back games vs. San Diego State and UNLV in November.RP: Off the court, what are your favorite things to do?</em></p>\n<p>JN: I just like to chill. I like to hang out, stay mellow … listen to music, hang out with my friends, watch sports all day. I like going to the beach if the weather is nice. I go and check out downtown SB a little bit. You know, just a little bit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Any pre-game rituals we should know about?</p>\n<p>JN: I just take a nap. I take like a 45-minute nap and then get in the shower, nothing too crazy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Kobe or LeBron?</p>\n<p>JN: Kobe. That’s my guy. Kobe is the one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What gets you fired up? Any trash talk?</p>\n<p>JN: I have a chip on my shoulder because people have overlooked me. I have the attitude like I’m the underdog. That’s the main thing that gets me going … when people start talking that gets me going too; that’s extra motivation. I don’t usually start the trash talk, but it will get me going.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: How many tattoos do you have?</p>\n<p>JN: I have about 17 tattoos.</p>\n<p>RP: Favorite one?</p>\n<p>JN: My favorite is the one on the left inside of my arm, of my mom’s name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What does the future hold for James Nunnally?</p>\n<p>JN: I’m definitely going to pursue my dream and try to get drafted or picked up in the NBA. That’s my number one priority. I feel like I’m an NBA player, and I feel like I can make it, and I feel like I am gonna make it … just gotta keep working hard and staying humble and hungry.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Do you have a favorite moment or memory from your four years here?</p>\n<p>JN: On the court, my favorite memory here was the chance to play against North Carolina in my freshman year. It was Hansborough’s first game back from injury, Ty Lawson, Danny Green, Wayne Ellington … that was a fun game in a fun atmosphere.</p>\n<p><em>North Carolina went on the win the National Championship that season. Nunnally had season-highs of 22 points and seven rebounds in the game. Hansborough, Lawson, Green and Ellington were all drafted to the NBA.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What about off the court?</p>\n<p>JN: Off the court, I gotta go with Floatopia 2009. That was probably one of the funnest days ever.</p>\n<p>RP: Yeah that was epic, and we were lucky — we caught that last one as freshmen.</p>\n<p>JN: We did! We caught the last one. One of the best days ever.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: You guys have won each of the last two Big West Tournament Championships, beating the No. 1 seed this year, Long Beach State, both times. Any predictions for the tournament this weekend?</p>\n<p>JN: No prediction — we are just going to play our hearts out. It’s win or go home now and as a senior, the stakes are much higher.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: When you look back on your time spent here in Santa Barbara, how will those memories be?</p>\n<p>JN: My time here has had its ups and downs, and all in all I have loved it. I love SB — what it’s taught me, everything I’ve learned, all the people I’ve met and all the relationships I’ve had … this place and these years will always have a place in my heart, man.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nunnally and the rest of the Gauchos will face off against Pacific at noon on Thursday in the first round of the Big West Tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45313\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45313\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/","id":740,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[739,738,737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Tourney Begins With UC Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s win or go home as March Madness kicks off for the UCSB women’s basketball team, which will face UC Irvine on the road tonight.

Although she averages 13.7 points per game (fifth in the Big West), McCalister scored 21 points in the first matchup and then single-handedly destroyed the Gauchos in Irvine when she scored a career-high 36 points.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great player and she made a lot of tough shots [on] senior night,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully we can do some different things to slow her down. It will be a team effort.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB can uphold its league-leading, tenacious defense that allows teams just 50.9 points per game, it will certainly have a shot at a win because Irvine’s strategy is simple: outscore its opponent. UCSB gave up a season-worst 72 points in the last matchup.</p>\n<p>“They’re extremely athletic, and we had a lot of mistakes in the last game,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully if we can cut down on the turnovers and do the little things, we can [go] out on the road and get a win.”</p>\n<p>In both games, the Anteaters found a weakness in the Gaucho defense, taking advantage behind the three-point arc. Against the Gauchos this season, the Anteaters shot an incredible 50.5 percent from downtown.</p>\n<p>“We have to come out like we did [Saturday] and feel like we have nothing to lose,” senior forward Kelsey Adrian said. “We have to put it all out there and just fight. We know what kind of team we are.”</p>\n<p>After that great win at UC Davis, there was only one key to continuing the momentum, according to senior guard Emilie Johnson: “Consistency … that’s all I have to say.”</p>\n<p>That might sound like a cliché, but inconsistency has been a big issue for the Gauchos. Before the win at Davis, UCSB had a poor performance against Pacific. Nevertheless, the team enters the Big West tournament having won six of their last eight games.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we feel confident after the game at Davis,” Mitchell said. “My goal was to have our team peaking at the right time, and I’m confident we’re playing to the best of our abilities.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Johnson leads the team, averaging 9.4 points per game. If UCSB wants to prolong their season, other players are going to have to step up. Adrian comes off a tremendous performance at Davis, where she tallied a career-high 21 points and drained four threes, and junior forward Kirsten Tilleman, who has played well in both games against Irvine, averages 13 points and eight boards. Both players will be huge in giving the Gauchos an inside presence.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/","id":735,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[734,733,732],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Send Off Seniors in Style","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Senior Night in the Thunderdome, the UCSB men’s basketball team marched out its five seniors at the opening tip as the heralded class led the Gauchos to a decisive 90-43 victory over UC Davis. �...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/E.Katzenson_MBball-V-UCD.jpg?resize=167%2C313\" alt=\"\" width=\"167\" height=\"313\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">On Senior Night in the Thunderdome, the UCSB men’s basketball team marched out its five seniors at the opening tip as the heralded class led the Gauchos to a decisive 90-43 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“That was probably the most fun game I have been a part of,” senior guard Christian “Goose” Peterson said. “We jumped out on them early and after that we were just playing relaxed and having fun.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, UCSB (18-9 overall, 12-4 Big West) will enter the Big West Tournament as the third seed, behind first-place Long Beach State (22-8, 15-1) and second-place Cal State Fullerton (21-8, 12-4).

Senior center Greg Somogyi filled up the stat sheet with six points, four rebounds, two assists, one steal and four blocks. Somogyi is currently second on the UCSB all-time blocks list with 181. Peterson added five points, four rebounds, two assists and two steals. Goose also hit his first three-pointer of his career in the second half.</p>\n<p>“I was telling the guys all week that I was gonna put up a three,” Peterson said. “Coach told us he was going to take out all the seniors in a couple minutes, so I said ‘give me the ball, I’m putting one up.’ I got the ball from Jaimé and just let it fly … it felt good right away.”</p>\n<p>Off the bench, freshman center Alan Williams added 17 points and nine rebounds and sophomore guard Kyle Boswell poured in 14 points including three three-pointers.</p>\n<p>On the first shot of the game, Johnson hit a three-pointer that set the tone for the rest of the night. Up 21-13, UCSB ran off a 22-0 run to stretch its lead to 30 with just under six minutes to play in the first half. Santa Barbara entered the locker room up 47-21.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out in the second half and continued the onslaught. The Gauchos ended the game on a 16-2 run to win with its largest lead at 90-43. The 47-point margin of victory was the largest for UCSB since a 1971 win over Chicago State 108-56.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for UCSB’s first-round matchup with Pacific is set for noon on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45254\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/gauchos-send-seniors-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45254\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/gauchos-send-seniors-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/gauchos-send-seniors-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/gauchos-send-seniors-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/gauchos-send-seniors-style/","id":736,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[735,734,733],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Secures No. 6 Spot With Win vs. Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Behind the effort of senior guard Kelsey Adrian, the UCSB women’s basketball team outlasted UC Davis 60-56 on the road in its final game of the regular season, breaking a six-game win streak by UC D...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DWade-Bball-V-CSUB-14.jpg?resize=187%2C283\" alt=\"\" width=\"187\" height=\"283\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Behind the effort of senior guard Kelsey Adrian, the UCSB women’s basketball team outlasted UC Davis 60-56 on the road in its final game of the regular season, breaking a six-game win streak by UC Davis over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It was just a great senior effort by [Kelsey],” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We put her on the baseline knowing that’s where a lot of the open shots would come from, and she made them when it counted.”</p>\n<p>Adrian scored a career-high 21 points on 7-of-13 shooting to improve the Gauchos to 8-8 in the Big West and 14-15 overall, marking the 22nd consecutive season UC Santa Barbara has finished .500 or better in conference.

Adrian knocked down three treys in the run, the first coming from 25 feet out as the shot clock expired.</p>\n<p>“I think that shot really got me going and gave me confidence,” Adrian said. “There was one second left, and I knew I was just going to have to chuck it up. It felt really good going in.”</p>\n<p>UCSB took a 10-point lead into halftime, holding Davis to 22 points. Davis was held scoreless for over five minutes to start the game, and while the Aggies made critical threes down the stretch, they were kept in check in the first half, shooting 22.2 percent.</p>\n<p>“Going in, we knew that they were three-point shooters and that they like to drive and get all the way to the rim for lay-ups,” Mitchell said. “If you make someone pull up and take a jumper, then we were getting what we wanted out of this game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB tried to put the game away in the second half, but the Aggies continued to hang around, and an offensive dry spell down the stretch allowed Davis back into the mix.</p>\n<p>“Davis is a great team and we expected them to make a run,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “This [was] their senior night and their final home game, so we just wanted to stay composed. We had to play to win.”</p>\n<p>The defense was solid for the Gauchos, who made critical stops down the stretch to ensure it didn’t become a one-possession game.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB shot a sizzling 47.6 percent from the field, including 46.7 percent from downtown. The Gauchos had three players in double figures as well. Besides Adrian, Johnson contributed 13 points and five assists while Tilleman tallied 11 points and nine boards.</p>\n<p>“We made shots and our shot selection was great,” Mitchell said. “Emilie ran the show for 40 minutes and Tilleman got the big boards.”</p>\n<p>With the win, UCSB secured the sixth seed in the Big West and will head south to play third seed UC Irvine Tuesday in the opening round of the Big West Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45253\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45253\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/","id":734,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[733,732,731],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Blown Out At Pacific, Faces Davis on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In losing to Pacific 60-40 in a devastating blowout, The UCSB women’s basketball team also lost the chance to host a home playoff game in the Big West tournament.

UCSB has lost six straight games to the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“We have to play with confidence,” Mason said. “We have nothing to lose, so we have to play like that.”</p>\n<p>Most known for their trapping defense, the Aggies feature the second best scoring defense in conference, just behind the Gauchos. They’re also second in the Big West in steals, averaging 10.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“Davis is always a tricky game with the system they play,” sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I think for us early on, we need to be sharp and focused. We can’t be loose with the ball because Davis really takes advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to be patient and calm to find success on offense, which was an issue against Pacific yesterday. UCSB reverted back to their shooting woes from earlier in the season, only scoring 15 points in the second half, shooting 7-28 from the field.</p>\n<p>“There wasn’t the ‘let’s get it done’ mentality,” junior guard Destini Mason said. “Davis is definitely different from other teams, so we really going to have to focus offensively.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies, who lead the league in three point field goals made per game with seven, killed the Gauchos from behind the arc in the last matchup, shooting 54.5 percent in the first period. Hannah Stephens led all scorers with 16, including 4-5 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“[Stephens] hit four threes in the first half and we did a better job in the second half,” Mitchell said. “Once someone knocks down one or two threes, you should know they’re a shooter and get your hands up.”</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s loss, both Pacific and UCSB came out strong. Early in the first half, there were seven ties and eight lead changes. However, with the score tied at 21 apiece, the Tigers mounted a 15-4 run to end the first half and took an 11 point lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>After halftime, it seemed nothing would go right for the Gauchos. After the Gauchos closed the gap to single digits, Pacific went on an 18-0 run.

With UCSB’s final game of the season this Saturday and the Big West postseason tournament next week, both center Alan “Big Al” Williams and point guard T.J. Taylor will have a major say in whether UCSB can make it back to the Big Dance for a third consecutive season.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun being the two young guys getting the minutes on the team,” Williams said. “In preseason and stuff we were saying that we wanted to start, and we knew that if we kept working hard it could happen.”</p>\n<p>Entering the school year last summer, both Williams and Taylor expected they would be watching most games wearing street clothes as redshirt freshmen.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Coming in, we both thought we would have to redshirt,” Taylor said. “Then a couple of guys got hurt or whatever, and we both got the opportunity to play more.”</p>\n<p>Both freshmen have taken advantage of the opportunity, running with it all the way to starting jobs. Williams has started 14 of 24 games overall for the Gauchos, including 13 of 14 in conference play. Taylor has started nine games overall for UCSB, including eight in conference.</p>\n<p>“Al and T.J. have really both created their own opportunities by playing well when given the chance,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Especially Al; every time he played he was productive and his minutes just got extended as he carved out a niche for himself.”</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that anyone who has seen a UCSB game this season knows Williams’ niche is rebounding the basketball. The 6’7” big man is currently averaging 8.2 rebounds per game in conference play, good for third in the Big West. His 1.9 blocks per game also rank third in the Big West. Impressively, Williams has more offensive rebounds on the season, a statistic in which he ranks first place in the league, than defensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I know my biggest impact is rebounding the ball,” Williams said. “It takes pressure off my guards knowing they can put up shots and I’m under the basket rebounding … I just try to go after it and get it done — it’s fun to work hard.” <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/T.J.-Taylor-vs-UNLV_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=307%2C220\" alt=\"\" width=\"307\" height=\"220\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>“It is invaluable to know your role as a player,” coach Williams said. “The key to being successful, whether you are a player on a team or in a corporation, is that you see what you can bring to the table. … Al sees what he brings, he does what he is best at and he is excited about doing it every day.”</p>\n<p>Big Al has become a fan favorite this season, as the Gaucho Locos’ cheers often reach their loudest after Williams blocks a shot, grabs an offensive rebound or dives for a loose ball.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of fun to go out there and try to bring as much energy as possible,” Williams said. “Our fans are loud and supportive … we do it for them, we represent this whole campus and school, it feels good that they are supporting us.”</p>\n<p>Standing at 5’9”, Taylor is the lightning to Williams’ thunder. Often the smallest guy on the court, Taylor makes up for his lack of size with exceptional speed and fearlessness.</p>\n<p>“He has got great quickness and is a natural leader,” coach Williams said. “He has this natural charisma about him that is just contagious.”</p>\n<p>As a young point guard often asked to run a veteran-laden team, the responsibility of being a leader is magnified. Taylor, who ranks fifth on the team in minutes and third in assist-to-turnover ratio in conference, is accepting and embracing the challenge with an eye toward the future.</p>\n<p>“If I can become a good leader for this team with a veteran group, it will help me in the future,” Taylor said. “I would like to work on becoming more vocal, more fearless and just fully taking advantage of the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The recruiting experiences for Williams and Taylor were not alike, as different circumstances in the past few years eventually brought the pair to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Williams played high school basketball in Phoenix, Arizona, and was not highly recruited out of high school despite winning two state championships in his sophomore and junior seasons.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really start getting recruited until the summer between my junior year and senior year,” Williams said. “That was the last recruiting period so I guess you could say I was a late bloomer.”</p>\n<p>Initially unsure of whether Williams was a good fit for UCSB, coach Williams decided to make an offer after attending a tournament to watch him play.</p>\n<p>“Watching him in a tournament in Arizona, I remember a specific play where he was running the length of the floor at full speed,” coach Williams recalled. “He picks up a ball thrown at his ankles in a dead sprint and finished with a finger roll right over the rim … a guy with that kind of ability for a big man is just rare.”</p>\n<p>Taylor’s path to UCSB began differently. Out of Oakland, Taylor had originally committed to Santa Clara as a sophomore before later deciding to reopen his recruiting. That is when coach Williams swooped in.</p>\n<p>“I liked T.J., but I fell in love with the kid when it came down to the in-home visit,” coach Williams said. “When I went in the home and got to know his family and his mother and grandmother, I fell in love with the kid. I walked out of the home and said I would really love to have him — he would be a great fit for our program.”</p>\n<p>As this year’s squad looks to close out its season with a Big West championship and trip to the NCAA Tournament, Williams and Taylor understand that their impact at UCSB will be felt for years to come.</p>\n<p>“It only gets better,” Taylor said. “We don’t plan on having any dip in the program in the future. We will be coming strong here for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>“We will be the sophomore veterans next year,” Williams added.</p>\n<p>A bit of an oxymoron, but that is quite possibly the truth. As the only two regular starters returning to a team that will lose five seniors to graduation, much of the leadership roles will fall on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>“That’s why it’s good for us to be out there getting the experience,” Taylor said. “To set the tone for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>While excited and optimistic about the program’s future, coach Williams remains reserved with his expectations.</p>\n<p>“They have some big shoes to fill,” coach Williams said. “They still have a lot to prove. … However, I love the fact that they are excited about it and I do think this freshman class has a chance to be as great as our graduating senior class right now.”</p>\n<p>The immediate future will allow both Williams and Taylor to make a difference in the Gauchos’ postseason run this season, but the freshman duo will have three more years to make a lasting impact on the UCSB men’s basketball program.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/","id":733,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[732,731,730],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two-Game Road Trip Begins at Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s basketball finishes their regular season with a crucial road trip north to Pacific Thursday and UC Davis Saturday, which will ultimately determine if the Gauchos receive a home playoff ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s basketball finishes their regular season with a crucial road trip north to Pacific <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Untitled-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Thursday and UC Davis Saturday, which will ultimately determine if the Gauchos receive a home playoff game in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB currently sits in sixth place in the Big West standings with an overall record of 13-14 and 7-7 in conference.

Also, in the last six games, junior center Kristen Tilleman has provided a presence inside, averaging 10.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing a lot smoother on the offensive end of things,” Mitchell said. “We did a decent job against them defensively [last time], but at that time, we were really struggling offensively. If we can find a flow early, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos will continue to rely on their league leading defense. On average, UCSB holds its opponents to 35.6 percent shooting and 51.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ defense will square off against Pacific’s potent offense, which ranks second in the Big West in scoring at about 70 points per game. The Tigers also rank second in three point shooting field goals per game, averaging 5.7. UCSB will need to get its hands up, since this is an area that opponents have successfully taken advantage of all year.</p>\n<p>Pacific’s offense is also very balanced. They feature two of the top nine scorers in the Big West in junior forward Kendall Rodriguez and junior guard Erica McKenzie.</p>\n<p>“We play everyone straight up man,” Mitchell said. “We’ll probably look at different people guarding players that hurt us last game, but that’ll be the only adjustment we make.”</p>\n<p>The two teams contain three of the top rebounders in conference — Rodriguez for Pacific and Tilleman and Underwood for the Gauchos. Last time, the Tigers won the rebounding battle 39-31, despite Tilleman’s 12 boards.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets and Tilleman] typically take care of their job on the rebounding side, but we’ll need players like Destini Mason and Kelsey Adrian and other guards getting the long rebounds because they shoot a lot of threes,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Alex G. Spanos Center.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45156\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45156\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/","id":732,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[731,730,729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Welcomes University of Pacific to the Thunderdome for Big West Matchup","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will play the second of a three-game homestand tonight against the University of the Pacific.

He hit his first two shots of the game, the second a three-pointer that gave him the record. The Seaside, Calif., native now has 1,710 career points in only three seasons for UCSB, after transferring from Loyola Marymount following his freshman year.</p>\n<p>“Orlando has been a special player,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He has had an unbelievable career, and to set this record in only three years is a great accomplishment … he has improved so much because he works on his game so hard — he is relentless.”</p>\n<p>Nunnally, who currently has 1,570 career points for the Gauchos putting him at No. 6 all-time, shared his coach’s sentiments about his teammate and friend.</p>\n<p>“I’m proud of that guy, man,” Nunnally said of his former freshman roommate. “Ever since he got here he has worked hard, always in the gym … I’m really proud of him; that’s one of my best friends.”</p>\n<p>Up 21-16 in the first half, the Gauchos got hot offensively. Behind seven points from Nunnally, UCSB ran off an 11-0 run to extend its lead to 32-16. Both Johnson and Nunnally reached double figures by halftime, but 10 offensive rebounds by Cal Poly kept them within striking distance at 31-40.</p>\n<p>“I liked how we played tonight,” Williams said. “I liked our energy level … we are a team that is getting better … I was happy with our effort in the second half, especially on the boards after that first half.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly fought to cut the deficit to seven on multiple occasions early in the second half, but could get no closer. With the score at 49-42, Johnson took over. The senior captain assisted on three-pointer from junior guard Nate Garth, then scored five straight points capped off by a steal and slam dunk on the ensuing fast break. Johnson hung on the rim and slapped the backboards; he was consequently whistled for a technical foul on the play.</p>\n<p>“I just got a little too emotional,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had trouble closing out the Mustangs, but held off its rivals just long enough. The final eight-point lead was the Gauchos’ smallest since the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two games of the season this week at home, against Pacific on Thursday and UC Davis on Saturday. After that is the Big West Tournament, beginning next Thursday.</p>\n<p>“We are just trying to get better every game,” Nunnally said. “We have been improving every game and are on the right track heading into the conference tournament.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/","id":764,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[763,762,761],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast Long Beach State 47-35","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It wasn’t pretty, but the UCSB women’s basketball team was happy to take the 47-35 victory against Long Beach State Saturday afternoon in its final regular season home game, guaranteeing a win for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AnnieHall_vCSUN-1.jpg?resize=255%2C237\" alt=\"\" width=\"255\" height=\"237\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">It wasn’t pretty, but the UCSB women’s basketball team was happy to take the 47-35 victory against Long Beach State Saturday afternoon in its final regular season home game, guaranteeing a win for what may be the last game in the Thunderdome for its two seniors, Emilie Johnson and Kelsey Adrian.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited that we found a way to win for our seniors because this will be a memory they have for the rest of their lives,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “It’s a win and we take it. An ugly win is a lot better than a pretty loss at this point in the year.”</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara has now won five out of its last six games and took sixth place in the Big West standings from Long Beach.

The Gauchos committed a season-high 27 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our [turnovers] were unforced, and it was distributed throughout the team,” Mitchell said. “So that tells you there was never a flow in this game or our players [weren’t] comfortable and I’m not sure why.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, UCSB dominated the boards, outrebounding Long Beach 46-17, and outscored the 49ers 11-0 in second chance points.

Johnson and Adrian both got on the board quickly and sparked a 9-0 run. Another 8-0 run, combined with the Gauchos’ outstanding defense, gave them a 23-11 halftime lead. The 11 points were the fourth-least ever allowed in a first half by UCSB.</p>\n<p>“That’s my mindset and the kids have bought into that,” Mitchell said. “At this time in the year, that’s what I expect, so that’s no surprise to me.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos sustained their lead in the second half, not allowing the 49ers to get any closer than nine points.</p>\n<p>“We’re learning to play together as a team and we’re clicking better,” Adrian said. “We have a better sense of where [each] person wants the ball.”</p>\n<p>Johnson led the Gauchos with 13 points, shooting 6-11. Adrian finished with six points and was 2-5 from downtown. Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 10 points and five assists, scoring in double figures for the first time in five games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play their final games of the season on the road as they make a road trip north to face Pacific and UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45024\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-outlast-long-beach-state-4735/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45024\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-outlast-long-beach-state-4735/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-outlast-long-beach-state-4735/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-outlast-long-beach-state-4735/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-outlast-long-beach-state-4735/","id":763,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[762,761,760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Beneath the Mask – Kelsey Adrian","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sports Editor Brent Pella sits down with women’s senior guard Kelsey Adrian.
