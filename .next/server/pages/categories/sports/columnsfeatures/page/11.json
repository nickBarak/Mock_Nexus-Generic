This was before Sam — a defensive lineman and a leader on the team — knew his name would be listed on NFL draft boards at the season’s end after a breakout year.</p>\n<p>“I came up to my team and told them ‘Hey, I’m Michael Sam, I’m from Hitchcock, Texas, my major is Sport Management, and I’m gay.’ That was the first time I ever said I was gay,” he revealed.</p>\n<p>With that announcement, Sam set himself up for being the first openly gay player drafted into the NFL. Monday at Corwin Pavilion, he discussed his upbringing and coming out process in an event hosted by UCSB Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up as the seventh of eight children in the Southeast Texas town of Hitchcock was not easy for Sam. His family name was synonymous with trouble in the area. Two of his siblings died before he turned six, and one was shot down trying to rob a house. Two more brothers spent time in prison and one went missing in 1998.</p>\n<p>“They abused me daily and got to the point that I wasn’t safe at home,” Sam said of his brothers’ treatment towards him. “So I would always leave my house at odd hours. I would take long walks. It was very difficult for me.”</p>\n<p>His relationship with his parents mimicked a similar disconnect. Sam’s mother did not want him playing sports, leading to discord between the two. His father was in and out of his life. He discussed he originally wanted to come out to his parents at his graduation, but for some reason, backed out.</p>\n<p>When he did finally tell them, Sam had the impression his mother already knew, while his father did not say much. “He just went to the bar and got drunk,” Sam added.</p>\n<p>As he dealt with sexuality in his teen years, Sam found love in college. The image most associated with Sam is with his fiancé, Vito Cammisano, right after the St. Louis Rams drafted him in the final round of the NFL Draft. Cameras captured the couple embracing in a heartwarming hug and kiss. In January, Sam proposed to Vito on the couple’s trip to Rome on the same day as Sam’s birthday.</p>\n<p>Sam and Cammisano’s relationship wasn’t always a love story from the start. In fact, there was dislike for one another when they first met. Sam approached Cammisano at a party his freshman year, asking Cammisano if he was okay after noticing him hunched over almost as if he was about to vomit.</p>\n<p>“I said ‘Hey, are you OK?’ and Vito slowly looked up at me and said ‘Get away from me,’” Sam said. “I lost it. I don’t care who you are, you don’t disrespect me to my face. So I actually didn’t talk to Vito for two years.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until Sam decided to approach Cammisano at a bar that romance between the two ensued.</p>\n<p>“I bought him a drink and put my hand on his back and the rest is history,” Sam told the audience.</p>\n<p>Their relationship, however, took a turn for the worst. Fear of living in a small college town with the pressure of being a star player on the football team made it impossible for Sam to come out publicly; he wasn’t ready.</p>\n<p>Cammisano was already out and grew tired of not being able to be seen in public with Sam. The two broke up because of it.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t go out together, we had to have our friends there and I had to be separated,” Sam said. “Eventually, we started fighting and it got really hard for us. Vito said he couldn’t do this anymore; this isn’t healthy for us.”</p>\n<p>Months passed, but the two got back together and have been with each other ever since. It was Vito who gave Sam the courage to come out. Many felt Sam gambled by coming out right before the draft because of possible discrimination he might face from NFL teams. Nonetheless, the Rams selected him with the 249th pick in the draft.</p>\n<p>While with St. Louis, he acknowledged he never felt excluded because of his sexuality. Instead, teammates treated him like any other rookie, making him carry team equipment and earn his spot on the team.</p>\n<p>It was in his second preseason game where he said he felt part of the team. It was also the same game in which he sacked Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel.</p>\n<p>Although he had a legitimate shot at a roster spot, his time in St. Louis was limited to only the preseason as he was released in the final round of cuts before the start of the season.</p>\n<p>He then bounced to the Dallas Cowboys’ practice squad, where he said teammates Tony Romo, Jason Witten and DeMarco Murray supported him throughout before he was waived.</p>\n<p>Sam is currently a free agent, waiting to get a call from an NFL team. When asked what he thought his chances of playing in the league are, he said he did not know, and is open to playing professionally in the Canadian Football League.</p>\n<p>Before his talk ended, Sam offered some final words of encouragement.</p>\n<p>“If you think you might be alone, someone might disown you, you might not have friends or people are trying to bully you, I say don’t be afraid.” Sam remarked. “… Together we will change the world for the better, for each one of us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of May 7, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/","id":2022,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2021,2020,2019],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ovechkin, Holtby Dazzle as Washington Gives the Rangers All That They Can Handle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/game-4-capitals-3-rangers-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/game-4-capitals-3-rangers-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Jack Mathews continues breaking down this NHL Playoffs.

As the Divisional round of the NHL playoffs began this week, the battle for the Stanley Cup grew more and more fierce as rivals were pitted against each other in all four series. Out west, the Ducks and the Blackhawks continue to flex their muscles as both teams hold a 2-0 series lead over their opponents. The Eastern conference has been much less one-sided as Tampa Bay currently holds a 2-0 series lead, but required double overtime to beat the Canadiens in game 1. The Capitals and the Rangers have provided the most entertaining series thus far and the heroics of Braden Holtby have led Washington to a 2-1 series lead.<br>\n<strong>Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers (2-1 Capitals)</strong>– Wow. This series has the feel of a Stanley Cup finals and it is only three games in. Alex Ovechkin has been lights out just like he has been all season and may have had the goal of the year in their 3-2 loss to the Rangers in game two. Hats off to Braden Holtby who has outplayed his counterpart Henrik Lundqvist so far, including a masterful 30 save shutout in the Capitals 1-0 victory on Monday. New York’s offense has been their only question mark this postseason and those questions are becoming more and more prevalent as they have only mustered four goals in three games so far and seem to be relying a bit too heavily on their top-notch goaltending.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2pjERKAc_8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span><br>\n<strong>Anaheim Ducks vs. Calgary Flames (2-0 Ducks)</strong>– Calgary has been this years Cinderella story in the NHL playoffs, but it looks like their run may come to abrupt end if the Ducks keep playing the way that they are. Anaheim cruised to a 6-1 victory over the Flames in game one and Calgary goaltender Jonas Hiller did not even make it out of the first period against his former team. Frederik Andersen has solidified himself as the Ducks top goaltender and is playing like he wants the Stanley Cup, giving up only one goal over the first two games of the series. Anaheim is the only undefeated team in the postseason and the farther they advance, the more advantageous all of their rest will be. Calgary needs to work some of their magic at home to have any chance of advancing as Jiri Hudler, Johnny Gaudreau, and Sean Monahan have all been held without a point through two games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota Wild (2-0 Blackhawks)</strong>– Devan Dubnyk has been another feel-good story this season as his play in net has propelled Minnesota to an improbable run to the second round of the playoffs. Chicago has scored 8 goals in their first two games, including two beauties from Patrick Kane in the Blackhawks 4-1 victory in game two. Corey Crawford has been back in net and has not been perfect, but has made 30 saves in both victories and has done enough to win with an electric offense in front of him. Minnesota is not out of it yet though as Devan Dubnyk and an electric offense led by Zach Parise will be in desperation mode over the next few days to even this series. That will not be possible if the Wild defenseman are unable to find an answer for the high-octane attack for the Blackhawks. All four lines have potential to put the puck in the net, but All-Star Wild defenseman Ryan Suter and company should be able to neutralize them better at home over the next two games. I believe the depth of Chicago will ultimately be too much for the Wild to win this series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NwYoaT8IX4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span><br>\n<strong>Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Montreal Canadiens (2-0 Lightning)</strong>– This series is a classic case of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object with the offense of Tampa Bay being pitted against likely MVP Carey Price for Montreal. So far it has been all Lightning all the time, as Tampa Bay needed seven games to beat Detroit; however, they have dominated Atlantic division rival Montreal so far. Tyler Johnson has been masterful all postseason and scored his seventh goal of the playoffs in a 2-1 double overtime thriller in game one. Game two was not early as close as the Lightning charged their way to a 6-2 victory at the Bell Centre. Rest has not deterred the Lightning so far and with games three and four in Tampa Bay, this series could ultimately be the most unlikely sweep of them all. Carey Price will bring his best to the table but it is up to the players around him to provide support if the Canadiens have any hopes of moving on.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Looking to extend his undefeated streak and self-proclaimed title of being boxing’s best, the tale of the tape has Mayweather and Pacquiao matched up pretty evenly.</p>\n<p>As the prime of both boxers’ careers comes to nearing an end, Saturday’s match remains as a fight between the top two fighters in boxing. Mayweather, at age 38, is just two years older than Pacquiao (36). Other assets such as height and reach possess more significance when comparing the two.</p>\n<p>Mayweather has the upper hand in both categories at 5’8” and a five-inch advantage in reach at 72.” Although Pacquiao stands at 5’6 ½” with a reach of 67,” his left-hand fighting stance, better known Southpaw, is the primary concern for “TMT’s” head honcho.</p>\n<p>Known for being a defensive guru that has mastered the art of counter-punching, Mayweather has constantly outsmarted opponents with his patient approach. He tends to bait opponents while ducking and dodging until he finally finds that “sore spot” to pick at. Apparently this technique has been of value with the result of no losses, but Mayweather just might have to step outside of his comfort zone in his duel with the “Pacman.”</p>\n<p>It has been nearly three years since Mayweather’s last knockout. His controversial knockout of Victor Ortiz is the lasting glimpse we have of Mayweather putting someone on the canvas. Although Mayweather is known for his defensive trademark, earning his 48th victory may come down to a knockout.</p>\n<p>His advantage in reach possibly will provide him with the sufficient amount of spacing to put Pacquiao to sleep. But the pursuit of a knockout comes at a price as Pacquiao will undoubtedly stun Mayweather with some punches if he decides to become more offensively dependent.</p>\n<p>Pacquiao is known for his attacking style in the boxing ring and seems ready to go toe-to-toe with Mayweather. His aggressiveness to throw punches and land them will be key in the fight.</p>\n<p>Pacquiao contains a more lethal power punch than Mayweather, but it’s the amount of punches per round that he can land that is key. His ability to consistently outpunch Mayweather could be of benefit on the judges’ scorecards. Still, Pacquiao must remain accurate and not allow his aggressiveness to become reckless punches that could be beneficial to Mayweather.</p>\n<p>While the heroic story of Pacquiao, the “good guy,” beating Mayweather the “bad guy” would be a heartwarming ending to the ongoing beef between the two, let’s be realistic. Since his last loss in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Mayweather has catapulted boxing to a new platform with his dominance and will expand his legacy with a win Saturday evening.</p>\n<p>Mayweather versus Pacquiao has the potential to be the best fight this generation will see. All the “what if’s” and hopes of the two will finally be put to rest on Saturday when the two best pound-for-pound fighters meet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of April 30, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Another year, another first round of the playoffs and yet another sorry Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Every year, we see the same story: The “Wild West” boasts a large number of 50-win teams, while the East has about one or two teams that have just a slim chance of challenging whatever squad LeBron James is on. The rest of the East is just there to fill the void.</p>\n<p>In fact, excluding the lockout shortened 2011-12 season, the last time the East didn’t have at least one playoff team at or below .500 was all the way back in 2005!</p>\n<p>The last time the West had a team below .500 in a full season? All the way back in 1997. Back when Kobe Bryant hadn’t even grown his first afro. Back when Michael Jordan was still winning championships with the Bulls. That long ago.</p>\n<p>Nobody wants to see teams with losing records getting swept out of the first round like some sad formality. I know I don’t. I’m sure Charles Barkley doesn’t either. And his opinion matters.</p>\n<p>Why should OKC not get a chance to play in May with a record of 45-37 when you have the Brooklyn Nets six games under .500 at 38-44 getting a chance to upset the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks?</p>\n<p>And this brings me to my next point. Since teams in the East play three or four games against each other while they only play the West two times a year, how will we ever know how good the East really is?</p>\n<p>Sure, the Hawks can take the No. 1 seed going an impressive 60-22, but does that even mean anything? To me, it means that their strength of schedule was a whole lot easier than OKC’s. Who knows what Russell Westbrook and the Thunder could have accomplished if they were located just a couple states to the right.</p>\n<p>To prove my point, the aforementioned Brooklyn Nets, who entered their first round series with Atlanta with a sizable 22-win margin between the two teams, managed to send the series back to Atlanta for Game 5 tied 2-2.</p>\n<p>The Hawks have since taken a 3-2 lead, but let’s get one thing straight: home-court advantage or not, I don’t think Atlanta is scaring anyone in the conference finals. And we all know who is most likely going to be waiting for them there, unless the Bulls can finally get past “The King”.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Chicago has only helped prove my point even more, dropping two straight games to the extremely talented (not really) Milwaukee Bucks, who claimed the six seed with a 41-41 record.</p>\n<p>Where would these teams be if they had to play three or four games against Western Conference teams throughout the season? My guess is closer to the Lakers’ record these past two years. Sorry Laker fans, it hurts me, too.</p>\n<p>So the question of when, if ever, the NBA will reformat the playoff seeding structure to create a fairer set of matchups continues to be asked. Luckily for those poor fans of middling-Western-Conference-past who have had to look at the standings and say “Darn, we didn’t make it this year, but if we were in the East we would’ve had home-court advantage!” NBA commissioner Adam Silver has already claimed that he will be “looking into restructuring” the playoff structure.</p>\n<p>Why hasn’t this been looked into in the past? I blame David Stern, but then again I blame him for everything. I blame him for ruining the end of Kobe’s career, I blame him for making the Clippers the team to cheer for in L.A., I blame him for when I stubbed my toe getting out of the shower this morning. I wouldn’t be surprised if he and Donald Sterling were related, and I’m not sure if that even makes sense. I just don’t like the man.</p>\n<p>But on a more serious note, the end of this poorly-structured playoff setup may be nearing its end, or at least on its way to some improvements. Unless, of course, Silver is just biding his time until the conferences balance out a bit and he doesn’t have to change anything.</p>\n<p>Either way, I’m just happy I’m not a fan of a No. 9, 10, or 11 seed in the West that has to watch from home as a team like the Nets goes toe-to-toe with the East’s finest in Atlanta. I’m proud to cheer on my Lakers and their 14th-best standing in the West. Go big or go home, baby.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>First Round Just as Exciting as Ever</strong></p>\n<p><em>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</em></p>\n<p>Last year’s NBA Playoffs were definitely one to remember, especially in that first round that drew five game sevens. The action was exciting, there were quality teams and both Kevin Durant and Paul George were active and lively. There was nothing not to love about last year’s playoffs, but as we have moved to this year’s postseason, there is definitely a dissonance that has been ignited by the past action.</p>\n<p>NBA fans have become completely spoiled by the insanity that was first round last year and we have become unappreciative of the great basketball that is being played just before our eyes simply because more than half of the series aren’t headed to a sudden death game and the series are little more one-sided.</p>\n<p>What us fans need right now is to think back to before last year’s playoffs, when we were actually gracious for such a postseason. This year, everything is different and we should treat it as such, which means realizing how to enjoy this excitement from this year’s perspective.</p>\n<p>I mean just look at the No. 1 seeds this year, which held the sixth and eighth seeds in 2014 and took first round exits. We don’t even have any of the same players in the MVP race and three of the teams that made the conference finals last year (Miami, Indiana, Oklahoma City) didn’t even make it to the postseason.</p>\n<p>If you are like me and hail from SoCal, I hope that you were able to enjoy the Warriors vs. Pelicans series since it was actually a fun series. Yes, I know you’re tired of the Warriors and you’re afraid of the subsequent trash-talk from your NorCal housemates, but please don’t think that they walked through that series.</p>\n<p>The average margin of victory for Golden State in that series was just eight points over New Orleans. If the No. 1 seed in the conference with the NBA’s best record only beats the eighth seed by eight points a game, then the Western Conference must be as powerful as they say it is. Don’t let a series let you think otherwise simply because one team got swept.</p>\n<p>We got to see what kinds of things the mighty Warriors struggle with, such as guarding someone like Anthony Davis, who held the best stat line out of any player in the first round so far. He averaged 31.5 points, 11 boards, three blocks and a little over one steal while shooting 54 percent from the field in his first playoffs series ever. The kid really showed that he belongs not only in the league, but also in the places of the league where the lights shine the brightest.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Warriors there isn’t anyone else like A.D. in the NBA, but we’ll see how they can handle the duo of Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol.</p>\n<p>So on the West side of the bracket we had a sweep, but what about the East side? We had two of them and they were both even more interesting than the Warriors’ win.</p>\n<p>Washington took everybody by surprise after being the only team to snatch up any wins on the road and played even better when they got home, where they have struggled. The Wizards didn’t have much of a second half to their season, which led people to pick the Raptors to win or at least make the series go longer than four games. Washington showed up though and now has a record of 8-1 as the five seed in the last two years in the first round.</p>\n<p>The Cavs had the other sweep, and the hasty drama that followed made it all the more fun to watch. Although they won all four games, it got very chippy and the injury to K-Love could make that Celtics series hold a little more weight to the Cavs’ performance going forward.</p>\n<p>Away from these sweeps, we truly have many series that are playing out just how we love them to. There are still two series out East that have yet to be decided, and along with that, the Clippers and Spurs are making the Playoffs amazing on their own!</p>\n<p>Look, I know it’s not the same as last year’s playoffs but that doesn’t means it’s any less exciting, it’s just different.

The transition from high school to college is a life-changing experience that varies for each individual. Nonetheless, the change is like a culture shock when coming from a different state.</p>\n<p>For junior attacker Bryn Hudson of the UCSB women’s water polo team, making the move from Oregon to California went beyond the ordinary lifestyle she was familiar with. She was born on Feb. 5, 1994 in Tualatin,Oregon, a small city with the population of just under 27,000 people. A true born and raised Oregon native, she went on and attended Tualatin High School from 2008-2012. Hudson helped win two consecutive Oregon State championships and earned various other prestigious accolades.</p>\n<p>Just like any younger sibling does, she looked up to her older brother Lucas and gives him credit for her interest in water polo.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I saw him playing water polo and it looked so much fun, and I ended up being pretty good at it,” Hudson said. “Around when I was 14 years old, I had a coach that really invested a lot in me and kind of took to me and made sure I was on the right path to the collegiate level.”</p>\n<p>Her decision to leave Tualatin for UCSB seems like an obvious decision anyone would make, but is more surreal when analyzed. The out-of-state expenses, not knowing the city and its people and being one of two players on UCSB’s roster from a different state other than California are all factors that she had to consider.</p>\n<p>“It was just kind of a feeling when I walked on campus,” Hudson said. “I saw the beach, they had my major and the girls on the team were just awesome. I was like ‘this is the school for me, this is where I want to spend the next four years of my life.’”</p>\n<p>Still, the life of a student athlete has rarely any time for relaxing. The constant practice, traveling, games and tournaments are all tasks that make finding the balance between school and sports difficult.</p>\n<p>Although coming to UCSB has undeniably been a great experience for Hudson, the time spent away from her family can be discouraging at times. Leaving her hometown for California has been the most challenging shift in her life. Not having the privilege to just pack up, leave and be home in a few hours is a disadvantage that occasionally takes a toll on the mind.</p>\n<p>“I don’t get to go home for Thanksgiving or long weekends, — I stay here,” Hudson said. “It’s really hard sometimes to see my friends go off and be with their families. I think that uprooting my whole life and moving down here without anybody else really made me grow up.”</p>\n<p>Despite not having any immediate family within the Santa Barbara area, it has been the connection with first-year Head Coach Serela Kay that has been beneficial in fully accommodating to the UCSB environment.</p>\n<p>Similar to Hudson, Kay made the decision to attend college out-of-state to play water polo at the collegiate level. An Annapolis, Maryland native, Kay played for St. Mary’s High School but left her hometown to become a four-year starter at UCLA.</p>\n<p>“I think our team is similar to how it was when I played. Our team is pretty tight,” Kay said. “Bryn lives with water polo players and they’re all close. That’s something that I definitely had when I was in school at UCLA. She’s got that on our team so that’s pretty cool.”</p>\n<p>Although winning championships and being a part of a reputable sports program are aspirations that collegiate athletes desire to play for, it’s the little things that tend to have the greatest impact.</p>\n<p>The various life lessons that sports teach athletes from their successes and failures help build character that contributes to making an impression both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, water polo has become more than just a game for Hudson: it has become a vital aspect of her life that has allowed her to improve as an overall person.</p>\n<p>“I think, more than anything, it has taught me to persevere and commit to things,” Hudson said. “There are definitely days where you wake up and you don’t feel good, you’re sick or you’re tired and you don’t want to go to practice, but you have to.”</p>\n<p>Life beyond the pool seems like the ideal place for these learned morals to be applied. As an aquatic biology major with an education minor, teaching is a possibility in Hudson’s future. But the Gauchos’ attacker is in no rush to leave school just yet, as she has one year of school left with plans of traveling once she graduates.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most important goal that Hudson desires to achieve is not anything that one could record on a stat sheet. Rather, being a genuine, loving individual that cares for others is a standard that comes before the game of water polo.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want people to remember me as a good, kindhearted person besides just being an athlete,” she said. “Whenever I step away from a situation, I want people to remember me in a positive way and remember that I was either kind to them or helped them out or made them laugh or feel good.”</p>\n<p>Occasionally, the uncertainty that comes with taking risks is just what a person needs to help them grow. While it is entertaining to watch college athletes and enjoy their talents, it is often more gratifying to appreciate their existence off the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 9, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I thought this was a good way to mesh the two and make a difference in the world using art.”</p>\n<p>On the court, Sullberg dominates as a starting middle blocker for the Gauchos. In her two seasons at UCSB, she has recorded 188 saves and 216 kills.</p>\n<p>Off the court, Sullberg finds her passion as an art major, and aspires to be an art therapist.</p>\n<p>“I think that being a student athlete has made me thrive in a busy schedule and learn how to balance my time,” Sullberg said. “That is one of the reasons why I think I am really able to get things going and make decisions and motivate myself to do this.”</p>\n<p>After accumulating over 4,000 dollars in arts supplies and raising 900 dollars via GoFundMe, Supply &amp; Create is looking to expand its impact by introducing on-campus drop boxes for UCSB students to donate their own art supplies to the cause. In addition, Sullberg hopes to eventually take this idea and turn it into a UCSB campus organization to create more positive change in the art education of Santa Barbara youth.</p>\n<p>Along with Sullberg, her volleyball teammate, sophomore outside hitter and libero Ali Spindt, is also actively involved with Supply &amp; Create. In the 2014 season, Spindt topped the conference leaderboard week after week in total digs and digs per set, ending her season averaging 2.81 digs per set and totaling 315.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important for kids to have the opportunity to express themselves artistically, and this was such a great idea from [Sullberg],” Spindt said. “It’s very rewarding.”</p>\n<p>In hopes to use the large number of resources the organization is exposed to due to its closeness with the UCSB athletics program, Sullberg and Spindt plan to use UCSB’s Student-Athlete Advisory Board to encourage participation from other Gaucho athletes.</p>\n<p>“This helps us because we can have a lot more resources,” Spindt said. “Having access to all the teams definitely helps a lot. We just put the bins out and we are trying to really get this going this quarter.”</p>\n<p>Most recently, the organization has received a donation of carpet squares from Art From Scrap, a Santa Barbara-based arts organization. Sullberg and Spindt plan to incorporate this donation into a “special projects” aspect of the program and allow students to work with all types of art media to further inspire creativity.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to get people on board,” Sullberg said. “Anyone that is interested in helping in any way would be awesome.”</p>\n<p>The recently added on-campus drop boxes can be found at the SRB, UCEN and ICA Building, as well as other potential locations. Supply &amp; Create is seeking help from the UCSB community. Students interested in being a part of this organization can contact Sullberg and Spindt at artistallie@yahoo.com.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of April 9, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62209\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62209\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/","id":1941,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[1940,1939,1938],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kevin Donohue: Persistence Personified","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_M-VBall_3.6_009-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_M-VBall_3.6_009-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Redshirt senior Kevin Donahue has overcome a number of obstacles to become the Gauchos' leader.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61939\" style=\"width: 313px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_M-VBall_3.6_009-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1086309335\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61930\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61939\" data-attachment-id=\"61939\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/eric_swenson_nexus_m-vball_3-6_009-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_M-VBall_3.6_009-web.jpg?fit=1068%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1068,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Kevin Donohue takes the second ball, setting an easy A.

Donohue was a redshirt sophomore at the time, just starting to earn consistent playing time in successive matches when all of a sudden, his season ended on one bad dive.</p>\n<p>Many other players would have had a negative attitude about the injury, but the economics and accounting major Donohue saw it as another obstacle to climb in order to become a better volleyball player. And now, as a co-captain in his senior season, he hopes to lead the Gauchos to a national championship.</p>\n<p>“Kevin does all the right things on and off the court. He is our captain and our emotional leader,” Assistant Coach Cullen Irons said. “He does everything he possibly can do to find success and we are happy to have that in Kevin.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The injury wasn’t Donohue’s first obstacle he had to overcome in order to become the player he is today. As a 6’3” outside hitter/opposite, he is consistently one of the shortest players on the court.</p>\n<p>In high school, Donohue was the star player of a Mira Costa High School volleyball team that won four Bay League Championships, as well as a CIF championship in 2008 and a California State championship in 2010; however, even with all of the success, it didn’t look like Donohue was going to have the opportunity to play volleyball in college until the summer after his senior year.</p>\n<p>It was during his club team’s run to a gold medal at the Junior Olympics his senior year that UCSB Head Coach Rick McLaughlin offered Donohue a walk on spot on the NCAA team only two months before enrolling in the school. Donohue was overcome with excitement and he knew that the opportunity was not one he would take for granted.</p>\n<p>“I knew being an undersized opposite at 6’3” that my options for playing in college would be limited,” Donohue said. “I didn’t try to worry too much about it; I knew that if my teams were winning and if I was doing well then something great would happen.”</p>\n<p>Sitting on the bench as a redshirt his first year of college, Donohue had the opportunity to watch the UCSB men’s volleyball team go on a historic run to the national championship game. Though the season ended in heartbreak, Donohue learned so much from the older players. He has been passing down this wisdom to younger players ever since.</p>\n<p>In his freshman season, Donohue garnered limited playing time, and it was in his sophomore season that he started becoming a force on the court after learning how to play as an outside hitter and having to pass on every serve receive. But in one play, the success and playing time vanished.</p>\n<p>With a dislocated shoulder, a torn labrum, and a partially torn rotator cuff, Donohue’s shoulder was basically useless right after the injury. He missed the remainder of his sophomore season and worked throughout the summer and fall in order to get back on the team his junior year.</p>\n<p>It was a frustrating time for Donohue, however, as he would go in waves of his arm feeling good and not being able to swing at all. This should not have surprised anyone as it was less than a year since the surgery, but Donohue wanted to be back on the court so badly and he did all he could to do so.</p>\n<p>In the end, he ended up spending most of the season watching from the sidelines, feeling the pain of losing to BYU in the MPSF Semifinals and wishing he could have been on the court making a difference.</p>\n<p>“The worst part about being injured is sitting on the sideline, not being able to help out your teammates and not being able to help UCSB get the win,” Donohue said. “Now that I’m back, when I’m out there, when I get the start, I try to enjoy being on the court, competing, as much as I can.”</p>\n<p>After not being one hundred percent healthy for his junior year, Donohue made it a priority to give his shoulder time to rest so he could make the most of his last season playing the sport he loves. He went an excruciatingly long summer without picking up a volleyball, instead strengthening his legs while working with trainers consistently to monitor his shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Kevin is a great leader. He has been through so much,” redshirt sophomore outside hitter Jacob Delson said. “He leads by example and he is a great guy to look up to… He is a smart player and he teaches us younger players a lot.”</p>\n<p>Now back at full strength, Donohue has surprised himself with leading the Gauchos in kills per set at 3.75. The Gauchos are currently 14–8 this season with eyes focused on a league championship, followed by a national title.</p>\n<p>“I know we have a great team right now and if we put ourselves in the right position, anything can happen,” Donohue said. “Our goal is to win out for the rest of the season and host a playoff game … when we are playing our best game we can beat anyone.”</p>\n<p>Donohue has battled adversity throughout his volleyball career and he hopes to end it holding a trophy above his two healthy shoulders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 15 of April 2, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/","id":2038,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[2037,2036,2035],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pedal Punk Comes to UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CirqueMechanics_Will-Tran-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CirqueMechanics_Will-Tran-2.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Campbell Hall will be home to Cirque du Soleil-type level of awesomeness this Sunday when Pedal Punk performs two shows Sunday.

After landing a sponsor in Mongoose, Chris began to tour the world with his company Mountain Dew Freestyle Performance Team, getting attention from <em>Cirque du Soleil.</em></p>\n<p>Eventually Chris founded <em>Cirque Mechanics</em>, putting together his background as a stage technician for <em>Cirque du Solei</em><em>l</em>, a BMX rider and circus performer. With their show, <em>Cirque Mechanics </em>performers make a unique change to the circus landscape, combining BMX biking with steampunk culture.</p>\n<p>“We build these Rube Goldberg devices, that are fun to watch” Lashua said. “The German Wheel rolls around with a built on roller on the bottom, which is connected for mobility”</p>\n<p>When thinking about the details for their new show, it was only logical that these mechanical contraptions would fit nicely in the pre-industrial revolution, the theory of steampunk.</p>\n<p>Rather than seeking to make a show that combined steampunk culture with circus acts, <em>Cirque Mechanics </em>simply realized that the genre fit perfectly with the show they were constructing.  One of the facets of the show is its ability to bring in a crowd of people with various interests, whether it be the mechanical aspect, the steampunk elements or the circus act itself.</p>\n<p>“Cirque Mechanics is a mechanical circus first and foremost” Lashua said. “Executing and building things, principles of lifts and force, principles of physics, shows the range [of the show] for the audience”</p>\n<p>The work is never over for Lashua and his company of performers, who are constantly tweaking their show in order to keep their reputation as a strong performance company.</p>\n<p>“We only remain relevant if [the performers] continue to grow, and stay fresh” Lashua said. “I’ll give a note on a thing, and that’s why the show remains relevant.”</p>\n<p>The performance will take place Sunday at 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. at Campbell Hall. Tickets for UCSB students are $15 and $25 for the general public.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

The veterans of these dominant teams have truly mapped out their own individual style as they prepare for what could be their last NCAA meet.</p>\n<p>“Everyone prepares differently for big meets,” senior sprinter Wade Allen said. “I myself tend to enjoy the weeks leading up as workouts get lighter which allows for more rest and recovery.”</p>\n<p>For athletes like Allen, who carries a heavy workload for his team and greatly contributes to their success, it takes a balanced mixture of mental and physical preparation to compete against the best swimmers in the conference for the title. He has surely faced them all individually, but to have them all in the pool at once knowing that they have all trained for that same moment of stepping on to the starting block is a notion that can distract the greatest of athletes.</p>\n<p>“In-season dual meets are routine. With championship meets comes great unpredictability,” Allen says. “It is important to keep your composure. Getting mentally prepared is a completely different game than the physical portion.”</p>\n<p>Their preparation varies from athlete to athlete. Redshirt senior breaststroker Katie Records takes a more traditional approach to get ready for the “Big One”.</p>\n<p>Both athletes claim to enjoy visualizing their race in the training leading up to the meet and when race time comes, but both also make sure that they do not overthink their strategies to a fault.</p>\n<p>Records finds a ritual in sporting her big swim jacket and hood, as she sits behind her future lane, to black out any possible distractions visually and focus on her lane. She always has her headphones in with pump-up music playing to disintegrate the audible distractions of every MPSF team cheering on their teammates.</p>\n<p>For senior sprinter Chris Dotson, a different strategy keeps him going when it comes time for the actual meet.</p>\n<p>“I swim my best when I’m extremely relaxed, smiling and high-fiving my buddies behind the blocks,” Dotson said. “Naturally you will go through waves of emotions and motivation throughout, and it is the ones who can handle the ups and downs that is ultimately determined the winner.”</p>\n<p>Dotson finds that he gets his drive and energy by feeding off of his teammates, who Records claims are the loudest on the deck. He finds that the momentum a team can build by hyping each other up and running with the energy not only gives them a physical boost, but also a mental edge over their opponents. This kind of motivation pushes him when he is in the spotlight and prevents him from doing what some athletes tend to do: crack under the pressure.</p>\n<p>All three athletes agree that the preparation leading up to the week of championships is as important as every aspect of the competition, but not maintaining this focus when race time comes nearly forfeits that preparation. Allen begins training and maintaining as early as five weeks before the meet, when the team is still in the regular season, but knows once he is on the deck it is purely about focus and energy. Records, winner of multiple Big West Athlete of the Week awards this season, knows the state she must be in to race.</p>\n<p>“I definitely get into a zone before all of my races,” Records says. “Maintaining focus throughout the meet is crucial for us and then the support of our teammates get us in the mindset to just race fast.”</p>\n<p>The physical preparation is all said and done now with the team currently residing in Los Angeles as the MPSF Championships have kicked off. The last five weeks of “tapering,” as they call it, has been completed and their bodies are in shape to go all out. All three Gauchos shared a common goal in mind before embarking on their trip south: bring home the gold.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of February 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Daniel is a beat writer for the UCSB swim and men’s tennis teams.

No matter how many records he breaks, at this point he’ll most likely never be able to say he has as many Super Bowl rings as his little brother Eli.</p>\n<p>So then, what does this Sunday mean for a guy like Tom Brady?</p>\n<p>Well, let’s refresh our memories for a second, because while Brady may be the league’s all-time winningest playoff quarterback, “All I Do Is Win” is not actually his theme song … though I wouldn’t be surprised if it were his ringtone.</p>\n<p>The wily 15-year vet has not won a Super Bowl since 2004, when he and his good pal Bill Belichick defeated the Philadelphia Eagles to win their ninth-consecutive playoff game and earn their third championship in four years.</p>\n<p>It’s been quite a journey for Brady since his triumphant entrance to the league. A number of first-round byes, two league MVPs, a severe season-ending knee injury while at the peak of his powers, a bunch of ridiculous touchdowns to Randy Moss and Rob Gronkowski and oh yeah … a 0-2 record in Super Bowls, with both losses coming to the New York Giants.</p>\n<p>If not for Peyton’s annoying little brother and David Tyree’s sticky helmet, Brady would probably be a much more obvious choice in the “greatest QB of all time” conversation. However, while just about everything has gone right for the NFL’s golden boy, from his Cinderella-like beginnings to his supermodel wife and maybe even one or two of his Ugg commercials, he still doesn’t have that fourth ring. Where’s Pau Gasol when you need him? … On second thought, those Ugg commercials are just bad.</p>\n<p>Yes, another ring would be fantastic. It would put Tom at the top of perhaps the most important list there is, alongside Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw in the four-timers club. But rather than thinking about how nice it would be to have so much bling you can justify putting a ring on your pinky, let’s think about what it would mean if Sunday doesn’t go Tom’s way.</p>\n<p>Another Super Bowl loss would make Brady a measly .500 all-time in the biggest game there is. It would give Russell Wilson his second ring in just his third year, making him the “new Tom Brady” of the league. It would mean no rings in 11 years, despite nine first-round byes and a ridiculous 20-7 postseason record.</p>\n<p>While I personally used to despise the guy ever since the infamous “Tuck Rule” incident, which forever branded him as a cheater in my childish brain (thanks, Spygate, for making it a reality), it is hard not to respect him for being the great winner and leader that he is. For someone as fiercely competitive as Tom Brady, failure is never an option. Even at 37 years old, anyone can still see the fire in his eyes every time he walks on the field.</p>\n<p>With a win, Brady will cement his place in history as one of the best of the best of the best. His career will have been brought full-circle, with championship banners spanning from one generation of football to the next. He will be forever remembered as one of the greatest competitors and winners the NFL has ever seen.</p>\n<p>With another loss, whether he deserves it or not, Brady will forever be remembered not as the guy who won three straight Super Bowls, but also as someone who lost three straight. Even for me, a Patriots hater, that seems like a pretty unfair legacy to have.</p>\n<p>No matter what happens though, can we just stop talking about Deflategate? Please?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Seahawks Making Their Mark on History</strong> by Edward Moss</p>\n<p>It’s the Seahawks versus the Patriots. The reigning champion versus the most recent dynasty. Carroll versus Belichick. Brady versus Wilson. Who would be the more fitting victor, the team that won three Super Bowls in four years but has lost in two championship games since, or the squad looking to add a chapter to a possible dynasty with a second straight title? Looking at the Seattle Seahawks, a win on Sunday could put this team on the verge of a new dynasty while acknowledging one of the greatest defensive teams of all-time.</p>\n<p>Russell Wilson, the starting quarterback of the reigning Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks has already had an amazingly successful career. One of the most successful third-round draft picks ever, last season he led his team to a 13-3 record in the regular season and a Super Bowl Championship over the Denver Broncos, 43-8. He is the shortest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl at 5’11” and now after his team went 12-4 in the regular season and beat the Carolina Panthers and Green Bay Packers to get to the title game, he has a shot to win his second championship before his 27th birthday.</p>\n<p>Pete Carroll enjoyed success at USC before becoming the Seahawks’ head coach in 2010. He won two national championships with the Trojans and after winning the Super Bowl last season, he is one of three coaches to win both a college national championship and a Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>At 62, Carroll was the third oldest coach to win a Super Bowl and he is attempting to become the 14th head coach to win multiple Super Bowl Championships.</p>\n<p>With a victory, Wilson and Carroll would be put into a similar conversation as Brady and Belichick as winning quarterback-head coach combos. A win would put them one Super Bowl victory behind the Patriots’ tandem, and this is a team that could be perennial contenders for years to come. We may be watching the second chapter in a future dynasty for the Seattle Seahawks and one of the more successful quarterback-head coach partnerships in NFL history.</p>\n<p>But the Seahawks didn’t win last year’s championship or get back to the Super Bowl this year just through its offense. This team has what is widely regarded as the best defense in the league. This defense finished first in the league in points allowed for the third straight season and had the second largest point differential in the league for the second straight year. Led by perennial Pro Bowlers cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas and strong safety Kam Chancellor, this defensive squad has the ability to shut down any offense in the league</p>\n<p>A win for the Seahawks would put them on the road to a dynasty. However, they are going up against the last team to win back-to-back Super Bowl championships, and a quarterback-head coach tandem that has lost its last two championship games and is desperate to end that streak.</p>\n<p>It won’t be easy for Seattle, but they have the opportunity to knock off the greatest franchise of the 21st century and put their name in the conversation to take over that accolade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of January 29, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

question on everyone’s mind heading into Sunday is whether Tom Brady will show up or if he’ll pull a “Peyton” against this well respected defense. Coincidentally enough, it seems that the only time this HOF quarterback doesn’t show up for the February bowl game is when he is playing against the other Manning, and luckily for him, he isn’t this time. Instead, he will be taking on a much tougher opponent in the Legion of Boom.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas and Byron Maxwell have had their share of chances to beat up offenses this season.

Where they seem to struggle is on the long balls, but luckily for them, that is something that Brady does not do very often.

This man is going into his sixth Bowl with the same franchise and head coach he’s had his whole career, and I highly doubt that he is looking to lose his third straight.</p>\n<p>If there is anyone in this league that can break up this strong defense, then it is definitely Brady. Unfortunately, the Patriots have just about the worst receiving core in the league besides Seattle, which doesn’t give him many options besides tight end Rob Gronkowski, his best receiver.</p>\n<p>Regardless of having nobody to pass to except Brandon Lafell and Danny Amendola, this QB has still gotten his usual passing number and has once again taken his offense to the last game of the season.  He has defeated top passing defenses this year like Cincinnati, Denver, Indianapolis and Buffalo twice. Rumors have it that injuries may affect both Sherman and Thomas and it is almost a guarantee that Brady will look to expose them on Sunday. It takes a madman to bet against this QB/Head Coaching duo.</p>\n<p>Defenses do win championships, but legendary players conquer all.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Patriots</p>\n<p><strong>Russell Wilson vs. Patriots Secondary</strong> by Sean White</p>\n<p>After an undoubtedly heroic performance in the Seattle Seahawks’ triumphant 28-22 comeback win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship, quarterback Russell Wilson is just one win away from leading his team to another Super Bowl victory.</p>\n<p>But he must first find a way to surpass a New England Patriots secondary that has been playing lockdown defense since the postseason began. In just two playoff games, the Patriots have a total of four interceptions and even held the Indianapolis Colts’ quarterback Andrew Luck to just 126 passing yards in the AFC Championship.</p>\n<p>With arguably one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL in Darrelle Revis, the Patriots automatically have an advantage coming into Sunday’s matchup. His ability to isolate and remove wide receivers from games by placing them on “Revis Island” can take away from a quarterback’s passing.</p>\n<p>Additionally, former Seahawk and “Legion of Boom” member Brandon Browner may be able to inform New England’s secondary with some insight on how to contain Russell Wilson.</p>\n<p>Although the Patriots may be able to limit Wilson’s amount of pass completions, they must be able to stop him outside of the pocket. His capability to scramble and make plays under pressure may be the most underrated aspect of this game. Wilson’s dual-threat skill set is what will allow the Seahawks to repeat as NFL champions. Expect a Seattle win as he proves yet again why he is so “DangerRuss.”</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Bill Belichick vs. Pete Carroll</strong> by Sarah Stigers</p>\n<p>Trying to debate whether Bill Belichick or Pete Carroll will fare better in the Super Bowl is much like debating which is the lesser of two evils in my book, because if you are not a Patriots or Seahawks fan, you probably are not too fond of either team.</p>\n<p>However, putting personal preferences aside, these two teams got to the Super Bowl because they rely on those two evils — and ultimately, it was coaching that elevated both teams to Championship level.</p>\n<p>Let’s start this off by saying my money is on the Seahawks. Pete Carroll and the gang are coming off of an emotional victory over the Packers in the NFC Championship game. I think that any team will have a hard time upsetting that game flow, but I think if someone is going to give it a shot, it is going to be Belichick.</p>\n<p>Based on pure statistics in the NFL, there’s no questioning that the football genius that lies within Belichick’s brain is incredible, with three Super Bowl titles, six conference championships and 14 divisional championships. None of that, however, discredits the decoration Carroll received while he ran the USC empire.</p>\n<p>Carroll had nine years coaching in college football and emerged from his legacy with a .836 win percentage, on top of a 7-2 Bowl game record. Ignoring his short stint with, ironically, the Patriots in the late 90s, since his re-entry into the NFL in 2010, he already has one Super Bowl title with the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>I think the deeper team going into Sunday is the Patriots, and it is obvious that Belichick knows exactly how to play his stars in every aspect that he can. Belichick is no stranger to a strong defense, and he runs a tight special teams. Those two aspects are what win Super Bowls.</p>\n<p>It is very rare that a team can win two straight titles, and when it comes down to coaching, Carroll is a man that craves a legacy no matter where it takes him, whereas Belichick is a coach that will stick to his team.</p>\n<p>Where usually the latter mindset is what drives a team to be a cohesive and well-oiled machine, in this situation, I think the Pats know that this Super Bowl is not the end for them. They still have the legs to go for a few more years. Quarterback Tom Brady is a monster and Gronkowsi’s youth keeps the team fresh. The Patriots will simply not stop being good after this game.</p>\n<p>Though I cannot say this with certainty, I truly believe that same statement does not go for the Seahawks. This Super Bowl is Seattle’s chance of going down in history. I think Carroll will chase that dream through Sunday night and do everything it takes to achieve that goal.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Marshawn Lynch vs. Patriots Run Defense</strong> by Martin Cobos</p>\n<p>Marshawn Lynch may be a man of few words, but his polarizing running style has been the topic of conversation since he entered the league in 2007.</p>\n<p>“Beast Mode,” as he is known around Seattle, has perfected the art of letting his performance do the talking. So in true Marshawn fashion, we shall leave the hype alone and simply let statistics tell the story.</p>\n<p>Lynch is widely known as one of the most powerful running backs in the game today and for good reason. This season, he broke an NFL leading 109 tackles. Compare this to DeMarco Murray who finished in second place with 38 fewer broken tackles despite 117 more attempts.</p>\n<p>This bruising style of running helped Lynch lead the league in yards up the the middle this season. When Lynch is able to get at least 20 carries or break off a 20-yard run, the Seahawks are 24 games over .500. When neither of these instances occurs, the Seahawks are a mere one game over .500.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the ball, the Patriots have vastly improved their run defense this season. In 2013, the Patriots allowed a staggering 134.1 rushing yards per game, which ranked 30th in the league.</p>\n<p>This year, however, they rank in the top ten of the league, allowing just 104.3 rushing yards per game. The Patriots have carried their tough run defense into the playoffs as they have allowed only one rushing touchdown and have not let an opponent break off a 20-yard run this postseason. The Seahawks surely hold the advantage in this matchup with one of the most prolific running backs in the game, but the Patriots’ enhanced run defense will not go down without a fight.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Rob Gronkowski vs. Kam Chancellor</strong> by Mark Salay</p>\n<p>Tight end Rob Gronkowski is the Patriots’ biggest threat in the passing game and the amount of times New England can get him involved will be critical for the passing game. Gronkowski is such a big, physical player (6’6”, 265 lbs.), he uses his frame to beat defenders to the ball.</p>\n<p>Seattle’s strong safety Kam Chancellor, however, matches up well with Gronk and will be the one in charge of containing him. Chancellor, listed at 6’3”, 232 lbs., is just as physical and big to keep up with the tight end.</p>\n<p>One thing Chancellor absolutely needs to do to win this matchup is stop Gronkowski at the line of scrimmage, because he is such a force in the open field and Tom Brady will definitely find him.</p>\n<p>If the Patriots get to the red zone, then Chancellor will also have to take away the slant route New England uses to target its playing-making tight end.<br>\nGronkowski will get his looks, but Kam needs to win the majority of the battles for Seattle to gain the upper hand. So who will come up on top? Well, we’ll see soon enough.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Toss-up</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 10 and 11 of January 29, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60243\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60243\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/","id":2032,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2031,2030,2029],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Divisional Round: Matchups and Predictions","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sports editor Michael Jorgenson gives his predictions on what could be one of the most exciting Divisional Playoffs in recent memory.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>No. 6 Baltimore Ravens @ No. 1 New England</strong></p>\n<p>No matter what team they have to work with, Brady and Belichick have continued to find success.

Aaron Rodgers is the biggest question mark entering the game, but says he’s ready to go for this one. Both teams are formidable when it comes to the passing or running game, making this is a likely candidate for highest scoring game of the weekend. America’s team may have the edge if Rodgers is unable to fully perform.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Packers 35-24 Cowboys</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 8, 2014’s print

and athletes entered the record books, 2014 will be remembered for what transpired off the field.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 2, the Seattle Seahawks claimed their first Super Bowl title by completely dominating Peyton Manning and the Broncos. 112.2 million viewers watched the game, the most watched program in U.S. history.</p>\n<p>The NFL was on top of the entertainment world and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was laughing all the way to the bank.

Goodell could have taken matters into his own hands and penalized Rice from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Instead, he opted suspending the Baltimore Raven for only two games, and not until video of Rice knocking out his fiancée was released for public viewing — creating a media firestorm and causing the league to lose sponsors — did Goodell take serious action.</p>\n<p>Then, a serious of other domestic violence cases surrounding more NFL players came to light and the league found itself in a public image crisis.</p>\n<p>Rice’s situation was only the tip of the iceberg. Early into the season, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was indicted for reckless or negligent injury to a child, that child being his four-year-old son. The child suffered from cuts, lacerations and bruises. He told authorities, “There are a lot of belts in Daddy’s closet.”</p>\n<p>What should have been a year in which we saw if the Seahawks could repeat and watched J.J. Watt dominate opposing teams, has been overcast by player conduct off the field.</p>\n<p>But the NFL wasn’t the only league this year to shy away from scandal. In April, recorded audio of Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks was released, causing outcry from fans, players and other people within the league.</p>\n<p>Unlike Goodell, new NBA commissioner Adam Silver realized the gravity of Sterling’s remarks and took the appropriate action against him, banning the owner from the league for life.</p>\n<p>That’s what separates the two commissioners. One is concerned solely with profits, while the other is aware of his league’s place in society and is taking a stance for what is right.</p>\n<p>Despite controversy off the field, there were truly inspirational moments that reinforced why we love sports so much. Take for instance Mo’ne Davis, a Little League pitcher from Philadelphia who became the first girl to throw a shutout in the Little League World Series. Her New Year’s resolution: keep on throwing like a girl.</p>\n<p>Or how about Derek Jeter’s final farewell at Yankee Stadium. The 20-year veteran ended his legendary career with a game-winning hit in the bottom of the ninth inning. At that moment, one play captured the essence of a brilliant career.</p>\n<p>In Division III women’s college basketball, freshman Lauren Hill was diagnosed with brain cancer after committing to play for Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>With only a few months left to play, the NCAA decided to reschedule MSJ’s home opener so Hill could play. She had four points and said during the game, “Let’s not call this my last game. This is my first collegiate game.”</p>\n<p>So sports fans, although this might not have been the best year, keep in mind that for every league embarrassment there are a thousand more stories like Lauren Hill’s, and that’s what keeps us coming back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of December 4, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

It requires strong willpower, the right body type and the ability to stay healthy, all while getting noticed by college programs. It is a long and difficult road and many people will never get the opportunity to finish the ride. </p>\n<p>Now imagine being a Division One athlete for two sports. Sounds near impossible, right? Freshman Shane Hauschild is about to finish a stellar first season on the UCSB men’s water polo team and he will soon join the ranks of some of the most talented athletes as he takes on the challenge of playing for the UCSB men’s volleyball team in the same year.</p>\n<p>“When I tell people I’m going to play two sports here the look on their face is impressed, but also at the same time most of them say it’s gonna be a lot of work,” Hauschild said. “I want to try it this year and see if I can handle both sports and school. We’ll see about next year, but this year for sure I’m gonna try it.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hauschild is a born and bred Santa Barbara boy. He went to San Marcos High School and it was an easy decision for him to stay in the beautiful coastal town for college at UCSB. </p>\n<p>When he started practicing with the water polo team this summer, he joined a squad full of home-grown players that he had grown up watching and playing against. Junior utility Chase Racich and junior attacker Kevin Cappon played together at Dos Pueblos High school, while freshman defender Kenny Constantinides and senior utility Brendan McElroy both attended Santa Barbara High School.</p>\n<p>“I remember looking up to Kevin and Chase when I was a freshman in high school because they were on the varsity team at “‘DP’” and their team was super good,” Hauschild said. “I watched them play and it was on a whole other level. Now that I’m playing on a team with them is super crazy. They know a ton about the sport and they’ve taken me under their wing.”</p>\n<p>Hauschild has played a huge role on the water polo team this year. He leads the team with 27 goals and 43 points, when coming into the season he was happy just to be one of only two freshman to make the traveling squad, along with attacker Josh Jordan. While the team has had a down year, Hauschild’s emergence as a star has been the highlight of the season.</p>\n<p>“Shane played a huge role on our team this year. He has a crazy pump-fake and an excellent shot,” Racich said. “Once he gets a little stronger and starts shooting more he could become one of the best players in the country.”</p>\n<p>After playing soccer his entire life, Hauschild decided to play water polo his freshman year of high school after seeing his younger sister play. He made the team and fell in love with the sport from the beginning. </p>\n<p>Blessed with a six foot, five inch frame, he was also able to play an integral part on the San Marcos volleyball team in the spring, giving him a chance to use different muscles and get out of the water for another sport that he both enjoys and excels at.</p>\n<p>After committing to UCSB on a water polo scholarship, Hauschild contacted UCSB’s head volleyball coach Rick McLaughlin to get him to come out and watch Hauschild play for San Marcos. Playing outside hitter, Hauschild impressed McLaughlin and he was given a spot on the Division One team.</p>\n<p>With the water polo season coming to a close this weekend at the MPSF tournament, Hauschild is still fully involved with the water polo team, but he will soon be joining the volleyball team for its winter practices. He plans to practice with the team, hoping to earn a spot on the traveling squad, but he remains  committed to water polo over any other sport.</p>\n<p>“As soon as polo is over I’m gonna start practicing with [the volleyball team],” Hauschild said. “I haven’t touched a volleyball since polo started so I’m gonna be pretty rusty. If I was transitioning back to playing at a high school level it wouldn’t be too bad, but this is a whole other level so it’s definitely gonna be interesting.”</p>\n<p>Many athletes could only dream of being in Hauschild’s shoes.
