Great moments in sports photography sometimes happen in less than one one-thousandth of a second. Within that extremely narrow time frame, given the proper equipment and timing (one part skill, two parts serendipity), a photographer can capture the essentials of story-telling with a photograph. An athlete’s pose and facial expression are obvious components of a good shot. Underrated but also important in composing a picture that engages the reader and complements a story are the little details. For instance, when the flakes of powder a snowboarder kicks up or the chunks of rubber a soccer player disrupts on a turf field. The same little details, such as a runner casually spitting as she races, can disqualify a photo from being front page material, unless perhaps the story was on the new trend of tobacco chewing on the womens’ cross country team.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31767\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31767\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/","id":2159,"author":{"id":326,"name":"Jon Kopecky"},"related":[2158,2157,2156],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Divisional Playoff Preview: Jets v.

Intriguing matchups to watch for during this game come straight from the line of scrimmage. Three-hundred-twenty-five-pound Patriot defensive lineman Vince Wilfork will line up against Jets lineman Nick Mangold, while the other side of the ball hosts a faceoff between perennial pro-bowlers Jason Taylor of the Jets and Patriot lineman Matt Light. The outcome of these matchups will significantly affect each team’s offensive strategy, and the final score of the game.</p>\n<p>After a 45-3 decimation of the Jets earlier this season, New England will continue to rely on its offensive line to protect Brady in the pocket, who hasn’t had a turnover in the past 11 games and has led New England to score at least 31 points per game since Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>The Jets’ defense will need to increase its output from the game against the Colts, in which New York safety Eric Smith led the team with 10 tackles. It’s important to remember that though New England smashed the Jets by 42 points in their last meeting, New York did beat the Patriots in the first matchup for these two teams earlier this year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Jets coach Rex Ryan said, maybe Tom Brady doesn’t “study” as much as Peyton Manning.

This is a classic smash mouth, all-out brawl between two of the toughest defenses in the league. Ravens versus Steelers has been a close and entertaining contest for the past decade, and this one is sure to bring more of the same. Dating back to last season, the last four games have been split by the two teams, each decided by a single field goal. There isn’t a more tightly contested match up in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>The Steelers have home-field advantage, but the Ravens are notorious for winning on the road, with a 4-2 record in road playoff games since Joe Flacco has been their starting quarterback. Each team has won on the other’s home field this season.</p>\n<p>These teams hate each other, so I fully expect to see a few players injured and for one or two scuffles to break out. In their previous meeting, Baltimore’s mammoth of a defensive tackle Haloti Ngata broke Steeler’s quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s nose. Big Ben stayed in the game and led his team to a comeback win over its division rival.

Roddy White was my best wide receiver. Together, they’re magic. While two players don’t make up an entire football team, they’re still too much for the Packers secondary, which dominated Eli Manning and Jay Cutler during the final two games of the regular season but has fared poorly against teams with high-quality wideouts. The game might be close initially, but if Falcons’ running back Michael Turner shows up and forces Green Bay to focus on stopping the run, the Falcons QB/WR duo will be too much for the Packers to handle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Packers may have one of the best quarterbacks in the game in Aaron Rodgers, but they lack the depth of the Falcons, they’re playing on relatively tired legs after upsetting the Eagles last week, and they’re playing on the road.

However, the story stops this Sunday as Seattle’s magic is going to run out against Da Bears. Chi-town is simply a better team. Jay Cutler is having a solid season, throwing for 23 touchdowns against just 16 interceptions, while Matt Forte posted a 1,000-yard rushing season again. Seattle must try to contain the “electrifying” Devin Hester, who is as fast in real life as he is in Madden. Chicago’s key to success, though,  relies on its defense’s ability to stop the “stupid fast” Marshawn Lynch.</p>\n<p>“Beast Mode” had a solid performance in last week’s playoff game, running for 131 yards last week over 19 carries against the Saints. He stole the show with his 67-yard touchdown run, where he broke six tackles and had an incredible stiff-arm that was downright legend… wait for it … dary, and will be on the highlight reel for years to come. However, he is the only real offensive threat on an otherwise subpar playoff team. Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck had the game of his life, throwing four touchdowns against the Saints. However, Hasselbeck threw only 12 touchdown passes all season to go with 17 interceptions.  The odds of Hasselbeck replicating his wildcard performance are lower than the chance of him being struck by lighting again*.  The Bears win this game, booking their ticket to the NFC Championship game.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Bears over Seahawks, 20-14</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Jersey’s major threat? That they will turn around and deal Carmelo to the Knicks, which, given the Knicks recent success, seems about as likely as Woody Allen appearing nude in Playgirl.</p>\n<p>Why make this trade? Carmelo is a big-name superstar and Mikhail Prokhrov has been dying to make a splash ever since he bought the moribund Nets franchise. The prospect of moving the Nets to Brooklyn with a marquee player to bate Knicks fans with is tempting, but is it really worth raiding the cupboard of the Nets’ young talent and future first-round picks just to bring in a player that has never proven that he’s more than just a piece of the championship puzzle? Ripping the backbone of your franchise out for King James is one thing, but — as the 2005-08 Lakers proved — having one high-volume scorer and surrounding him with dross is a recipe for a first-round exit rather than a winning formula.</p>\n<p>Carmelo is a nice player who may deserve the superstar designation, but he’s suffered a Vince Carter-like plummet in productivity this season. If he isn’t scoring 28 points per game and shooting at least 45 percent (to go along with his usual stellar rebounding), then he isn’t worth the $65 million over three years that the Nets would pay for him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Nuggets seem like the clear winners in this trade, although they would probably benefit from flipping Devin Harris in the offseason for a wing scorer, handing the reins over to Ty Lawson and seeing if the waterbug point guard from North Carolina can’t replicate Raymond Felton’s New York rebirth in the Rocky Mountains. Denver was a championship contender a few seasons ago, running into the Lakers buzzsaw and torpedoing its chances mainly because of its comical lack of frontcourt depth. This trade would solve that issue, bringing in promising big man Derrick Favors and a raft of draft picks that, even with a lockout looming, are sure to be full of high-quality talent.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the Nuggets can afford to wait until June 30 to flip Carmelo to whomever they prefer. The market for his services isn’t going anywhere. Since he has an early termination option rather than an expiring contract, they will hold his rights until that date and be free to trade him wherever they choose.</p>\n<p>Holding the deal on the backburner makes sense because Denver might want to see where this nucleus can take them in the playoffs. Now that the team is fully healthy, all it has to do is wait for the inevitable Andrew Bynum knee injury and they may have just enough juice to squeak past the Lakers into the championship. Beating Miami once they get there is another matter.</p>\n<p>It’s also in the best interest for the Nets to keep losing. Like, a lot. The more the Nets lose, the better the picks the Nuggets receive will be. That’s why the most likely scenario is that the Nuggets hang onto Carmelo until the last possible second before trading him outright, especially given his reluctance to sign an extension with the Nets. If it plays out that way, I envision the Nets pulling their offer and allowing Melo to sign with the Knicks on July 1. At least, I hope it plays out that way.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Artsweek <em>Editor Michael Hafford thinks that if  ’Melo still had cornrows this never would’ve happened.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/","id":2155,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[2154,2153,2152],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How to Train Your Sports Editor: One Man’s Quest to Get Back Into Shape","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As you can see by my measurements, I’m not exactly the thickest fellow.

She’s registered over 800 wins, has been with the women’s program since it started and has done color commentary for ESPN. Her nickname is “The Queen,” for God’s sake. Basically, she’s far too qualified to teach me how to play this sport. So far, she’s given me the biggest physical challenge of the three coaches. Those backline-to-net shuffles are killers. But she’s also the loudest, funniest and most charismatic teacher so far. She jokingly yelled at a kid the other day and he looked like he was going to cry. Awesome. Plus volleyball is made for tall people, and I’m tall. No worries here.</p>\n<p><strong>Mircea Badulescu – Elementary Soccer</strong></p>\n<p>A childhood full of golf gave me hand-eye coordination. Foot-eye, not so much. I am also not much of a runner despite my gazelle strides, nor am I very agile. On top of that, this class consists of nothing but playing soccer. No drills, no pointers, just the game. Badulescu seems cool enough, but I don’t anticipate much interaction because he observes rather than teaches. That being said, he has a cool accent, which is a big plus. The wildcard in the bunch, to say the least.</p>\n<p><strong>Charlotte Scatliffe – Intermediate Tennis</strong></p>\n<p>The first ESS class I took at UCSB was beginning tennis. I had no prior skills, but that class was such a fun experience that I decided to take another. Plus, probably due to the hand-eye coordination thing, I had a little bit of a knack for it. That being said, tennis is hard. There’s a lot of stopping and starting again and turning and starting involved. Don’t even get me started on the serves. Scatliffe is the current assistant coach for women’s tennis, and was a player herself from 2004 to 2008. She has youth on her side, which is good in a teacher. We play fun games, she’s already developed a rapport with some kids and is very personable. Spunky, even. But … tennis is hard, man.</p>\n<p>So that’s the rundown. One week in, and I like to think I already feel a little better. Eating ice cream for dinner and downing my fair share of pitchers at Gio’s can’t be helping, but I’m committed to this. I promise to share with you my emotional and physical journey upon which I venture to exchange my man flab for a six pack. Or maybe I’ll just stick with the six-pack of Blue Moons in my fridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-10/train-sports-editor-mans-quest-shape/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-10/train-sports-editor-mans-quest-shape/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-10/train-sports-editor-mans-quest-shape/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-10/train-sports-editor-mans-quest-shape/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-10/train-sports-editor-mans-quest-shape/","id":2905,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2904,2903,2902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: Hope Floats, So Get Stoked","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Since my pre-pubescent years, I’ve wanted to pickle my feet in ocean brine all over the world.

My inner surf bum is an anxious and neurotic man who wants to have a job that one day provides him with the cash to travel the world for surf and buy his future children wetsuits to start their stoke. For now, I have to do something to stave off the surf withdrawals. My answer is surf porn.</p>\n<p>There’s a range of paraphernalia you can access by passing grubby Surfer magazines between roommates, perusing a pristine copy of The Surfer’s Journal at shops on the sly, or by downloading some good ol’ fashioned Surfline content. Perhaps you can catch a little voyeur action from a beach or balcony.</p>\n<p>Surf porn, though, is not the real thing.</p>\n<p>Still, your best way to experience the thrill of the paddle-out, the rush of the drop and the calmness of the tube is to indulge your imagination. Saturate your brain with salty spray and howling off-shores.</p>\n<p>Take a moment before you sleep and picture yourself climbing down a frigid rocky trail with a board under one arm, leash slung across a shoulder with your neoprene zipped tight all the way to the neck. Or picture a slabby day at Teahupoo in board shorts, a week of cobblestone point break perfection in Central America, an empty head-high set at Trestles or a two-foot wave at Devereaux, for example.</p>\n<p>At the moment, the surf flick playing in my head stars yours truly, cutting through a heavy Northern California paddle-out with ease, and charging massive hollow beach breaks, getting shack after shack after shack, barrels for miles just frothing out of my head, etc. You can see how it goes in my future — perhaps fictional — surf world.</p>\n<p>But maybe when you imagine it, your board is a towel next to a pool/hot tub combo overlooking a beach where drinks are catered along with vegetables and fruits and glitter and who knows what else.</p>\n<p>The point I am getting to here is that hope floats. The exact substance of your surf dreams doesn’t matter as much as the desire that propels your mental strokes.</p>\n<p>Don’t let the ripples in your brain become a placid lake. Stir things up. Send yourself some south swells to take away the dreariness of a foggy day in the library. Maybe one day that wish can be reality. And when it happens, the sensation won’t resemble the peeling apart of two pages of a surf magazine that have become stuck together … with wax.</p>\n<p>The pages of Daily Nexus surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld’s mind have become stuck together too, but not with wax.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/nuglets-wisdom-hope-floats-stoked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/nuglets-wisdom-hope-floats-stoked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/nuglets-wisdom-hope-floats-stoked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/nuglets-wisdom-hope-floats-stoked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/nuglets-wisdom-hope-floats-stoked/","id":2167,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2166,2165,2164],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One Blown Call, All Hopes Dashed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"That, my friends, is a punch.\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Video courtesy of Youtube user BigMikeUCSB:<br>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sHhk1DUpyw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>That, my friends, is a punch.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Gaucho soccer lost a second round NCAA playoff match to UC Berkeley, 2-1. But the story goes deeper than that. The match was mired in controversy for both teams, and volunteer Head Referee Mike Kampmeinert, a Folsom, Calif. Native, broke any ref’s golden rule by taking the game into his own hands. Regardless of the outcome, Sunday’s game highlights the issue of inconsistent officiating in college soccer, and something needs to be done about it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Here’s what I saw, and what the rest of the video shows in part: Gaucho midfielder Luis Silva comes in with an aggressive slide-tackle on the ball around the feet of UC Berkeley’s Servando Carrasco. After losing control of the ball, Carrasco shove-punches Silva above the neck and Silva goes down. Carrasco goes down as well, and both players are awarded cards. This is where the problems begin.</p>\n<p>Did Silva deserve a red card for the play? I don’t claim to know much about college soccer and the intricacies of its rules, but he certainly made a hard, physical play on the ball and it’s understandable for Carrasco to be angry in what was a heated match for both teams. But the red card forced UCSB to close out the next 75 minutes of the game a man down, and an important man at that. Honestly? I’m not sure if Silva’s behavior merited ejection or not. Carrasco’s case, on the other hand, is much simpler. Here’s the official NCAA rulebook’s take on fighting:</p>\n<p>12.6.1 Fighting. Definition:  A fight is defined as a deliberate strike or punch or an attempt to strike or punch another player, official, coach or bench personnel. These acts include, but are not limited to, kicking, head-butting, hair pulling or an open-handed strike if done deliberately and in a malicious manner.</p>\n<p>12.6.1.1 A player, coach or bench personnel shall be ejected if he or she is guilty of fighting or leaves the coaching area to participate in an altercation.</p>\n<p>The rules are clear. Carrasco should have been gone, at least making the game an even 10-on-10 with Silva’s red card. Despite Kampmeinert’s call, midfielder Michael Tetteh managed to put the undermanned Gauchos up 1-0 late in the game off of a throw in, and it seemed as if karma would take care of things, but it wasn’t to be.</p>\n<p>Carrasco returned to the center of the action with just two minutes remaining when he evened up the score after a handball was called in the box. He was awarded a penalty kick, which he buried, sending the match into overtime. I was sitting in the distant press box at the time, so I am no judge of the play, but sophomore midfielder Machael David tells me that the game tape shows no such violation. You can choose for yourself to take that or leave it.</p>\n<p>The controversy continued even after the final whistle blew in overtime, giving Cal the 2-1 victory and sending UCSB packing. Three Gauchos — David, Tetteh and midfielder Danny Barrera — charged the referee, and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg was forced to restrain his players in the chaos that ensued. Each was rightfully awarded a red card according to the above definition of fighting, and they may see further implications.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of dubious plays on Sunday, and I don’t claim to act as the definitive account as to what happened because I couldn’t clearly see a lot of them from the press box above the field. What I did see, from a very good vantage point in fact, was Vom Steeg’s press conference after the game.</p>\n<p>There, I saw a man that was visibly shaken by what had happened. His voice was hoarse, but his words were clear.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coaching Division I soccer for 12 years, and what I had to experience out there on the field was not fair for me, was not fair to my coaching staff, was not fair to my players. And I know exactly what I’m saying,” Vom Steeg said. “For $500 [to pay a referee], we can’t find somebody better? Really, we can’t? Five-hundred bucks? It’s not worth it to the players and the teams? I have a team that’s devastated, and there’s nothing that I can say.”</p>\n<p>On a day when a lot of players, Gauchos and Golden Bears alike, were wrong in their actions, Vom Steeg was right. The fact is, Kampmeinert took over the game and had an effect on its outcome. What’s more, he affected players who deserve the right to a game that is decided by those players and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Mistakes this egregious simply don’t happen in college football or basketball. The referees in the playoffs of those sports aren’t chosen based on how close they live to the match. College soccer’s governing bodies need to work to find a system that rotates referees, and only uses the most highly-rated ones in the most important matches.</p>\n<p>David called me the morning after the game, saying he was unable to sleep or go to class, that he felt as if a part of his soul was taken away. He said that calls like those would never stand in his native Africa or in Europe and even suggested corruption in a bad system was what robbed his team of a real chance at a national title. Senior defender Michael Boxall, whom I’ve never known to speak disparagingly of refs, said it was as if Cal had 12 players on the field, one with a whistle. Even Big Mike of the Gaucho locos had to be consoled by Chancellor Yang afterward.</p>\n<p>NCAA soccer is missing an important opportunity because of the standards for officiating. To have UCSB — the most important West Coast team by its sheer number of fans — in the College Cup would be huge for soccer in America. People would be able to see a college-level program that has incredibly devoted followers. Gaucho fans on Sunday were far louder than the Berkeley fan base, and that was just a tiny sampling of what this school has to offer. I’m not suggesting that the win be handed to the Gauchos, but they deserve a fair shot at it, something they certainly didn’t get.</p>\n<p>David, Tetteh and Barrera were absolutely wrong to react as they did. Carrasco was wrong to throw a punch as he did. Referee Kampmeinert was wrong, too. The match will go down in Gaucho soccer history as a loss, and that’s the bottom line. But when people look at that in the future, they’re missing a big story about three seniors — goalkeeper Sam Hayden, forward Joe Eubanks and Boxall — who finish their careers in Blue not with their heads held high, but in shock. This is a story about a team that was literally constructed over the last few years for the purpose of making a championship run this year at Harder Stadium. In sports losing is losing, and that’s tough sometimes. But Sunday’s match, on both sides of the ball — I’m not sure should even be called sport, because that would require an outcome based on athletic performance, not a conveniently located referee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/","id":2898,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2897,2896,2895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: It’s About More than Just Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Most owners would say a good fantasy day is any day you get to put another check mark in the win column.

On the surface, it was a very solid 90-80 win in which Hines Ward got me 19 points. But even then I could see the danger signs. Four of my players scored under 10 points, and my second and third top scorers were my defense and my kicker.</p>\n<p>When you rely on those positions to win games for you, you are essentially relying on luck and on your opponent’s negligence when it comes to setting his or her roster.</p>\n<p>As it happened, luck played a large role. My opponent’s defense got him -3 points after having performed fairly well in the weeks prior, and one of his running backs, LeSean McCoy, had an off day. So even though I got the win, I had little reason to be happy about my team’s performance.</p>\n<p>A week later I had another close win, this time 99-87, but the same problems plagued me. My three top scorers were BenJarvus Green-Ellis, who got me 24 points, Calvin Johnson, who got 28 points, and, for the second straight week, my kicker, Sebastian Janikowski, who got 15 points. Five of my nine players scored six points or fewer, and once again my win came down to luck that my opponent chose not to start Matthew Stafford, who got 24 points that day, opting instead to start Tom Brady, who got 13.</p>\n<p>The next week it became clear that my luck was up. My top three scorers got me 16, 11 and 10 points and the number two scorer was Janikowski once again. The rest of my players got me eight points or fewer, and the only reason I managed to scrape out a 60-50 win was because the only player on my opponent’s team who got him over seven points was his quarterback.</p>\n<p>And that brings us back to the point where my luck finally ran out. I knew it was going to happen eventually. I was not surprised to find that, after getting me a total of six points over the past two weeks, Hines Ward put up a goose egg, or that Larry Fitzgerald, who had one strong showing all season, only mustered 11 points against a decent Seahawks defense.</p>\n<p>I saw this loss coming based on the way I was getting my wins. I was riding the coattails of a few players while the rest of my team attempted to drag me down. A winning season is built on consistently strong performances from the entire team. Those days are good fantasy days, even if they result in a loss. A strong loss means you suffered from bad luck, and it is likely that you will rebound. A weak win, however, usually is the result of a weak team, and foreshadows losses.</p>\n<p>That is why a win does not always equal a good fantasy day. A good day is made from a strong team performance that does not appear to be a fluke. And if your team can’t give you that, you better hope luck is on your side.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: Matt Cassel, QB, Kansas City Chiefs. He’s available in 60 percent of leagues and is averaging 15 points over the last five games. However, the fantasy playoffs are coming up in a few weeks, and it’s time to start preparing. If you’re in and want to stock up or you’re right on the edge and need something to push you over, then instead of over-searching through a depleted waiver wire, make a trade with a team that is out of contention. It’s more likely that you’ll find what you need there.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg knows just how to judge a good fantasy day, if you know what I mean.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Her mother, Debbie Green, who played volleyball at USC, is a former Olympic silver medalist and the Long Beach State assistant coach of 23 years. At Long Beach, she coached her oldest daughter, Dana’s older sister Nicole, who was a setter as well. Additionally, Dana’s father Joseph Vargas is a former two-time Olympian for the USA water polo team.</p>\n<p>“Coming from a family like that, I was obviously influenced a lot,” Vargas said. “They really helped me take advantage of the opportunities I had in front of me, and I am very grateful.”</p>\n<p>“Dana has had a lot of pressure on her because of her family and their success in athletics,” Gregory said. “She was always expected to perform, and she has. She handles the pressure like a pro and is always focused.”</p>\n<p>Nicole, who plays volleyball professionally in France, is the root of much of the competitive spirit that Dana possesses. The two would battle endlessly, competing in everything from sports to  board games growing up.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of one time I beat my older sister in anything,” Vargas said. “Not in volleyball, any sports, or even Monopoly. Ever since I was little I have had a really competitive spirit and wanted to win everything, but for some reason, she would always beat me.”</p>\n<p>It is safe to say that Vargas feels right at home in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I love Santa Barbara,” Vargas said. “My teammates and coaches are awesome, the atmosphere is amazing, and the weather isn’t too bad either.”</p>\n<p>For a player whose career will be forever marked in Gaucho volleyball history, Vargas was dangerously close to committing to University of Miami over UCSB as a high school senior.</p>\n<p>“At first I didn’t even want to come on a visit but my mom forced me to,” Vargas confessed. “Kathy and I connected on a player-coach level and two days later I called [Kathy] to commit here. To this day I know that I made the best decision for me.”</p>\n<p>Vargas stormed onto campus, making an immediate impact in one of the most impressive freshman seasons in school history. The freshman setter played in all 52 matches and dished out 1,381 assists — good for ninth all time in a single season at UCSB. Vargas ranked fifth in the Big West with her 11.51 assists per set as her play earned her Big West All-Freshman team honors.</p>\n<p>“I recruited [Dana] to be the starter right away,” Gregory said. “I was not really surprised when she came in and played well right away. She is extremely talented and focused and I knew what she was capable of.”</p>\n<p>In her first ever match for the Gauchos, Vargas lived up to, if not exceeded, her coach’s expectations. She tallied 61 assists against San Diego State that game — one shy of her career-high set earlier this season against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“I remember that first match really well,” Vargas said. “Unfortunately we lost in five, which was a bummer, but that really boosted my confidence and showed that I belonged. It set the tone for the rest of my season.”</p>\n<p>Although Vargas played well individually, her first few seasons at UCSB did not go so well, with the team finishing below .500 in each of her first two seasons at Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Those first few seasons, we didn’t do very well as a team, and I took that kind of hard,” Vargas said. “I’m such a competitive person, so it got to me a little.”</p>\n<p>Vargas’ list of career accolades is not a short one. Last season as a junior, Vargas was named an American Volleyball Coaches Association All-American Honorable Mention and received First Team All-West Region and First Team All-Big West honors. Her 1,297 assists last year were also tops in the Big West and her average of 10.90 assists per set ranked her #2 in the Big West and 40th in the nation.</p>\n<p>Apart from the impressive statistics she continues to compile on the court, Vargas’ leadership is the key. For anyone watching a Gauchos volleyball game, it is clear that Vargas is the team captain. Always vocal and encouraging, Vargas is constantly pumping up her team, being a verbal leader on the court.</p>\n<p>“It has been a great experience to play with Dana,” senior outside hitter Charlene DeHoog said. “I have watched her grow and mature as a player and grow as a person these past four years. She is a natural born leader and has so much confidence on the court.”</p>\n<p>Another noticeable characteristic of Vargas is her passion. Self-described as feisty, Vargas more than makes up for her lack of size at 5’7” with her intensity.</p>\n<p>“I love her aggressive personality,” Gregory said. “Her leadership and passion make the whole team better. She always plays her hardest and is always in control, which is important for a setter and team leader.”</p>\n<p>After graduating in the spring with a degree in sociology and a minor in history, Vargas plans to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and go to Europe to play professionally.</p>\n<p>“Dana is an awesome person,” DeHoog said. “She will succeed in life because she is so reliable and such a great leader.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will close out its 2010 campaign on the road this weekend at UC Riverside. For Vargas, it will be her final match in a Gaucho uniform, the culmination of four years of hard work for Vargas.</p>\n<p>“My experience here has been amazing,” Vargas said. “Kathy is one of the few coaches who truly cares about each of her players and what happens to them after college. I am so fortunate, and UCSB and the athletic program have been so amazing to my team and me. They have made my experience something to remember.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29938\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29938\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/","id":2893,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2892,2891,2890],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: I’m a Lifer, and Not Just for the Ass","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Congratulations to Betzaida Herrera, the World Miss Reef 2010 Bikini Contest Champion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Congratulations to Betzaida Herrera, the World Miss Reef 2010 Bikini Contest Champion.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, congratulations to Miss Reef judges Rob Machado, Parker Coffin and Dean Morrison, who qualified as bootythorities through their prodigious surf talents.</p>\n<p>Talk about living the dream: The list of perks and the adventures that top surfers have earned and embarked on is enviable, or sometimes just kinda bizarre, like when Kelly Slater dated Pamela Anderson and moonlit on Baywatch for a season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Don’t you unenlightened landlubbers get anything?</p>\n<p>Surfing is not about the babes, being able to boost air or getting a tanned bod. Surfing is not about the contests, the World Championship Tour or corporate sponsorship. It’s not even about Betzaida’s mouthwatering heiny.</p>\n<p>There’s real magic to the sport of kings. When you submerge yourself in surfing’s depth, waves become your spiritual fuel. The rhythmic bob of the tide is your pulse. Paddling is your breath, the spray of saltwater your speech.</p>\n<p>I’ve met people fifty years my senior who can surf with more skill, patience and style than myself. I’ve read accounts and seen videos of surfers in their 80s and 90s still going strong. They’re the inspired ones, the people I aspire to be. It’s not because they’ve become more used to balancing on their surfboard, more accurate at predicting waves or even more crafty at maneuvering the lineup, but because they’ve been able to keep the soul-buzzing feeling of the session in their lives even past their physical prime.</p>\n<p>There’s a certain delighted twinkle that manifests in the eyes of lifelong surfers. It’s almost an “I know something you don’t know” kind of jesting taunt. But when that soul surfer happens to talk about his or her experiences and smile — a smile that connects the whole mouth and eyes into a portrait of bubbly excitement — you begin to understand what a lifetime of soul adventure can do for one’s spirit.</p>\n<p>If you do it right, surfing will fulfill you, provide you purpose, bliss, satisfaction, exercise, community and challenge. The first step is entering the water with an open mind. The next step is to return to the water frequently. The final step is to stay positive and grateful to have at least a moment to float by yourself, with your buds or perhaps just the dolphins and fish.</p>\n<p>So don’t “what if” your surfing prospects. Don’t “I could’ve been a surfer had I started earlier”  yourself. Just give it a try, stay respectful and stay at it.</p>\n<p>Remember — it’s right there, and it’s good for you.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld was very disappointed with his second-place finish in the ass contest.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29944\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29944\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/","id":2892,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2891,2890,2889],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: Musings from the NFL’s Week 10","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"From a great NFL season that just keeps giving and giving, here are a few observations from last week:","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>From a great NFL season that just keeps giving and giving, here are a few observations from last week:</p>\n<p>Brett Favre</p>\n<p>The 41-year-old followed up last week’s personal career best passing performance (446 yards) with a blunder at Chicago.

Pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>Troy Smith</p>\n<p>Just to satisfy all you 49er fans, here is the part where I write a couple of sentences about how good Troy Smith looked on Sunday. About how, as opposed to a certain other SF QB with the same last name, he actually looked like he was trying. How he brought a confidence and swagger to the offense, especially at the end of the game. How he threw for 356 yards — something Alex Smith failed to do for the Niners in 50 games as starter. Now Smith (Troy, that is) should be the starter going forward.</p>\n<p>And finally, here is the part where to the pleasure of Niner fans, I say that San Francisco — who is only two games behind first place Seattle — can take the NFC West this year, in which pathetically no team in the division has a positive point differential at the moment.</p>\n<p>Michael Vick</p>\n<p>Vick looked unbelievable Monday night. In a 59-28 crushing of the Redskins, he became the first player in the NFL with 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards, four passing TDs and two rushing TDs. Wow. He is 4-0 as a starter this year, and if he continues this play, he may win the MVP.</p>\n<p>The Unpredictability Continues</p>\n<p>The New York Giants entered Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys with a 6-2 record. They possessed the NFC’s top-ranked offense and defense and were riding a five-game winning streak (including a win over Dallas). The Cowboys were 1-7 and seemingly in turmoil, yet dominated the Giants from the onset of the game to win 33-20 in Head Coach Jason Garrett.</p>\n<p>The previously 2-6 Denver Broncos beat the Kansas City Chiefs handily on Sunday, a team that was 5-3 and boasted the league’s top rushing offense.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Denver’s early domination (they were up 21-0 in the first quarter), Chiefs QB Matt Cassel ended up with a monster fantasy day, passing for 469 yards and four touchdowns. Two touchdowns and 186 yards of which belonged to WR Dwayne Bowe, including a beautifully wrapped gift (for which this fantasy owner is extremely grateful for) in the form of a garbage TD with 10 seconds left with KC down by 26.</p>\n<p>Attempting to figure the league out this year is tough, but here are my top five teams right now:</p>\n<p>1.) Patriots (7-2): They just beat down the Steelers and showed why coaching is so important in the NFL — Belichick never loses two in a row.</p>\n<p>2.) Falcons (7-2): I believe in Matt Ryan. And Roddy White. For fantasy purposes, too.</p>\n<p>3.) Saints (6-3): They get Reggie Bush back, and aren’t they still the defending champs?</p>\n<p>5.) Eagles (6-3): With a larger sample size with Vick as quarterback, they could be even higher.</p>\n<p>4.) Jets (7-2): They are 7-2, and although he is inconsistent, Mark Sanchez finds a way to win close games (two in a row on the road in OT).</p>\n<p>Now, in the words of Jim Rome: I am out!</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush will be representing Daily Nexus Sports at the ESPYs in the category of best Jim Rome impression.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29950\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29950\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/","id":2896,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2895,2894,2893],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: Back in Black (and Silver)","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The entire time I was writing this column, a little voice in my head was saying, “The Raiders?

It seems the only explanation for Oakland’s success is that Al Davis — who eerily resembles a cross between an orc from “Lord of the Rings” and some sort of sea monster from “Pirates of the Caribbean” — is, in fact, dead. The franchise is finally able to function normally without him.</p>\n<p>On a serious note, Davis has made some great personnel decisions as of late, including the acquisition of Campbell and deciding to keep Head Coach Tom Cable while relieving him from play-calling duties. First-year offensive coordinator Hue Jackson has taken over this role, and the normally stagnant and even laughable offense has seen a major boost. Just halfway through the season, the Raiders’ offense is well on pace to pass their offensive production from all of last year in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>It seems a stable quarterback and a little bit of continuity in the coaching staff can go a long way. Take notes, 49ers.</p>\n<p>The star of the silver and black has been third-year running back Darren McFadden. If you haven’t seen him play, the dude is amazing and is finally living up to the hype that surrounded him when he left Arkansas. It seems the talent is back, and after two frustrating, injury-plagued seasons (believe me, I would know after owning McFadden in fantasy leagues the past two years) he has finally put it all together.</p>\n<p>In addition to boasting some of the best stats in the NFL so far this season, McFadden also boasts one of the bests nicknames in the league: RUN DMC (Get it? He runs. His first name starts with a D. And his last name has the MC… there goes the light bulb for some of you slower ones).</p>\n<p>Halfway through the season, the Raiders are currently second in the NFL in rushing, while DMC leads the league in yards per game with 108.1 and in yards after contact with 358  (more than his entire rushing yards total from last season), is fourth in rushing yards at 757 and third in yards per carry at 5.4.</p>\n<p>The Raiders have also fought to overcome adversity. The team started off 1-3 before turning their season around and going 4-1. After beating the Chiefs on Sunday, Oakland sits only a half game out of first place in the AFC West.</p>\n<p>The team has shifted its philosophy as of late, actually making strategic moves instead of the usual Oakland head-scratchers. Refraining from getting greedy in recent offseason free agency markets, building a good team through the draft and strategic acquisition such as Campbell and veteran defensive end Richard Seymour have paid dividends for the Raiders.</p>\n<p>Seymour has been an unbelievable pickup. Earlier this season, it looked like the Patriots’ front office had done it again, when the Raiders seemed destined for a top five pick — a pick that they traded to New England for Seymour. However, that pick is not looking to be as valuable as previously thought. Meanwhile, Seymour has provided leadership and excellent play on the field. The defensive line has been the strength of the Raiders’ defense, which is seventh in overall defense and third in passing defense. Seymour — who has 4.5 sacks and 4 tackles for loss on the year — constantly demands double-teams, which frees up other players.</p>\n<p>The bye week actually may be coming at the wrong time for the Raiders, who are riding their first three-game winning streak since their 2002 Super Bowl season. I say the Raiders are for real. Although we shouldn’t get too ahead of ourselves due to their recent success, the silver and black seem destined to challenge the Chiefs and the Chargers (who will make their usual late-season run) for an AFC West division title.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush sells purple drank by the barrel, and at a very reasonable cost.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/","id":2895,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2894,2893,2892],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: How to See the Future","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There is always one.

One donut left in the box, one cookie left on the plate and one player each week who attempts to screw up what would otherwise have been a great fantasy day.</p>\n<p>This wouldn’t be a big deal if it were possible to predict who the guilty player would be on a given week, but when you have a team full of players who are for the most part productive week in and week out, predicting a fantasy disaster can be difficult.</p>\n<p>For my team, this week’s offender was Chad Henne, quarterback on the Miami Dolphins. Henne has not been the best quarterback this season, but he has been solid. He has four double digit fantasy days in eight games and, before last Sunday, had an 8-7 touchdown to interception ratio, which is decent for a quarterback in his first season as the starter.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In any case, while he has thrown his share of interceptions, he had, up until Sunday, always been able to make up for it with a good amount of passing yards and a couple of touchdowns. So with Donovan McNabb, my usual starter, on a bye week, I did not hesitate to start Henne when he went up against a Ravens defense that was not what it used to be. I should have hesitated.</p>\n<p>Henne rewarded my confidence with his worst day as a starting quarterback. He threw for just 231 yards and zero touchdowns, and complemented that with three interceptions and two fumbles for a grand total of four fantasy points. Luckily for me, the team I was facing did so badly that I didn’t need Henne in order to win, but I know I won’t always be so lucky.</p>\n<p>Henne is not the first player to let me down, and he won’t be the last. Week 1 it was Calvin Johnson. Week 2 it was Hines Ward.  Week 7 it was Larry Fitzgerald. And next week? It could be anyone. All I know for certain is that someone will attempt to sabotage my fantasy day and there is nothing I can do to stop them.</p>\n<p>Read into matchups to root out problems and set the best possible lineup each week. It is only because I had players like Aaron Hernandez and Sebastian Janikowski in my lineup that I managed to scrape out a win, and it is only because I knew how poorly the Cleveland Browns were doing against tight ends that I knew to start Hernandez.</p>\n<p>The fact is, you can’t predict letdowns. Even if a player has what seems to be a favorable matchup, they can still have off days for an unforeseeable reason such as injury or because that player’s team is just having a collective off day.</p>\n<p>All you can really do is attempt to set the strongest lineup possible week in and week out based on matchups and predictions, neither of which really mean anything, which basically means there is no real way to know if you are completely screwed or not. Having good players helps, but even they have off days. And on that note, I say to you good luck and may the force be with you. Trust me, you’re going to need it.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg never, ever leaves one cookie on the plate.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/","id":2894,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2893,2892,2891],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":20,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
