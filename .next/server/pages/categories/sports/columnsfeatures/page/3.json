It will become a full member in 2024.</p>\n<p>Many have speculated the difference this time around was CSUB’s invitation to join the conference, which allowed for an equal amount of UCs and CSUs in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>The commissioner shot that notion down saying the balance of the schools was not as important as the prestige of the schools.</p>\n<p>For Cal State Bakersfield, this move was by far a no-brainer. Currently, apart of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), CSUB has to travel a lot to face their conference opponents such as schools like New Mexico State, Seattle University, Chicago State, Utah Valley and more that were just out of their way.</p>\n<p>Nine of the teams in the Big West Conference are all in the same state, California, which will help them save money on travel costs.</p>\n<p>Since it is already a D-I program, CSUB will become an official Big West member in all sports in 2020.</p>\n<p>UCSD and CSUB will probably find a very happy life in the Big West just as UC Davis did when it joined back in 2003.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79939\" style=\"width: 291px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1821621230\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79937\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79939\" data-attachment-id=\"79939\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/how-do-the-latest-big-west-changes-impact-ucsb/bigwestmap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=600%2C1700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,1700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bigwestmap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=88%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=361%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79939\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap-361x1024.png?resize=281%2C797\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?resize=361%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 361w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?resize=88%2C250&amp;ssl=1 88w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79939\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, the bigger question is how will this affect UCSB and the sports programs found here on campus?</p>\n<p>The short answer: This is not a move that will help UCSB in any way.</p>\n<p>While the two schools might be able to help the Gauchos in smaller sports such as men’s water polo or men’s volleyball, they won’t be a big boost to the sports most fans and alums care about: soccer, baseball and basketball.</p>\n<p>CSUB has been improving in men’s basketball, winning the WAC title the last two seasons and making a decent run in the NIT last year, but it’s not a school that the Gauchos will benefit from having on their schedule — not yet.</p>\n<p>If they continue the trend, then maybe down the line this could become a great game that will draw many fans, but as of right now, I doubt UCSB students will be geared up to go to a CSUB game.</p>\n<p>Again, CSUB is not a bad addition that will hurt UCSB due to its winning ways the past few years, but its jump to the Big West will also show if those winning seasons were due to them being in a less competitive conference or not.</p>\n<p>As for UCSD, they will be an RPI anchor for years until they can get their program up to D-I competitiveness. While not being an anchor for the first years during their reclassification period, the Tritons will have a tough time before they get their program to a competitive level.</p>\n<p>For comparison reasons, UC Davis barely won their first Big West Tournament title this past season and while they are in the right direction, before last season they only had one winning campaign in their first 12 years of Division-I status.</p>\n<p>These two additions will also not move the conference up the RPI ladder as a whole either.</p>\n<p>In baseball, the Gauchos are already in a peculiar position in that if they don’t win their conference, then their road to a postseason regional match is already up in the air.</p>\n<p>It comes down to who they schedule and beat in non-conference play because, as it stands, the Big West conference is not seen as deserving of more than one team sent to the postseason.</p>\n<p>It has routinely sent more than one team in the past, but it has not always been easy and in fact, the Gauchos missed the postseason in despite going 34-17-1 because their RPI was not up to snuff.</p>\n<p>Again, CSUB does not help this problem. It also doesn’t help that last year’s conference RPI has the Big West in eighth while the WAC was in 25.</p>\n<p>UCSD has been a big factor in D-II college baseball, but a move to D-I will be a difficult one, and while some teams have managed to build a contender in a short amount of time, it will still be a tough road for the Tritons.</p>\n<p>The same problem goes for other big sports such as soccer.</p>\n<p>The problem with adding CSUB isn’t that you are adding a program that is horrible across the sports landscape, it’s that you’re adding another average team to a conference that could use a big name to help propel its status.</p>\n<p>As it stands right now, the addition of these two teams doesn’t help UCSB. But, if down the line CSUB is able to continue their success in sports such as basketball, baseball, etc. and help renovate some of their stadiums, which it hopes to do with the money it saves, then maybe they could help get some more exposure for a conference primarily now made up of California teams.</p>\n<p>The same goes for UCSD once they become a full-fledged member.</p>\n<p>The bottom line for UCSB, however, is simple: it has to capitalize on this conference and start becoming the team that dominates it, especially in these bigger sports. For most successful mid-majors like Gonzaga in men’s basketball, they aren’t in tough conferences either, however, it’s the way they dominate their conference that gives them notoriety.</p>\n<p>The Big West, even with these two additions, is still a conference that can provide some quality teams. But if UCSB can become the team that dominates in year in and year out, then it won’t matter who is and who is not added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 30</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

But as any hardcore Eagles fan will tell you, don’t say Super Bowl just yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Injuries, and Lots of Them</strong></p>\n<p>Many factors come into play when analyzing the current success of this Eagles squad. However, a good place to start would be the team’s ability to overcome several injuries to very key positions.</p>\n<p>In Week 1, star cornerback Ronald Darby, former PFF Rookie Defensive Player of the Year, went down with a dislocated right ankle injury, sidelining him all season thus far.</p>\n<p>Two games later, running back Darren Sproles tore his ACL and broke his arm, eliminating perhaps the Eagles’ best playmaker at the time. Week 7 signaled the season-ending loses of two pivotal players as future Hall of Famer left tackle Jason Peters was carted off and middle linebacker sensation Jordan Hicks was locker room-bound.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the countless roadblocks that Philadelphia has had to deal with. Yet, considering they’ve made it this far and have still managed a best in the league performance week in and week out, the Eagles are really promoting a “next one up” mentality throughout their roster of players.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Darby and second-round draft pick Sidney Jones IV are due back any time now, meaning that the Eagles defensive productivity will soon match their offensive output. So word to the wise, no longer should only the NFC East be afraid, but the entire NFL should be as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Next-One-Up </strong></p>\n<p>This phrased mindset refers to how well a team’s substitutes and second-string players can acclimate and produce when called upon following injuries to starters. More specifically, how well Philadelphia’s depth chart has adjusted to such mishaps has been a dimension of its momentum.</p>\n<p>Starting with the cornerbacks, former seventh-round pick Jalen Mills has played solidly through his sophomore year with three interceptions and one “pick-six” touchdown return. Veteran corner Patrick Robinson was brought in to help as a rotational player, yet he is now graded as the No. 3 CB with a PFF defensive grade of 91.2.</p>\n<p>As for the receiving corps, Nelson Agholor has done a complete 180 in terms of his poor performance last year. With 428 yards and five touchdowns through nine games, Agholor can definitely be considered a candidate for the NFL’s Most Improved award. Meanwhile, fourth-string wide receiver Mack Hollins has shown some flashy playmaking ability while only being a fourth-round steal of a rookie.</p>\n<p>Concerning the team’s run game, this is where the Eagles have most notably gone off, even with Sproles’s absence.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the many talents of LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and Wendell Smallwood, the Eagles are fourth in the NFL in rushing yards per game with a 136.8 average. Oh, and they recently traded for pro-bowl running back Jay Ajayi.</p>\n<p>Altogether, this is a team that wants to win, and their coaching staff will do their best to appropriately rotate everyone into the play scheme.</p>\n<p><strong>The Art of the Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s back track a little bit and comprehend just how much of a robbery it was when the Eagles traded one of their three fourth-round picks to the Miami Dolphins for Ajayi. With a year of NFL play under his belt, Ajayi exploded onto the NFL scene last season.</p>\n<p>Ajayi has already been to the Pro Bowl and was considered as high as a top-five running back talent entering the 2017-18 season. So one must begin to question how on Earth a player of Ajayi’s caliber, who averaged 4.9 yards per carry last year, managed to be practically gifted to the Eagles.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the answer is Howie Roseman, who is the executive vice president of Philadelphia’s football operations.</p>\n<p>Roseman has pretty much been the brains behind most of the great Eagles’ trades since this past offseason. With him bringing in names such as Alshon Jeffery, LeGarrette Blount, Timmy Jernigan and Ronald Darby, it’s clear to see that the office personnel has placed the team in a position to succeed with their key decision-making.</p>\n<p>In turn, Head Coach Doug Pederson and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz have done their best to play these free agents and new players.</p>\n<p>Altogether, it’s paid off thus far.

It was a challenge that he embraced.</p>\n<p>His offensive prowess is not to be overlooked as he led the Celtics to the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference just last season. Not one soul in Boston could forget the tragic night Thomas’ sister passed away in a fatal car crash.</p>\n<p>Just days after, Thomas played in Game 2 of the team’s Eastern Conference Semifinal matchup versus the Washington Wizards, on the day that would have been his sister’s 23rd birthday. Thomas went off for 53 points in what was a thriller of a 129-119 OT win for the Celtics.</p>\n<p>So, with all of his undeniable guts and glory, why would Boston feel the need to trade Thomas?</p>\n<p>The answer is simple: Boston business.</p>\n<p>This concept of doing what it takes to win is nothing new for Boston, as it is the most storied sports city in the nation.</p>\n<p>Irving is an offensive powerhouse with more length and the gift of time on his side. Younger, faster and NBA Finals experienced, it is clear that Irving is a much better player than Thomas.<br>\nIrving is a commanding player who could lead the Celtics and possibly give them the edge versus a Cleveland team who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the last season’s NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Fans say it’s wrong and broadcasters ask, “Where’s the loyalty?”</p>\n<p>But has it been forgotten that just a few years back, when New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe went down against the New York Jets in 2001, a young Tom Brady took the starting quarterback position out from under him because of his superior play? In 2013, the Boston Bruins traded away a young Tyler Seguin, who was said to be the future of the team, for reasons never disclosed but was undoubtedly a move to make the team better.</p>\n<p>Loyalty is not a plausible factor in the sports world, at least not when it comes to Boston.</p>\n<p>Boston will do what it takes to win because that is the culture of the winningest city in the nation.</p>\n<p>Boston knows nothing other than winning, and this is nothing new. It’s easy to question the aspect of loyalty when you are faced with the unknown.</p>\n<p>When Brady took over for Bledsoe in 2001, nobody knew that he would later be considered the greatest of all time.</p>\n<p>There were still some who wanted Bledsoe back in his starting role when he came back healthy. Instead, once Head Coach Bill Belichick committed to Brady as his starter, he did what some thought to be a vicious move — he traded Bledsoe and did so within his own AFC East division to the Buffalo Bills.</p>\n<p>This move wasn’t made out of malicious intent; rather, it was made to make the Patriots team even better as they acquired the Bills’ first round pick in 2003 in exchange for Bledsoe.</p>\n<p>It was obviously the right move to start Brady because the Patriots have since gone on to win the Super Bowl in 2002, 2004, 2005 and most recently in 2015 and 2017.</p>\n<p>The same can be said with the Celtics. Though the trade of Thomas looms over as a cloud of uncertainty, in addition to having to deal with the loss of Gordon Hayward for the season, the fact remains that Danny Ainge and the front office believe the Thomas-Irving move will make the team better.</p>\n<p>Boston is a city of champions, and no sense of loyalty to a player will keep that mentality alive, but keeping the business-savvy outlook of winning will. Being willing to do whatever it takes to keep the team successful, no matter how controversial, is one of the many qualities that separates Boston from the rest.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 26, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/","id":1877,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[1876,1875,1874],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blast From the Past: Rookie Flashbacks of Today’s NBA Stars","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbablogbig.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbablogbig.jpg?resize=980%2C623&ssl=1","description":"The 2017-18 NBA season is among us.

The initial thought was to join the wave of “bold predictions” concerning who would be this year’s NBA champion, MVP, scoring champion, Rookie of the Year, etc.<br>\nBut then it hit me.<br>\n“How did today’s NBA stars fare in each of their debuts?”<br>\nThe talent of current NBA rookies Lonzo Ball, Markelle Fultz, Jayson Tatum, De’Aaron Fox, Ben Simmons and others has brought about one of the most hyped draft classes in years, possibly since the 2003 NBA Draft. Now, it’s time to explore the journeys of players who were once in their shoes and are now at the top of the game.<br>\nIn honor of the return of NBA basketball, here is a list of today’s biggest names and how they did in their introductions to the league.</p>\n<p><strong>LeBron James: Oct. 29, 2003 – Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Sacramento Kings</strong><br>\nIt was during LeBron James’s senior year of high school at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s that he tattooed “Chosen 1” on his upper back after being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Getting such ink is likely something many would deem as risky, but “King James” has lived up to the moniker as one of the best ever, as he just began his 15th NBA season.<br>\nStill, to this day, we have yet to see any other high school player with the buzz LeBron had leading up to his NBA arrival.<br>\nLeBron didn’t disappoint in his first NBA game, finishing with a stat line of 25 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in 42 minutes of play, but was defeated 106-92.<br>\nThe chase for ring No. 4 has begun. With no Kyrie Irving and the additions of Dwyane Wade, Isaiah Thomas, Derrick Rose and others, another tough journey lies ahead for King James and the Cavs, as it’s logical to assume that they have one thing on their minds: to find a way to defeat the Golden State Warriors.</p>\n<p><strong>Steph Curry: Oct. 28, 2009 – GS Warriors vs. Houston Rockets</strong><br>\nAt the core of the Warriors’ dethronement of the King and co. in two of the last three NBA Finals series is Stephen Curry. It’s no question that Curry is the greatest shooter of all time. From breaking the NBA’s single-game record of three-pointers made with 13 last season to surpassing the NBA’s single-season record for three-pointers made a total of three times, in addition to becoming the only player to ever make 300 and 400-plus threes in a season, Curry’s numbers need no explanation.<br>\nKnown for his sharpshooter ability at Davidson College, Curry’s first NBA game was a convincing performance. It was an efficient game by Curry, as he went 7-of-12 from the field to score 14 points, dished out seven assists and snagged four steals in a narrow 108-107 loss. Most surprisingly, he went 0-1 from beyond the arc. Aren’t we grateful that the world of analytics wasn’t as prevalent then as it is today? Boy, would they have been proven wrong.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo: Oct. 30, 2013 – Milwaukee Bucks vs. NY Knicks</strong><br>\nThe youngest player of the 2013 NBA Draft, the then 18-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo was a mystery for most coming out of the Greek professional basketball club Filathlitikos.<br>\nHis body and build showed signs of a stretch forward who had the length yet lacked the bulk. Uncertainty loomed even more after Antetokounmpo played just 4:43 minutes and scored one point from the free-throw line with no shot attempts in his NBA debut, which concluded with a 90-83 defeat.<br>\nBut that performance wasn’t the end of the tale for Antetokounmpo.<br>\nIt was the start of a star whom we all know as “The Greek Freak.”<br>\n“The Greek Freak, I think, is a force. I’ve never seen anything like him. His ceiling is probably … he could end up being the best player to ever play if he really wanted to. That’s pretty scary to think about. He’s by far my most favorite player to watch.”<br>\nThose are the words of Golden State’s Kevin Durant, who made such claims in a video on his YouTube channel.<br>\nThey’re words that were earned, as Antetokounmpo is coming off his best career year after becoming a first-time NBA All-Star and the first player ever to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all major stats (points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks).<br>\nKD is right; Antetokounmpo’s ceiling has no limits at the ripe, pre-prime age of 22. Who knows, the Greek Freak just might fulfill Kobe Bryant’s challenge of winning the NBA MVP award.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Durant: Oct. 31, 2007 – Seattle Supersonics vs. Denver Nuggets</strong><br>\nThe first glimpse into the current wave of stretch forwards begins with Kevin Durant. While the impact of length had been witnessed with legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain, and the ability to handle the ball with craft was displayed by players such Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Allen Iverson, Durant introduced an unorthodox skillset — a near seven-foot stature with the ability to do it all on the court.<br>\nRight out the gates in his first career game, the then 19-year-old was looking to make an immediate impact as he ended with 22 shot attempts. He finished with 18 points with seven made field goals, five rebounds, three steals and a block in a 120-103 loss to a Denver team that had both Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson record a combined 57 points.<br>\nThe current state of KD’s career is at its full peak after his decision to join the Golden State Warriors last offseason. Despite the critics, Durant is now an NBA champion and NBA Finals MVP and has convinced many that he is the league’s best player.</p>\n<p><strong>James Harden: Oct. 28, 2009 – OKC Thunder vs. Sacramento Kings</strong><br>\nWhether it be from long range or a quick hesi-eurostep, Harden is one the NBA’s most lethal offensive players.<br>\nUpon entering the league, he was drafted into one of the best situations possible with his teammates being Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.<br>\nHow Harden would fit within that puzzle was a concern.<br>\nBefore becoming the star player we know today as “The Beard,” his growth began with his transition to the pros.<br>\nIt was a slow start for Harden, whose playing time was capped at 13 minutes and included five points on 2-of-2 shooting, 1-of-1 from behind the three-point line and two rebounds in a 102-89 win.<br>\nSince joining the Houston Rockets, Harden has become one of the NBA’s ultimate stars and is coming off a year during which he averaged 29.1 points, 11.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds per game — all career highs.<br>\nClaims that Harden has been snubbed twice for the NBA MVP award still ring, but after helping lead the Rockets to their 122-121 win over the Warriors, he and Houston could possibly be a true contender in the West.</p>\n<p><strong>Kawhi Leonard: Dec. 26, 2011 – SA Spurs vs. Memphis Grizzlies</strong><br>\nThe late start was a result of the 2011 NBA lockout that took place. Most notably, the Indiana Pacers must regret trading Kawhi Leonard to the Spurs.<br>\nOverlooked in his draft class due to questions surrounding his offensive potential, Leonard turned out to be the biggest steal of the draft and is now within the conversation of being the game’s next best player.<br>\nSimilar to some others on this list, his first game didn’t make a profound statement.<br>\nComing off the bench in the Spurs’ 95-82 defeat of Memphis, Leonard concluded his debut with six points on 2-of-9 shooting along with six rebounds, two steals and an assist.<br>\nA reserved, humble spirit who lets his play do all the talking, Leonard remained low on many fans’ and experts’ radars until his emergence in the 2014 NBA Finals. He ended the championship series averaging 17.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game to win the NBA Finals MVP award.<br>\nHis postseason performance was the birth of a star, as he went on to embrace a bigger role for the Spurs and is now the team’s No. 1 option after putting up a career-high scoring average of 25.5 PPG last season.<br>\nIn spite of being ruled out of the Spurs’ Wednesday season opener, “The Klaw” seems to be on a path to greatness as he prepares for another year as San Antonio’s leading man.</p>\n<p><strong>Russell Westbrook: Oct. 29, 2008 – OKC Thunder vs. Milwaukee Bucks</strong><br>\nSince day one, Westbrook has been known for his relentless, Looney Tunes “Tasmanian Devil” motor. His first full season without KD left many favoring the likelihood of the Thunder plummeting to the bottom half of the Western Conference.<br>\nRather than sink, Westbrook made history and won the NBA MVP award after breaking NBA legend Oscar Robertson’s single-season triple double-record of 41 by finishing last season with 42 and becoming the first player since Robertson to average a triple-double (31.6 PPG, 10.4 APG, 10.7 RPG).<br>\nRewinding back to the first game of his rookie year, he had 13 points, four assists, four rebounds and one block in a 98-87 loss.<br>\nWestbrook can produce for a team on his own, but he did need more help. That help has arrived with OKC’s additions of stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony.</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony Davis: Oct. 31, 2012 – New Orleans Hornets vs. SA Spurs</strong><br>\nThe process of being drafted by a rebuilding franchise has been a long, challenging journey for Anthony Davis, who has one playoff appearance under his belt.<br>\nHowever, “The Brow” has proven that he belongs in the NBA and showcased this in his career debut.<br>\nHe made the most of his 29 minutes, having tallied 21 points on a 6-of-12 shooting performance all while collecting seven rebounds, one steal and one block apiece, but the team still lost 99-95.</p>\n<p><strong>Damian Lillard: Oct. 31, 2012 – Portland Trailblazers vs. LA Lakers</strong><br>\nComing out of Weber State, Damian Lillard has and still does rock a chip on his shoulder as he embraces the underdog role of being underrated throughout his career.<br>\nHe and the Trailblazers hosted the Lakers, who at the time had Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash on their team.<br>\nDame showed no fear and managed to overcome six turnovers as he broke out for a night that consisted of scoring 23 points, 11 assists, three rebounds and one steal. His strong performance helped lead Portland to a 116-106 victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Kyrie Irving: Dec. 26, 2011 – Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Toronto Raptors</strong><br>\nFollowing “The Decision” of LeBron James to leave Cleveland for the Miami Heat, the Cavaliers were in search of their next superstar.<br>\nWith the No. 1 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, Kyrie Irving was the team’s selection to be the face of its franchise.<br>\nThe pressure may have gotten to Irving in his debut as he finished with six points on 2-of-12 shooting, seven assists, three rebounds and one steal in the Cavs’ 104-96 loss.<br>\nJames’s return in 2014 led to the pairing of him and Irving, which resulted in their success of winning one NBA title in three years of playing with each other prior to Irving having his trade request granted this past summer, landing him in Boston.<br>\nTuesday night was just the beginning of the “Uncle Drew-King James” saga that will continue to build hype as the season progresses.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Both Santa Barbara natives, the two Hauschild’s were used to playing with each other on the same teams in both the High School level at San Marcos and at the club level while also attending matches at UCSB’s Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The two brothers were introduced to the sport by their younger sister who had been playing since she was 10. She is now currently a freshman at USC and is a member of the Trojans’ women’s water polo team as a driver after graduating from San Marcos High.</p>\n<p>Once introduced, Shane and Ben loved the sport and before you knew it, the Hauschild family had another connection point: water polo.</p>\n<p>“We went to try it, immediately loved it and made it our top priority so it really united all of us because we all had our different paths but water polo connected us. It definitely been a huge positive,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>“She [the sister] definitely started the water polo trend in the family and then my parents caught on, became the biggest supporters and we all then grew to love the sport immensely uniting us even more,” Ben added.</p>\n<p>With Shane being a year older, he was the first of the two to get the opportunity to go to University and continue his water polo career. In that 2014 season, Shane won the MPSF Freshman of Year after a 32-goal season while Ben led his high school team to its first league title in 20 years.</p>\n<p>What Shane accomplished his freshman year was remarkable, however, just the fact he was able to continue his water polo career at a Division-I NCAA level was incredible on its own when you consider only 2.8 percent of US High School Water Polo Players compete at NCAA I schools.</p>\n<p>Now after looking at that, it’s even more incredible to consider that the younger Hauschild was also able to get his own Division-I opportunity, opting to go to San Jose State, a school that is new to the water polo scene.</p>\n<p>“I heard it’s going to grow quickly and I could’ve gone to a more established program and do something that’s already happened,” Ben said. “Or I had this unique opportunity to come to San Jose State and work with a program, build a program and be a big name on a growing program.”</p>\n<p>After the decision was made, an even more amazing coincidence happened. UCSB, along with a few other programs, seceded from the MPSF, their former conference, and established the GCC, a conference that added San Jose State along for the ride.</p>\n<p>The move, unknowingly, set the stage not just for this Friday’s match, but last years match.</p>\n<p>Nearly one year ago to the day, the two brothers faced off for the first time ever at Campus Pool and to this day remember the feelings of that night.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous because quite honestly I didn’t know what to expect, I never had to guard him before that,” Shane said. “I didn’t know how physical it would get and I didn’t know how to go about it at all but it all went well in the end.”</p>\n<p>“It was the most anticipated match for me all season long,” Ben said. “I definitely tried to take it to another level. I didn’t want to get bested by him so there was definitely some extra adrenaline playing each other.”</p>\n<p>Not just happy that they got to play each other, Ben and Shane were also excited to be able to play in Santa Barbara, the place they grew up and the place that held all their friends and family.</p>\n<p>After the match, UCSB, a heavy favorite, came out the victor 13-7 to no one’s shock, but the brothers never shared a moment of displeasure with each other.</p>\n<p>“Even though we are supposed to be rivals I know he is still my brother. It’s more of a fun rivalry as compared to an actual competitive rivalry. We both want the best for each other,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Even though Ben and his team came out the loser, he was never unappreciative of the fact he got to go toe-to-toe with his big brother.</p>\n<p>“I feel gratitude playing against him. I don’t feel the need to outperform him, I don’t want him to play bad or anything like that,” Ben said. “I am just trying to put on a good show and performance for my team and I know he’s going to do the same.”</p>\n<p>Like brother, like brother both Shane and Ben say playing in that Oct. 14 conference game last year at Campus Pool has been the favorite moment of their collegiate careers with both even pointing to the end of the match specifically.</p>\n<p>“Best moment was by far end of the game last year at UCSB,” Ben said. “Knowing I did my absolute best and kind of my coming out party because since then I have played my game but just playing in front of that crowd, in that pool and playing in a place I saw games at growing up was amazing.”</p>\n<p>“My favorite moment was after the game last year because we just gave each other a big hug after the match and just talked,” Shane said. “Everyone of our friends and family came up super stoked and we all reflected on the game and it was super cool.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Friday’s match, which could be the last time the two ever play each other again with Shane being a senior unless they meet at the conference tournament, both brothers are looking for the win, but even more than that, both are looking to cherish what could be the end of a fun era.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want to make the most of this game,” Ben said. “With this being the last time we could play each other I am going to go all out, hope for a good result and I think it will be a good game between us.”</p>\n<p>“This could be the last time I play him and this could be the last year I even play water polo in general so I just want to have fun and cherish being at that moment playing with and against my brother,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ben is not particularly shy about making his goal known of hopefully being able to pull off the upset this Friday. In fact, it would be his version of a perfect ending to this brotherly trilogy.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would definitely be beating UCSB which had been a huge motivation for me since coming here, I couldn’t ask for anything more than to score an upset over UCSB while he [Shane] is still around,” Ben said.</p>\n<p>Getting more specific, Ben added he would like a “close one-goal game in overtime with SJSU coming out the victor with me scoring the final goal over my brother and against one of my closest friends [Justyn Barrios, UCSB’s goalkeeper] to seal the win.”</p>\n<p>On the other side, Shane has never been one to tease his brother over the fact his team has gotten the better of him twice in this rivalry but he also recognizes, winning is better than losing.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to lie, I would be upset if we lost,” Shane laughed. “Not at him obviously but more so at myself and our team. He would probably rub it in to make me mad but it would also be a good memory. I would definitely want to get my revenge at that tournament at that point.”</p>\n<p>With that, Shane’s perfect ending to this trifecta would be as follows.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would be us coming out with a win but my brother comes out happy after a great game, then after the game, we hug it out, go get dinner with our parents and be happy.”</p>\n<p>No matter the outcome, no matter the whose version of a perfect ending comes true, no matter anything, the two brothers have made it clear that this game means more than just the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>The two have been connected for a long time thanks to water polo, and it’s because of water polo that they get this special platform to go head-to-head one more time.</p>\n<p>Cherishing the moment is more important for them than ever holding ill-will toward one another for something as simple as winning and losing.</p>\n<p>Because as far as this writer is concerned, both Ben and Shane Hauschild have already won at something much more important: happiness. A word that perfectly encapsulates the feelings this two share when they are in the pool whether it be with each other or against one another.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>But this time around the experience is different. While no executive order has been implemented, the same oppressive nature is being reproduced by Trump’s attempt to silence the voices of NFL players who are currently protesting social injustice, racial inequality and Trump’s objective to have them taken off the field for protesting as his tweets suggest.</p>\n<p>The recent NFL events that have taken place this week display an attempt to force “athletes to stick to sports.”</p>\n<p>Supporting such a message have been the actions of the world’s 12th and 19th richest sports team owners: Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and the leader of ‘America’s Team,’ the Dallas Cowboys, owner Jerry Jones.</p>\n<p>Prior to the kickoff of the Dolphins’ Week Five matchup vs the Tennessee Titans, Ross spoke about his stance on player protest and the impact he believes Trump has had, claiming that the President has “changed that whole paradigm of what protest is. And I think it’s incumbent upon the players today, because of how the public is looking at it, to really stand and really salute the flag,” per the <em>SunSentiel’s </em>Chris Perkins.</p>\n<p>Jones spoke with no filter, expressing his expectations that, “If there is anything disrespecting the flag, then we will not play. Period. We’re going to respect the flag and I’m going to create the perception of it,” according to Brandon George of the <em>Dallas Morning News, </em>via <em>CBSsports’ </em>Sean Wagner-McGough. The Cowboys owner said such remarks after kneeling with his team in unison the previous week prior to the national anthem being sang, then locked arms with players as they all stood during its performance.</p>\n<p>The sudden change of heart occurs after Jones admitted to having a recent phone call with Trump, claiming that the President was the one to remind him of the league’s Game Operations Manual policy. A policy that doesn’t require but rather suggests that players should stand for the anthem. Jones is also one of eight known owners that donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Per Kurt Badenhausen, “Nineteen NFL teams are owned by billionaires, led by [Paul] Allen, Shahid Khan ($8.2 billion) of the Jacksonville Jaguars and [Stanley] Kroenke, who also owns the recently relocated Los Angeles Rams. The explosion in NFL values has produced more billionaires than any other league with eight people in the 10-figure net worth club as result of the value of their NFL franchises” (<em>Forbes, </em>March 20, 2017).</p>\n<p>Why state such statistics that seem to have no relevance regarding what either of the aforementioned owners said?</p>\n<p>Because it’s time to flip the narrative, just like they and Trump have.</p>\n<p>For those individuals opposed to NFL players protesting because of their millionaire status, why aren’t team owners with billions of dollars being chastised for “not sticking to sports” as well?</p>\n<p>Critics of the protests have yet to realize that a majority of these owners actually care about avoiding controversy more than respecting the flag in order to sustain one thing: monetary revenue.</p>\n<p>A happy consumer equals more money. Not to mention, a happy sponsor equals more money.</p>\n<p>Jones’ statement included a term that is the tell all of what trying to dissuade players from protesting is really about – “perception.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, an array of individuals, media outlets and fans have fallen victim to the misconception of NFL players protesting the flag.</p>\n<p>Constructing such a misinterpretation has been White America’s ability to manipulate the media.</p>\n<p>Take Vice President Mike Pence, for example, and his latest publicity stunt in which he shortly attended the Indianapolis Colts-San Francisco 49ers game only to depart following the choice of about 20 San Francisco players to kneel during the performance of the national anthem.</p>\n<p>Tweeting his way to glory was Trump, who claims he asked Pence to leave the game if any players kneeled. Pence listened. He also tweeted about his exit.</p>\n<p>His decision to leave will continue to be perceived as staged due to the fact that anyone attending or watching the game knew that player protests were going to take place, and rightfully so.</p>\n<p>Since day one, the primary issue at hand is white supremacists believing they have the right to dictate how black people and other people of color should feel in response to the oppression they endure.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe it? Mike Ditka’s words prove it as he now tries to apologize for claiming that “there has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of.”</p>\n<p>A usual belief of those who feel the flag is being disrespected is that the select players choosing to protest are not appreciating its history and the lives of those who have sacrificed for our country.</p>\n<p>It is a false notion which was never these players purpose as individuals of all skin colors have expressed themselves and protested against inequality.</p>\n<p>Imagine how it feels for someone to just ignore the history, both before and after, of an era such as the Civil Rights Movement with a claim like Ditka did.</p>\n<p>This isn’t anything new, though. It dates back to slavery. But speaking to the sports activism currently taking place, beginning with Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest racial and social injustice and going to the present moment with voices like Jemele Hill and NFL players that have spoken up: shutting them out? It’s blatantly wrong.</p>\n<p>With no backbone to support such wrongdoing, as Goodell has come out and denounced the player protest while also announcing that he will meet with the league’s owners next week, overcoming being silenced by executive power both internally and externally is becoming an even more challenging feat.</p>\n<p>“The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” Goodell said on Tuesday in his call for protests to end.</p>\n<p>The cycle is full circle as both America and the NFL attempt to ignore the realities of social and racial inequality – the real threats that are dividing our nation.</p>\n<p>Presently, much uncertainty revolves around whether or not players will continue to protests, especially for those in Dallas facing the ultimatum of being benched.</p>\n<p>As the powerful words of Assata Shakur say, “We have nothing to lose but our chains.”</p>\n<p>Inequality has been one of the most oppressive “executive powers.” While always prevalent, conversation of its reality continues to reach its peak within sports. Something that was needed.</p>\n<p>Today, the fight for equality continues.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79086\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79086\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/","id":1873,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1872,1871,1870],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Sports and Politics Must Mix: Introducing Uncomfortability","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kaepernick-art-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kaepernick-art-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Daily Nexus sports writer Omar Hernandez explores the reality of the sports and political world and analyzes the viewpoints that have hurt and helped those discussions.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Almost exactly one year ago, Colin Kaepernick made the decision to sit during the national anthem at a 49ers pre-season game. Although portrayed as a rash, attention-seeking maneuver by much of the press, the truth is actually quite the opposite. Kaepernick had been auditing classes at CAL with the guidance of doctoral candidate Ameer Hasan Loggins and reading up on the teachings of Frantz Fanon and Patricia Hill for months before the protest. Yet he was still depicted as ignorant by some and as cluelessly abrasive by many.</p>\n<p>The protest lit up the media headlines like wildfire. Here was a young black athlete shunning one of the hallmarks of both American society and the sports world to call attention to the injustices that people of color continue to face in this country, which was not unprecedented considering the actions of a sports icon such as Muhammad Ali, who refused being inducted into the army in 1967 in defense of his civil rights. But it still felt shocking.</p>\n<p>The reactions to Kaepernick’s protest were varied, from claims that he was “disrespecting the flag” to the eventual dismissal of his message because he was not a starter on his team. However, one of the most popular oppositional viewpoints was that he, and athletes as a whole, should “just stick to sports.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Athletes such as Allen Iverson and Michael Jordan have established themselves in domains that are typically considered outside the boundaries of the playing field/court. Jordan created a streetwear empire and A.I. gave countless young black and brown kids the confidence and swagger to represent themselves and their cultures unabashedly.</p>\n<p>They were not exempt from the stigma or restrictions that usually accompany emphatic expressions of blackness; however, Iverson learned the hard way when his style of dress was used as the basis for a racially tinged dress code established by the NBA at the height of his career. The fact that athletes themselves have the unique power to capture the minds of such a large audience while operating in the institution of sports (that, just like any other large institution, is marred with the racism and discrimination of its society) is reflected in the rich history of activism as well as the dark past of discrimination that has been a part of all sports since their inception.</p>\n<p>The usage of sports as a conductor for social justice is not a new or novel concept, as exemplified from the gladiator uprisings of Ancient Rome to John Carlos and Tommie Smith raising their fists at the 1968 Summer Olympics. It is not too surprising that the “stick to sports” crowd is ignorant of just how antithetical that statement is to the core of what sports are or have been. However, it is not just ignorance that compels people to spout this backward thinking. There is a deep-seated sense of pain and discomfort for many white Americans in seeing this activism that is often not talked about but is rooted in the dehumanization of the black athlete.</p>\n<p>We all mythologize athletes. Sports fans often will often talk about how basketball or football is an escape for them, a game that takes them away from the harshness of the real world. Athletes are the vessels for our hopes, our dreams, even our insecurities.</p>\n<p>We rely on their labor for our entertainment; however, when their humanity interrupts or overshadows this very same entertainment, fans face a conundrum.</p>\n<p>We must strip athletes of most of their identity or personhood because if athletes are humanized, then the illusion is shattered. Many white fans don’t want to look at the face of their favorite athlete and see blackness. I don’t mean phenotypic brown and black skin but rather the deep-seated pain of a people who have been oppressed for centuries.</p>\n<p>Michael Jordan understood this very well. As the famous story goes, when asked why he didn’t speak up more for social causes, Jordan answered, “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” When Michael Bennett or Thabo Sefolosha speaks up against the police brutality they’ve encountered, or when Kaepernick elaborates on the school-to-prison pipeline, many sports fans are forced, for the first time, to truly look at these athletes as black and at just how much that affects their lives.</p>\n<p>These athletes can no longer be everyone’s vessel, because to be a vessel is to be empty, to be neutral, and in the face of institutionalized racism and violence, neutrality is impossible. It is hard for many white fans to understand this because it is not what they were taught. Sports is supposed to be a meritocracy, a great equalizer, but the truth is that meritocracy in our current state is just another facade.</p>\n<p>The institution of sports in which one group, white men, predominantly has ownership of another group, black men, can never be equal unless it’s changed, just as the institution of politics in which one group has historically made all the laws can never be equitable as well.</p>\n<p>It then makes sense why the rallying cry is not “racism doesn’t exist” but “stick to sports,” because to admit the reality, that these black athletes are intelligent, that they do have a strong pride in their identity and that the institution of sports is not exempt but rather perpetuates the very same racism that is rampant in this country, would then force fans to disrupt the status quo, to have to take action, and for too many white fans, being comfortable is more important than working toward justice.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the biggest reason that the reaction toward kneeling and activism in sports has been so visceral and negative is not Trump, it’s not the military and “patriotism,” and it’s certainly not that athletes aren’t able to articulate their positions effectively. The reason is that, just like any other time a racial injustice is brought to the forefront of the national conversation, it is making those who find comfort in white supremacy uncomfortable. What athletes and other political activists know, however, is that change only comes from discomfort, and if “mixing” sports and politics is what is causing this discomfort, then that means we are on the right track.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 28, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

I guess you can say I simply wrote from my heart because it’s just so saddening that a little over a year later, I find myself expressing similar sentiments to the Colin Kaepernick article I wrote. The former NFL quarterback’s initial call to action was his decision to sit on the bench during the National Anthem prior to electing to kneel in future games.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Kaepernick’s protest was to combat racial inequality and social injustice, as he stated, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, Sept. 22, at a rally for Alabama Republican Senate candidate Luther Strange, President Donald Trump suggested that NFL owners should demand to “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’’ in reference to players who have selected to kneel and protest during the anthem.</p>\n<p>As various players responded to his claims via social media, voicing their indifferences and unsurprised reactions, Trump followed up with a series of tweets days after the rally, generally stating that sports fans and this country will not condone players protesting the flag.</p>\n<p>As both a black man and a sports fan, Trump’s statements were no surprise to me as well.</p>\n<p>Although I am disappointed and sickened by such remarks, I feel like I’ve become numb to hearing such irrational and hate-filled words. It’s expected, especially when considering the fact that Trump and others who believe that players are disrespecting the flag do not see the bigger issue at hand.</p>\n<p>The larger issue at hand is that black people and people of color are not treated equally in this country. Nonetheless, this racial inequality isn’t being acknowledged but rather minimized by being framed as a threat to America and its flag.</p>\n<p>For people to mistake Kaepernick’s protest as being aimed at disrespecting the flag or military goes to show why movements such as Black Lives Matter are so relevant, especially as I witness people get more upset over athletes deciding to peacefully protest rather than the innocent lives that are taken on a yearly basis.</p>\n<p>It’s crazy to think how quick fans are to forgive and forget a player’s troubles with domestic violence, substance abuse violations or performance enhancement violations. While I do believe in second chances for certain circumstances, even for the aforementioned cases, to an extent, the fact that race is viewed as a topic that does not belong in connection to sports is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>It is time for us all to wake up!</p>\n<p>No, I do not have a specific solution to end racial inequality. But I do believe that the first step toward making progress begins with acknowledging and combating racism in order to overcome the taboo nature that has made it such a cringe-worthy topic.</p>\n<p>Doing so means that systemic ideologies such as colorblindness, in which we’ve been told that race and skin color don’t matter or that we live in a meritocratic society where everyone is on a level playing field and must put in the work to reach a certain level of so-called “success,” are things that must be stripped of their manipulative powers.</p>\n<p>Excuses that athletes need to “stick to sports” because of the amount of money they make and other claims that discredit today’s protests are just detractors from working towards unity.</p>\n<p>This is why I remain so proud of the NFL athletes who genuinely took a knee or protested in another manner this past Sunday. While I don’t believe that all players who demonstrated a protest were sincere, such actions were significant because, although immediate results will not show, an impact is still gradually being made.</p>\n<p>Whether it ever reaches him or not, I just want to say thank you to Colin Kaepernick for protesting and setting the precedent for what exists today in providing a voice for the voiceless concerning racial inequality. He wasn’t the first and he won’t be the last, but his impact is profound and will last forever.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, my mood is precisely expressed by Detroit Lions’ tight end Eric Ebron:</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_78874\" style=\"width: 619px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=78874\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-78874\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78874\" data-attachment-id=\"78874\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/screen-shot-2017-09-27-at-9-28-40-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=1288%2C618&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1288,618\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2017-09-27 at 9.28.40 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=888%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-78874\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM-1024x491.png?resize=609%2C292\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=1024%2C491&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=768%2C368&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?w=1288&amp;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tweet Courtesy of Eric Ebron, @Ebron85</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At first glance, Armani Smith, does not look like a freshman. In fact, he is already built like the big-league prospect that he is. Standing at 6’3” and weighing 195 pounds, the young utility baseball player from De La Salle High School was drafted in the 35th round by the Cleveland Indians before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>In his first year, Smith burst onto the scene for the Gauchos, hitting well for the majority of the season while playing solid defense in the field. At one point, the freshman was batting third with an average north of .350. Although Smith cooled down a bit, the young Gaucho star finished the season hitting .285 with three homeruns, 24 runs batted in and 32 runs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But those are just numbers. Smith’s play goes far deeper than what the numbers say. To simply put it, the kid does not get cheated at the plate. With every swing, even when fooled, Smith would let it fly. At times, Smith would swing <em>so</em> hard that even on misses the crowd would “Ooh” and “Ahh” in amazement. The three home runs hit by Smith were not your typical DI home runs, either. Smith would hit one out to deep right center, to deep center <em>on a line</em> and to left field that would clear not only the scoreboard but also the protective net that shields buildings near the stadium. That ball easily soared more than 400 feet, which is scary coming from a freshman. The kid has serious pop.</p>\n<p>What was even more impressive than his tools, though, was how selfless he was for his team. Smith would rover from right field, to left field to second base while moving around in the line-up all season long. Now, this may not sound like a big deal, but playing several positions while being moved around the line-up is one of the most uncomfortable things for a player to do, but Smith made it look easy. Without a doubt, for all his efforts, Armani Smith deserves to be the <em>Nexus</em> Sports Male Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsey Ruddins (W Volleyball) by Omar Hernandez</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78325\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78325\" data-attachment-id=\"78325\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lindsey Ruddins soars through the air while serving.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins had one of the most dominant individual seasons of any athlete at UCSB this year. The redshirt freshman from Laguna Niguel was a scourge on the offensive end, earning the Big West Freshman of the Year award, which hadn’t been awarded to a Gaucho volleyball player since 2012.</p>\n<p>She received a host of other accolades as well, making both the All-Big West and All-Freshman teams along with notching five Freshman of the Week awards.</p>\n<p>On a national level, Ruddins became the first Gaucho since 2012 to be named to the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) All-American team as an honorable mention, and she also earned honorable mention honors on the AVCA All-Pacific South Region team.</p>\n<p>The year Ruddins had would be considered extraordinary for any player, much less a freshman. To be third in the conference in both kills per set (4.09) and total kills (389) and then sixth in the conference in service aces per set (.31) was no coincidence.</p>\n<p>It shows only the dedication that Ruddins put into practice (redshirting her whole first year to hone her skills) but also her ability to translate what she has learned into an enormous impact on the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB improved by five wins this season, and a lot of that improvement has to do with Ruddins’s exceptional year. Both she and the team have a lot of room to grow; the Gauchos have never made it to the final four of the NCAA tournament, and she still has three years to work on her game. If this year is any indication, however, we could be looking at one of the best talents to ever play for UCSB and a potential NCAA champion as well.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 8 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/","id":1885,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

For someone who will be competing at the highest level of collegiate track in roughly a week, Kuskey’s high school athletic resume is missing something.</p>\n<p>Because track season occurred at the same time as golf season in high school, Kuskey was forced to stick with golf in the spring sports, never getting the shot to become a four-sport athlete. Being so talented at golf, Kuskey’s choice was simple: He continued playing golf, never running track.</p>\n<p>After receiving a one-year deferred admission from USC, his dream school, Kuskey decided to go to SBCC for a year before fighting on as a Trojan. However, after a year in Santa Barbara, there would be no USC Fight Song in Kuskey’s future.</p>\n<p>While at SBCC, Kuskey decided to begin training as a decathlete. Decathletes compete in four track events as well as six field events. Kuskey described his decision to pursue track, “It was always a dream of mine to play a sport in college; I was athletic in high school.” Being a three-sport athlete and then just deciding to give decathlete training a try, Kuskey is more than just “athletic.”</p>\n<p>As he was on the track at SBCC, Kuskey was spotted by someone from UCSB who saw potential in the track and field novice — so much potential, in fact, that Kuskey was convinced to come to UCSB for track and field as a freshman.</p>\n<p>The javelin emerged as Kuskey’s specialty, and all of a sudden, after having never run a day of track in high school, Kuskey was competing at his first NCAA regionals in Austin, Texas, as a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“It was really unexpected, actually, [but] I’ve always sort of been a really competitive type and never really liked the feeling of being bad at something,” Kuskey said. “It’s obviously a lot of work and javelin is a very technical event. It took a lot of endurance.”</p>\n<p>The mindset and practice from succeeding in multiple other sports helped Kuskey just as much as his natural athleticism. Without the discipline and ability to ignore distractions, he wouldn’t be where he is today.</p>\n<p>“Being in a D1 program for the past four years has taught me a lot about time management, at times doing more track than school, double days — everybody does it on the team,” Kuskey said.</p>\n<p>The hard work and dedication has clearly paid off for Kuskey, but perhaps more rewarding have been the experience of being involved with track in college. While there are plans for the renovation of the UCSB track, the well-known poor condition of the track has been bringing the team together.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’re the underdogs sort of unites us. The track team is pretty close, we’re all pretty good friends. We use that underdog mentality to our benefit,” Kuskey said. “It’s pretty cool [when you see a] 250-pound thrower is cheering on the distance runners, and you can feel the energy; everyone feeds off each other.”</p>\n<p>This attitude and environment of track has clearly driven Kuskey to thrive in the sport, but Kuskey isn’t slowing down anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Kuskey is succeeding in more than just sports. He is graduating at the end of this quarter with a degree in political science with an emphasis in international relations, and he’s already been commuting two days a week to Manhattan Beach for an internship in sports marketing.</p>\n<p>Kuskey credits his all-around success to his involvement and experience in sports. “Being an athlete and being on track has prepared me for a work environment, and employers know that.”</p>\n<p>While it may seem reasonable for a graduating senior to be stressed with so much going on, Kuskey is extremely calm and ready for everything to come. Ubiquitous questions of jobs, places to stay and graduation photos have of course been evident this spring for seniors, but Kuskey has had to juggle his track postseason on top of all this.</p>\n<p>Thinking about his life after graduation, Kuskey did manage to crack a joke: “It’ll be pretty interesting for the first time in my life without having 8 a.m. workouts.”</p>\n<p>He’s had to travel to Austin, Texas, and now he’s planning his trip to Eugene, Ore. Having a conversation with Kuskey, you’d never know how much he has on his plate due to his composed nature. The top-24 javelin thrower in the country humbly discussed only some of his achievements, but he won both the Big West Championship and the UCLA-hosted Pac 12 Invitational this year in addition to qualifying for the NCAA Track and Field Championships.</p>\n<p>Traveling to Eugene this year is well-deserved for Kuskey, as he competed in regionals for the third time this year, but he is barely shaken by the intensity of where he’ll be next week on June 8.</p>\n<p>“I’m a little bit nervous. I try not to think about it too much; I’ve been training for this for four years,” Kuskey said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/","id":1871,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1870,1869,1868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Orlando Magic Forward Aaron Gordon Surprises UCSB, Trains in Thunderdome","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-27-at-12.46.06-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-27-at-12.46.06-PM.png?resize=714%2C372&ssl=1","description":"Expect the unexpected as the possibilities are endless here at UCSB as Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon made an appearance Thursday night to show fans love and get some shots up in the Thunderdome. ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A casual browsing of one’s Twitter timeline typically includes the latest news in politics, sports, music, a plethora of opinions, and of course, memes … things wouldn’t be the same without memes.</p>\n<p>But Thursday night was a surprise for the usual NBA fan at UCSB as Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon sent out a tweet that he would be getting some shots up in the Gauchos’ Thunderdome.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I’ll be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCSBbasketball\">@UCSBbasketball</a> THUNDER DOME getting shots up tonight.

But his good deed was prevented from happening as liability concerns during the T-Dome’s after hours prohibited entrance aside from Gordon and his crew.</p>\n<p>But fans waiting in the night managed to get something in return as Gordon’s persistent plea to at least let fans in the gym to take photos was permitted prior to him beginning his workout.</p>\n<p>Although not in attendance, UCSB men’s basketball Head Coach Joe Pasternack’s presence was still felt as Gordon’s appearance was a reminder of the new coach’s aim to reestablish fun and excitement into the Gaucho program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has shown love. Since I’ve been in Santa Barbara, [I figured] I’d peek through here, come through and get workouts in, they’ve always shown love,” Gordon said. “Now that Joe Pasternack is here, he’s shown love to me since I was on the Oakland Soldiers, playing with Archbishop Mitty [High School]. It’s just good to have a friend out here, he gets us in the gym. I wish I could have got everybody in [the Thunderdome], but you know there’s rules and regulations. It’s good to have Joe here, he’s really going to help the program out a lot.”</p>\n<p>During Pasternack’s tenure with the University of Arizona from 2011-2016, Gordon was a “one and done” player for the Wildcats in their 2013-14 season. He is one of many players, including former Wildcat and current Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson who was training in the Thunderdome two weeks ago, that Pasternack played a significant role in when recruiting and developing the two All-American talents.</p>\n<p>Entering his fourth NBA season, Gordon is coming off a career year in which he started in 72 of 80 games and recorded a career-high 12.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The former No. 4 pick of the 2014 NBA Draft is focused on the well-being of his body going into next season after a foot injury gave him trouble entering the All-Star break, which was evident in his underwhelming performance in the 2017 Slam Dunk Contest.</p>\n<p>“That’s the biggest thing, to get healthy. Find a rhythm, get healthy. As long as I’m healthy, everything ‘s going to be golden. I’ma do what I love to do,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>With many aware of his freakish athleticism, Gordon has his sight set on taking his game further. Speculation as to whether or not he fits best at the small forward or power forward position had been up for debate throughout the majority of the season. No permanent answer has emerged regarding Gordon’s placement, but he flourished throughout the season.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4Subr0F21k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>When asked about the area of his game that he is focusing on this offseason, Gordon kept it straightforward – “shooting threes.”</p>\n<p>With that being said, he seems to remain motivated to fill the hybrid/stretch role that Orlando is hoping for him to be. If health can work in his favor, anticipating a breakout season for Gordon may not be too far-fetched.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/","id":1893,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1892,1891,1890],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Life Goes On: UCSB Baseball Reflects on Return to I.V.

The team was all smiles in the locker room until they heard the news of the tragic events that took place in I.V. that evening.</p>\n<p>“We were on the road when that happened, at Davis, actually, and we reached out to the guys not on the travel squad to make sure they were okay,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Despite the shooting, UCSB still had to play a game against UC Davis on Saturday, the final game of the three-game set. For better or for worse, Santa Barbara took the field with heavy hearts and mustered a 6-3 victory to secure a sweep of the Aggies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the Gauchos finally came home after their win on Saturday, they didn’t come home to the same place they had left just a few days ago. The once lively campus was instead filled with sorrow and pain.</p>\n<p>Instead of being able to celebrate a sweep of UC Davis and possibly a chance at making the postseason, many of the players had to learn quickly the horrors of what had happened.</p>\n<p>Walking off the pitch after a final win of the season on Tuesday defeating USC 11-2, the UCSB men’s baseball found itself in the same place it had been three years ago.</p>\n<p>Moments before the game, the team held a moment of silence to remember the tragedy that befell UCSB. Whether it was a player, coach or someone who worked with UCSB athletics, the tragedy made them realize that changes were necessary for their own lives and beyond.</p>\n<p>“Because baseball allows these kids to have their own culture, they had a healthy distraction and each other, really, to help them cope with this,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>One of the people who did not travel with the team three years ago was Sports Information Director Andrew Wagner. An S.I.D.’s job requires them to write previews and recaps of the teams they cover while releasing any breaking news about the team in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Wagner still serves as the S.I.D. of multiple sports, including the baseball team that he was covering at the time.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t travel with the team on that long trip, and despite having graduated a couple years back, I still lived in Isla Vista,” Wagner said. “So I was in town when this happened; I actually lived about 100 feet from the 7-Eleven where part of the shooting happened, and I just remember all the texts and calls asking if I was okay. It almost just didn’t feel real. This isn’t supposed to happen here, but it did.”</p>\n<p>Despite not being a student anymore, the event stuck around in Wagner’s mind.</p>\n<p>“It was just a night-and-day type of experience after the shooting,” Wagner said. “For a while after that, everybody just felt numb; it was weird. You just don’t imagine something like that happening in California,” Wagner said, “much less Santa Barbara and much less at UCSB where everything is more carefree, relaxed and happy.</p>\n<p>Andrew made note of the fact that this shooting was a sort of wake-up call for him, and he, like many others, tried to cope with the horrific incident that took UCSB by storm.</p>\n<p>“One of the craziest experiences I’ve had was the vigil at Harder Stadium, where both sides of the stands were packed tight but there was no noise. Everybody was so sad and in a state of disbelief,” Wagner said. “That vigil really hit close to home in multiple ways because, for a while, UCSB became known for partying and the shooting, and it made me so sad because this is such a great university and that’s not always the reputation it gets.”</p>\n<p>For Checketts in particular, a man with children of his own, this tragedy brought forth the memory of another shooting that made him re-evaluate.</p>\n<p>Checketts said. “When Sandy Hook happened, it opened my eyes. Having young kids and looking at those little faces made me sad and angry. Looking at this from our community standpoint, it was obviously scary. Isla Vista is my community. I live just around the corner. When it happens so close to home, it sure makes it a lot more real. Unfortunately, from a country standpoint, it happens so often and at such a high rate relative to other developed countries, it gets frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Since this shooting, Checketts has been involved in trying to find solutions to the current gun issue the United States faces.</p>\n<p>“There were victims in the Isla Vista tragedy that weren’t caused by gunfire and I recognize that, but as a 40-year-old man with young kids, this tragedy has motivated me to look more closely at how we handle our guns in this country. In California, we have seen some progress on this issue with some recent legislation, but more needs to be done…Families shouldn’t have to go through this kind of pain as regularly as they do in our country.”</p>\n<p>Three years later, the pain the community once felt has subsided, but it still lingers around this time. UCSB defeating USC on Tuesday wasn’t the Yankees winning the World Series after 9/11 or the Saints winning a Super Bowl after Katrina, but it was a sign that life does, in fact, go on. You can try to improve the problems we face every day, and there is beauty in that.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can completely stop bad things from happening across our country, but we have other developed countries with a fraction of the gun violence that we have and should be looking at their models and potential solutions to reduce our risk of gun violence. The tragedy in Isla Vista is another unfortunate reminder that we aren’t immune to gun violence, even in paradise.” Checketts said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dangerous. Untamed.</p>\n<p>These are the common misconceptions about life here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Overcoming, this false illusion has always been difficult, but the tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014, was an unfortunate yet compelling reminder of the love and unity that reside within the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>Prior to this date, preparing to graduate from St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif., and having already verbally committed to the UCSB men’s basketball team back in Aug. 2013, current junior shooting guard Gabe Vincent seemed to have everything figured out.</p>\n<p>But he, too, once shared uncertainty before this decision, yet his perspective was corrected as he was gradually integrated into the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>“When I was in high school and people would bring up [UCSB], it started to get a bad reputation. Everybody knew it was a party school, but that’s kind of a two-sided coin. People like to party and have fun and go to school, but some people are discouraged by that,” Vincent explained. “I for sure was at first. When you think of UCSB, most of the time that’s what you think of. Yes, you get a great education, but that party scene over there might be too wild. [But] the more I came out and got involved with the community and saw what they were about and got more comfortable here, [I saw] that people are in the library 24/7, people are grinding, taking classes, and that’s just a way for them to let loose. The community is so small that people are all together; it allows everyone to enjoy life together, which is awesome because not many places can have that.”</p>\n<p>As someone who had confirmed his love for basketball in the sixth grade and who was determined to put his all into the sport once he started playing at the AAU level, Vincent saw the advantages of UCSB’s location, beautiful women and Division I status, which seemed to provide an opportunity any prospective student-athlete would desire to seize.</p>\n<p>But the potential to be the university’s next star player with such incentives at his fingertips took a backseat during his realization of UCSB’s ability to bond and unite after the tragic loss of innocent lives just a year before his official enrollment at the school.</p>\n<p>“I came out here a lot, I took a few unofficial [visits] just to come see the guys practice. I had been out in I.V. and had seen that culture and kind of got accustomed to it to a point that it already felt like home. That was a big thing for me coming here because you have to be able to live somewhere when you’re not playing basketball, too,” Vincent said. “So when I heard the news about the shooting, that’s something that, even if you’re not attached to the school emotionally or physically, when you read that kind of tragedy, that hits your heart because that’s something that should never happen and is terrible to read or hear.”</p>\n<p>“When you are attached to it, like we are now, and I kind of was in a way then, it definitely hit home. It was sad to hear; I remember I came out the following weekend because I was coming up on another unofficial [visit] to see the guys practice, and even they were down,” Vincent said. “Looking out to the streets of I.V., they were dead quiet, nobody was out. The whole community was mourning what had happened. That was eye-opening because it’s not just everybody out here for themselves. Even though there are cliques or groups, we are still one strong community. The way people came together for that was inspiring.”</p>\n<p>Rather than be deterred from his choice to attend UCSB after such a horrific moment that made headlines nationwide, Vincent’s empathy influenced his newfound interpretation of such a unique community.</p>\n<p>The foundation for this compassion comes from Vincent’s parents, Cynthia and Franklyn, who are both psychologists. Once quoted saying his upbringing was “different,” Vincent holds a perspective of this three-year anniversary that only he can understand.</p>\n<p>“To me, honestly, psychology, even though there’s many facets of it, a lot of the times it’s just being able to read in-between the lines. A lot of people are going to put on a front or show this or that, but that might not be what they’re really feeling or showing,” Vincent said. “I think that plays a big role in terms of relating to people and being able to talk to them and gauge how a conversation will flow [to see if] they’re upset or figure out what they want to talk about; you can use [psychology] in so many different ways.”</p>\n<p>“Seeing the guys and the community in that way, you could see it was genuine grief. People were really going through it and it was a struggle for everyone. Naturally, when that happens, you start thinking about yourself and how you could’ve done better. Even though you might have not been directly in the situation, you start to think, ‘Man, I could have done that differently,’ and that could’ve changed somebody else’s life in a positive way.Unfortunately it had to happen in that way, but I think it was eye-opening and some people made some changes.”</p>\n<p>As a leader on this season’s team that included only one senior, the impact of the tragedy isn’t as evident. But, the fact that this year’s graduating class will be the last of the UCSB and Isla Vista communities that were in the areas during the incident is still very prevalent.</p>\n<p>“I think there has been an unbelievable amount of support, with the blue lights and the awareness around campus. But I feel like as one generation comes and goes and [with] this senior class being the last [group] that were really here for it, I think that plays a major role in it kind of [being] forgotten, which I hope it doesn’t because I hope that community can stay strong,” Vincent said. “A lot of universities have four years in, four years out, and it’s almost like a new culture or new tradition. I hope that’s something that can stay alive, and hopefully, through the different support systems on campus, they can keep the community strong together and let them know that things can happen, it doesn’t matter where you are. There’s been many other instances at universities, and I think that it’s important to not keep these things relevant but on your mind.”</p>\n<p>Whether or not time heals all wounds can only be determined by the individual. While the pain and disbelief of what took place on May 23, 2014, still causes grief for many, the recovery from this tragedy is still taking place and can be sustained with a communal effort.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista is a special place. It’s right on the beach, it’s right next to campus. It’s a great diverse group, and I think it’s important to keep in mind, especially with this class leaving, and we have some younger guys on the team [who are like] ‘It’s the anniversary of what?’ and you can already kind of see it becoming forgotten,” Vincent said. “I don’t think it’s anything to run away from, the history of that [event], because you can’t change time. [Embracing] that and keeping the discussion open, be willing to talk about it and let people know what happened. Obviously you don’t want history to repeat itself; that’s the last thing this community could need or want.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/","id":1890,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1889,1888,1887],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ball Is Life.

However, various sports news leaders continue to give LaVar a platform to utilize. Whether it be him defending the $495 price tag of Lonzo’s signature shoe or him making comparisons to Steph Curry or LeBron James, headlines have constantly played into LaVar’s ploy.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, the “Big Baller Brand” head honcho has done a good job of utilizing the exposure he has received. He’s been the mastermind of a publicity stunt that has enabled him to put the “BBB” brand on a pedestal that some support or hate.</p>\n<p>While the pricing for the “ZO2” signature shoe is too high, I respect the vision of the family business. The plan to invest in yourself is genius. Why not have complete creative control over how you mold and develop your own brand?</p>\n<p>Some may consider it costly considering that Nike, Under Armour and Adidas each decided not to sign Lonzo to a shoe deal. But self-investment is something no other player has done, with the closest being LeBron James and his lifetime deal with Nike.</p>\n<p>The vision is clear, but the logistics behind the brand will have to be altered in order for it to grow in the years to come. How to do so isn’t exactly clear at the moment due to the fact that Lonzo has yet to be drafted and even play a game in the NBA.</p>\n<p>After a decision that likely included the input of LaVar for Lonzo to not participate in the NBA Combine, it is no surprise that Lonzo will only work out for the Lakers prior to the NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>These are the circumstances that have left me with mixed emotions regarding LaVar’s role in Lonzo’s transition to the NBA.</p>\n<p>Although LaVar’s intentions surely aren’t meant to devalue his son’s talents, he has steadily added pressure to the already daunting expectations Lonzo is entering the league with, especially if he ends up going to the Lakers, who are looking to solidify a franchise player who will end their decline of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s unfair that people make claims in hopes of Lonzo being a bust or having an underwhelming career due to the actions of his father. Many presume that Lonzo’s laidback demeanor is a sign of submissiveness to his father or that of a kid who never had any say regarding his basketball career.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s the case or not cannot be determined. Yet, in the meantime, the battle between LaVar Ball and naysayers can only be resolved in a matter of time.</p>\n<p>And that’s to allow Lonzo’s game to speak for itself.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77942\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77942\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/","id":1889,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1888,1887,1886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Heir to the Throne: Why Giannis Will One Day Usurp LeBron","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-13-at-11.48.15-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-13-at-11.48.15-AM.png?resize=628%2C542&ssl=1","description":"With time comes new superstars.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on Dec. 6, 1994, Antetokounmpo was only 18 years old when he was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, making him the youngest in the 2013 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>However, his rise to stardom started inside of Greece’s second division basketball league. Here he managed a 9.5 points and 5.0 rebounds per game average over 26 total games for Filathlitikos, which sparked conversation as his potential began to be noticed. Spanish clubs like Barcelona and Zaragoza then began to show their interest in him and touted his prodigious ability.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Antetokounmpo remained in Greece until the conclusion of the 2012-13 season. His next move was then perhaps the wisest decision of his life: become eligible for the NBA Draft. Then the rest was history.</p>\n<p>Well, not exactly history. Presently, Antetokounmpo is respected and perhaps even feared by his peers, but let’s look at the early moments of his professional career.</p>\n<p>Following his first round, No. 15 overall selection by the Bucks, Antetokounmpo gradually made an impact on the court. In his first three NBA seasons he averaged 12.1 points, 3.0 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. Not particularly standout numbers, however, he earned enough accolades along the way to promote his projection toward greatness.</p>\n<p>In his rookie year, he totaled 61 blocks which led all rookies in the NBA, thus earning himself a spot on the All-Rookie Second Team roster. His physical prowess was first recognized during his sophomore season when he was invited to participate in the NBA Slam Dunk contest. Later that year, Antetokounmpo also helped his team achieve its first playoff win since its 2009-10 campaign. In just his third season, he etched himself into Milwaukee Bucks history with the most triple-doubles in a single season.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t look like he’s sweating or even breathing hard,” Bucks Head Coach Jason Kidd said when interviewed about Giannis’ play, “and that shows just how talented he really is.”</p>\n<p>Over the years, Giannis has received similar praise from his idols like Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson; however, none as directly valuable as from the King himself: LeBron James.</p>\n<p>“A guy that can handle the ball at that size is special … at that speed, with his length. I think J-Kidd does a great job of placing him in the lineup where he sees a mismatch, and so he’s all over the floor.”</p>\n<p>This quote not only puts Antetokounmpo’s young and outstanding career into perspective, but also brings us to his comparisons with LeBron, currently the best player in the game.</p>\n<p>Yes, best player in the game. Sure he may not be in MVP contention amongst the names of Russell Westbrook and James Harden; but no one else can match LeBron’s level of speed and power. Well, perhaps Antetokounmpo will one day.</p>\n<p>In terms of this regular season’s production, the pair each had noteworthy seasons. LeBron averaged 26.4 points, 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game whereas Antetokounmpo maintained an average of 22.9 points, 5.4 assists and 8.7 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The two also started side by side in the 2017 NBA All-Star Game as members of the first team roster. When the Cavaliers visited the Bucks back in November, Antetokounmpo led his team to a 118-101 victory after scoring a total of 34 points, 12 rebounds, five steals, five assists and two blocks all whilst being matched up with LeBron. The two later acknowledged each others efforts with a respectful post-game hug, but from watching that game one can tell how special Antetokounmpo will be.</p>\n<p>As for the remainder of Giannis’s season this year, he scored a career high of 41 points in a February game against the Lakers, became the youngest All-Star in franchise history and, most especially, led his team in all five of the major record categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.</p>\n<p>Altogether Antetokounmpo’s athletic skills and raw talent can only pose a resemblance to LeBron’s. Each player has a unique capacity to strike panic into opponents when they’re headed toward the rim with both size and speed.</p>\n<p>However, it can be understood that in both statistic and legacy, Antetokounmpo has a while to go before catching up to LeBron. Although, he still has plenty of time to do so as he’s only 22 years old.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77766\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77766\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/","id":1888,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1887,1886,1885],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
