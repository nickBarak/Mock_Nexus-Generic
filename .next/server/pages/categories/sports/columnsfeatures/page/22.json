And the Giants are definitely not one of them… kidding! Only kidding. I fully realize the intense love that over half of the student body at UCSB feels for this talented group of goofballs, led by none other than a guy dubbed “the Freak.” However, the Giants, in their Halloween-themed uniforms, have one pumpkin in particularto thank for their postseason success.</p>\n<p>I am here to shed light on the little spark that is Cody Ross. Over time, fans of baseball have come to expect a certain something when the fall classic hits. I am talking about each team’s Mr. October. Sometimes he varies per series, sometimes he is consistent throughout the entire playoffs, but he is always there. Often a come-from-nowhere type guy, each team’s Mr. October seems to hit his stride just in time to lift his team, his fans, and his city to championship fervor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cody Ross is that such player for the Giants. Dismissed with the wave of a hand by the lowly Florida Marlins, the Giants are his fifth major league team in seven years. However, he seems to like where he landed, as his stats in the 2010 postseason show that he’ll be an honorary NorCal bro until the end. In seven games, he has four homeruns, seven RBI, eight hits, a .350 hitting percentage, and a .435 on base percentage. Whenever Ross steps up to the plate, he is as sure to get on or around the basesas Lindsay Lohan is to wind up in jail again.</p>\n<p>And Ross isn’t hitting off Grandma Jo over there. No, sir. He is hitting home runs off of such pitching legends as the Phillies’ two Roy’s, Halladay and Oswalt. Just a mere four hours ago, he drove in a run off of pitching ace Cole Hamels, the one-time boy wonder. Ross has not only outperformed both his competition and teammates, but he is straight up trumping the usual heavy-hitters. Ryan Howard, the Philly bomber, has registered zero HR’s in the playoffs. Jimmy Rollins, always a consistent hitter, has  four RBI’s and three hits, but only a .286 on base percentage. Ross’ teammate, Aubrey Huff, known for his RBI prowess over the past season, has only one RBI thus far, with a .217 hitting average.</p>\n<p>Who knows how long Ross will be boss of the Bay? Maybe he’s simply best kept secret in this perfect bubble of the playoffs, separate from any other time in the long, enduring baseball season. Or maybe he’ll ignite into a late-blooming Hall of Famer. Whichever it is, for this moment, in this postseason, Ross rules.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/","id":2831,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2830,2829,2828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: I.V.

For the past hour I had been chasing little shorebreak swells near the beach access while a group of drunken fools howled obscene stuff through a megaphone at us. Those fucking I.V. bros.</p>\n<p>I.V. bros are a special breed. They’ve got all the tendencies of normal brociety, but they’re even more ignorant, callous and stupid than the rest.</p>\n<p>It’s not just their strict regimen of playing Snappa by 9 a.m. and brofighting by 3 a.m., or their innate ability to break other peoples’ valuables and smash anything made out of glass in the most inconvenient of places. What makes me hate DP bros so much is that they can’t stop themselves from throwing large, often usable pieces of furniture and other household goods off of balconies.</p>\n<p>The “thudsplitcrack! ‘Yaaaa Bro!’” coming from shore almost made me lose my shit. A big wooden dresser tumbled down from the 6600 block of DP and onto the beach. Sharks, dolphins and crabs do not eat abandoned waste, you filthy polluters. Someone with a heart and a sense of respect for the environment actually picks all of that shit up and disposes of it properly.</p>\n<p>I hate those miserable polluting bastards.</p>\n<p>It had started as a quick, in between class sesh. The sun wasn’t shining, but to me the weather was sweet — like home in Northern California. Brisk and foggy. I was grateful that at least a few levelheaded people had chosen not to take a speedy, techno-infused trip down Taaka road to blackout alley at midday.</p>\n<p>A lull, and then a wave came.</p>\n<p>“To the rescue, here I am.”</p>\n<p>Being in the water listening to Bob triggered a memory of Bull Bay — an area 10 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica. I stayed there once for a day and a night as I passed through the country. Bull Bay is without a doubt a rough place, and thinking of my time there quickly had me brooding on the stark contrasts between here and Jamaica: standards of living, American wastefulness, what we consider a tough day.</p>\n<p>“Want you to know just if you can/Where I stand, know, know, know, where I stand”</p>\n<p>We throw away clothing, food and materials at an unhealthy, disgustingly vain rate. If it’s at Costco, it will always be available, we assume.</p>\n<p>The world is sick. The privileged members of brociety living all around me don’t know how lucky they are.</p>\n<p>“So to the rescue, to the rescue, to the rescue/ Awake from your sleep and slumber/ Today could be your lucky number/ Sun is shining and the weather is sweet.”</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus<em> surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld might be upset when he finds out that one of the sports eds threw a shitty desk off his balcony last weekend just to see what would happen.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27702\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27702\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/","id":2794,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2793,2792,2791],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Flex Decisions for Flexible People","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In fantasy football, the most common dilemma for an owner is who to start in a given position week in and week out.

This means that while they certainly cannot earn you a win by themselves, they will also not hurt you so badly that you will lose because of them.</p>\n<p>I like to start running backs in the flex position. Unlike wide receivers (who can only earn you points if they receive a significant amount of targets from their quarterback), a starting running back, or even one who is in a time share with another back, is usually guaranteed around 15 touches per game. He may not have a huge day, but he will have the opportunity to earn you enough points to push your point total.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at Seattle Seahawks’ running back Justin Forsett. Although officially designated as the team’s starting running back, Forsett has so far been sharing his job, first with Julius Jones, and now with Marshawn Lynch. Despite this unfortunate fact, Forsett has still been averaging just over 12 carries per game, which has translated to over 60 yards per game the last three weeks for an average of over seven fantasy points per week. While it’s not spectacular, it’s also not horrible, and if that yardage is accompanied by a touchdown — as it was in Forsett’s last game — it can mean another six points and a very respectable fantasy day.</p>\n<p>Another example is Chicago Bears’ RB Matt Forté, who despite playing in the pass-first offense of Mike Martz, has been able to average nearly 13 fantasy points per week on an average of fewer than 12 carries.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to start a wide receiver at the flex position, be sure to start someone who gets enough targets to be useful every week, no matter the matchup. Normally, this will end up being a receiver who plays out of the slot position, because quarterbacks trust those receivers to get them out of tight spots. Since every quarterback gets into trouble several times a game, slot receivers are usually targeted often enough to make up for the fact that they don’t get many yards.</p>\n<p>Patriots’ wide receiver Wes Welker is the quintessential flex receiver. Tom Brady trusts him to get open when he needs him to, and so looks his way often in a variety of situations. This trust has led to 33 receptions for Welker so far, setting him on pace for 106 by the end of the season. Because Welker gets targeted so often and has so many receptions, he can be counted on to provided solid fantasy numbers week after week, as can other receivers like him.</p>\n<p>The key to success at the flex position is consistency. While they may not get an enormous amount of touches per game, they get enough work that fantasy owners can hope for at least some points each week. Consistency is exactly what you want out of a flex player, as the flex position is for players who can be trusted to provide enough points to cover your big game players, who tend to be more boom or bust, on days when they, well… bust. Whether you choose to play a running back or a wide receiver, make sure you pick someone you trust not to drop the ball with the game on the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Pick Up of the Week:</strong> While I’d like to recommend Deion Branch, I find it hard to tell people to pick up any Patriots player based off one good week that was probably due to Tom Brady’s tendency to spread the ball around. Instead, I’ll tell you to keep Branch in mind but focus on Detroit Lions’ quarterback Matthew Stafford. When he returns from injury after the Lions’ bye week, he’ll take over an offense that is powered by running back Jahvid Best and wide receiver Calvin Johnson. With his talent and those weapons at his disposal, Stafford could provide a good option for anyone struggling at the QB position. Stafford is still available in 77 percent of leagues, but I have a feeling that’s about to change.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist <em>Josh Greenberg flexes his muscles like the running backs and wide receivers at the flex position.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27704\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27704\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/","id":2808,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2807,2806,2805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Zsombor Vincze: The Hungarian Hurricane","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Senior utility Zsombor Vincze of the men’s water polo team is unique both in and out of the water.

There he met Bruce Wigo, the tournament director, whose son Wolf Wigo coached at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bruce mentioned that his son was looking for players. Enamored by the American lifestyle, Vincze agreed.</p>\n<p>“I talked to Wolf [Wigo] on the phone and was immediately in,” the Hungarian native said.</p>\n<p>Vincze was soon on a plane to Santa Barbara to begin his life in America. In the water, the then-freshman immediately made an impact, earning All-MPSF Honorable Mention Team honors after scoring 30 goals and dishing out 23 assists. The following year, he accumulated 46 more goals and 25 assists to earn the same conference honors. After sitting out 2008 with a medical red-shirt, Vincze earned his third honorable mention award in 2009.</p>\n<p>“He has a lot of great aspects to his game,” freshman driver Matt Gronow said. “He is an amazing shooter, real smart, surprisingly fast and strong as hell.”</p>\n<p>Although he adapted quickly to American water polo, Vincze initially struggled with English.</p>\n<p>“I had to carry a pocket dictionary with me everywhere,” Vincze said. “And I couldn’t express myself emotionally for the first year.”</p>\n<p>Although he could not convey his emotions, Vincze said his most difficult struggle involved the use of humor.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t able to joke,” Vincze said. “And that’s an essential part of me.”</p>\n<p>Last year at a women’s water polo game, Vincze and some friends performed synchronized swimming, which the crowd received favorably.</p>\n<p>“Everybody thought it was hilarious,” Golic said.</p>\n<p>Despite developing the ability to joke, some of Vincze’s friends jokingly insist his English still is not up to par.</p>\n<p>According to Gronow, Vincze’s roommate, Vincze has an “annoying” habit where he finds new English words that he likes and will perpetually say them.</p>\n<p>“I like the flavor of some words,” the Hungarian native said. “And I will create circumstances where it [the word] has to pop-up.”</p>\n<p>Another language quirk for Vincze is his use of abbreviations. Vincze abhors the use of mediated abbreviations such as</p>\n<p>“LOL,” “WTF,” and “OMG.” To poke fun at his roommates, Vincze uses them in everyday spoken conversation, starting a trend on the team.</p>\n<p>According to his roommates, Vincze also has terrible taste in music.</p>\n<p>“His music taste is horrible,” Gronow said. “He likes crap and will play his Hungarian music to the maximum volume and sing along.”</p>\n<p>Vincze disagrees with Gronow.</p>\n<p>“I have the most sophisticated taste in music,” Vincze said. “Matty’s taste is horrible.”</p>\n<p>Golic, a fellow Eastern European, agrees with Vincze on this issue.</p>\n<p>“I think his taste is great,” Golic said. “He knows good music for sure.”</p>\n<p>According to his teammates, Vincze has several other quirks, including pre-game rituals that red-shirt freshman Paddy Kelleher calls “ridiculous Hungarian stretches.”</p>\n<p>“Some of them probably shouldn’t be done in a speedo,” he said.</p>\n<p>Like all athletes, Vincze appreciates his rest. However, he probably appreciates it a little more. The Hungary native uses the aid of a sound machine to sleep.</p>\n<p>“He sleeps with a little sound machine to calm him, like a baby,” Golic said. “We all make fun of him for it.”</p>\n<p>Vincze and the rest of the squad play again at Campus Pool on Oct. 23 at 12 p.m. in a conference match against Long Beach State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/","id":2787,"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson"},"related":[2786,2785,2784],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Speaces Pieces: Brett Favre SUCKS","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I used to like him.

When he retired for the first time in Green Bay, we felt his sincerity and teared up with him. And then he came back for the Jets, which was weird, but acceptable. One more go for #4? Sure! And I’ll take those Wrangler jeans while I’m at it, too. He grasped our attention and support when he led them to an 8-3 record, and earned our empathy when they sputtered out in the end. Then he retired again, only to come back the next year in a Vikings uniform.</p>\n<p>However, he did do extremely well that year, almost getting to the Super Bowl in those hideous eggplant purple unis. And then he retired again, only to come back to the team with maybe two minutes left on the clock in the 2010 training camp. Cool, Favre. Way to cop out big time. However, this move proved to be pivotal, as at this exact point in time, Favre lost the collective hearts of the nation.</p>\n<p>People respected him for gutting it out and playing for the pure love of the game. Even though his tendonitis began to catch up with him over these past years, he still had the loyalty of (most of) America.</p>\n<p>Being bombarded with commercials of Favre selling everything from tractors to rifles was palatable due to the fact that we could stand him, no matter how much our undying love for him was beginning to wane.</p>\n<p>However, with new events coming to light — a couple of inappropriate, gross-out photos sent via text by Mr. Favre to a Jets hostess — his character is now called into question. America can accept an aging star losing his abilities to Father Time. However, you begin to lose us at “scandal” or “extramarital affair.” Indeed, I always try to separate the player from the person. In this case, however, I can’t overlook how selfish and egotistical he has become during his post-Packers era. If the allegations that he sent those yuck pictures to the Jets employee are true, then he, as well as his reputation, is worse off than I thought. It is sad that he didn’t quit while he was ahead, because the road ahead of him is sure to be a long one, and maybe a lonely one, too.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus columnist <em>Julia Speace is still kind of charmed by Favre’s Wrangler commercials with the Golden Retrievers.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/speaces-pieces-brett-favre-sucks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/speaces-pieces-brett-favre-sucks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/speaces-pieces-brett-favre-sucks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/speaces-pieces-brett-favre-sucks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/speaces-pieces-brett-favre-sucks/","id":2790,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2789,2788,2787],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: NFL Wide Open in Week Six","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Like Paris Hilton’s legs on any given night, the NFL is wide open this year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>[media-credit name=”Ian Sander” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/sunday-funday-nfl-wide-open-week/sports-is2-4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-27345\"><img data-attachment-id=\"27345\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/sunday-funday-nfl-wide-open-week/sports-is2-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sports-IS2.jpg?fit=640%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,487\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sports-IS2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sports-IS2.jpg?fit=250%2C190&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sports-IS2.jpg?fit=640%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sports-IS2-250x190.jpg?resize=250%2C190\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"190\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-27345\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sports-IS2.jpg?resize=250%2C190&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sports-IS2.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p>\n<p><span></span>Heading into week six, there are zero undefeated teams and three winless teams.

Is the Manning Magic wearing off? The answer is no. Anytime you have Manning on your team, you will make the playoffs, as history shows.</p>\n<p>New Orleans is 3-2 after going 13-3 last year. The Saints are missing safety Darren Sharper on defense, and eagerly await his return from injury. The Saints’ offense — ranked #10 after finishing last year at #1 —  may be missing Reggie Bush more than you think.</p>\n<p>After going 12-4 last year with Brett Favre in charge, the Minnesota Vikings are 1-3. Even with the newly acquired Randy Moss, the Vikings may be in trouble. Moss will catch some long touchdowns, but ultimately it will just lead to a lot of jump balls thrown by Favre. It’s hard to be skeptical of Favre’s ability to get it done because he has always done it, but the man is 42 fucking years old. After throwing 33 touchdowns and only seven interceptions all of last year, Favre already has seven picks to go with his five touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Dallas, coming into the season with 8-to-1 odds to win the Super Bowl (tied with New Orleans and only behind the favorite, Indy) is a dismal 1-3 after an 11-5 record last year. I have to say, I enjoy few things more than the Cowboys’ failures. Is it me, or does Wade Phillips just stand on the sideline (probably daydreaming of eating cake) and just make either really happy faces or really sad faces? Does the man do any coaching? If the Cowboys don’t turn it around fast, Phillips will be gone — presumably with a sad face on.</p>\n<p>The San Diego Chargers are 2-3 after finishing the season 13-3 last year. There is really nothing to worry about here. Traditionally slow starters, the Chargers will be fine. It seems safe to say that they are missing LT and Vincent Jackson on offense but others have stepped up. San Diego’s offense is ranked #1 in the league, and its defense is ranked #2. The Chargers will end up winning the division as always.</p>\n<p>The strange thing about these dominant teams underachieving thus far is that no teams have stepped up to take their place among the elite. The playing field is seemingly much more even this year. Every team has a weakness, and there are fewer pushover teams just as there are fewer juggernauts that can be penciled in for a win every week.</p>\n<p>So, is this good for the league? Maybe not if you are a betting man, but I say “yes.” With most teams in the middle of the pack, many games will be determined based on matchups. Strategy, coaching, and execution may turn out to be more vital than in years past, where there has been a much wider gap between the better and the worse teams.</p>\n<p>Will this trend continue throughout the year? It is almost impossible to say, but hey, that’s why we love football.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Staff Writer <em>Ryan Porush swears it only took him a few seconds to come up with that lead.

I haven’t surfed in about a week, and the couple of weeks before this one I was only able to surf a few tantalizing times. Sweet, but not filling.</p>\n<p>I’ve constantly chided myself for having priorities that take me away from the calm and consciousness of the sea. Throughout my time in I.V., the ocean’s presence mere yards (and a cliff face) away has been a constant that I’ve been able to turn to when all else is havoc. Stress factors run rampant in the university setting, especially when one tries to have a personal life and a budding professional one as well.</p>\n<p>The ocean is an life force responsible for a lot of what is good in the world. I believe in it and in a strange way I also almost worship it. It’s hard to completely explain the swelling of spirit that a simple float in a chilly sea will give you. The force of the ocean emphasizes the inevitability of life, that humanity’s mark on the cosmic timeline is a miniscule blip – fragile, nondescript and apt to fade from existence as naturally and easily as a tide pulling a piece of driftwood from shore. For some reason I find that comforting – it makes me feel like a part of the grand scheme of the world, not like someone embedded in a frantic society that can’t get its wits about it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The wonders of the sea are vivid and incredible. I never grow tired of being in and around great tidal bodies, nor could I exhaust my appreciation for the ocean’s marvels and quirks. I have pledged to myself to never underestimate the power of the ocean. For those of you who’ve been following my column, that was another Surfer’s Code reference (Read it! It’s by Shaun Thompson.).</p>\n<p>We all know the statistic that more is known about outer space than about the depths of Earth’s oceans. It’s almost like an alternate reality, full of massive volcanoes, giant trenches, and eight-legged magicians possessing the ability to wrestle sharks and shoot ink. The anglerfish, for example, strikes me as a particularly vivid representation of the wonders of the sea and its citizens; it has a fleshy growth protruding from its forehead that functions as a lure. Some deep-sea anglerfish even produce an eerie light from their lure – you’ve probably already seen a demonic representation of this same fish in Finding Nemo.</p>\n<p>Last Saturday, I had arrived home from a chaotic day with the light fading. Rather than attempting to enjoy a crazy I.V. party that night, a good friend and I loaded up with frozen squid, raw chicken, fishing poles, and all the necessary late-night fishing accoutrement. The pier was a happy reality. Couples strolled down the planked walkway to enjoy the ocean’s aura, scuba divers popped up out of the dark water below with loud exhalations and chatted to each other about the crabs they had seen on the bottom. Life was simple. I didn’t get to surf this week, but at least I have that experience fresh in my mind.</p>\n<p>As much as I might gain from keeping my insight about the wonders of the ocean to myself, I’m more passionate about ending the misery of those who have spent the majority of their existence landlocked or unappreciative of the sea. It’s right there, and it’s good for you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27232\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/nuglets-wisdom-life-lemons-fishing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27232\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/nuglets-wisdom-life-lemons-fishing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/nuglets-wisdom-life-lemons-fishing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/nuglets-wisdom-life-lemons-fishing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/nuglets-wisdom-life-lemons-fishing/","id":2788,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2787,2786,2785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People:  For Every Fantasy Injury, an Upside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For coaches as well as fantasy owners, an injury to a star player can decimate playoff hopes.

No matter how much that boo-boo hurts, there is no crying in football, so slap a bandage on it and read on.</p>\n<p>There is no way to know who is going to get injured or when, so there is very little you can do to prepare. However, you can look at the depth charts.</p>\n<p>It’s the first thing every fantasy owner should do when you first draft players: Know the depth charts of the teams of the players you drafted. You don’t need to spend hours studying rosters. Just know who the second and third string guys are and which player is more likely to step up should your starter sustain an injury. If you have a spot available on your roster, it is also a good idea to pick up one of the backups, just in case that starter does go down.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let’s start with the Kansas City Chiefs, who recently lost their starting running back, Clinton Portis, for 4-6 weeks. When Portis returns, he could regain at least a share of the starting role.  For now, the Chiefs will probably insert their number two running back, Ryan Torain, into the starting role. In the few opportunities he has been given so far this season, Torain has racked up 156 yards on 41 attempts — over three yards per carry — and one touchdown.</p>\n<p>While last week’s 40-yard performance against Green Bay was disappointing, Torain has shown in previous efforts that he has the ability to get the job done. More importantly, he has the support of Head Coach Mike Shanahan and very little in the way of competition from other guys in the Kansas City depth chart, so he has a lot of value while Portis is out. Torain is still available in almost 20 percent of ESPN leagues, but he is going fast.</p>\n<p>At the wide receiver position, owners of Rams wide receiver Mark Clayton will be disappointed to learn that after injuring his knee on Sunday, Clayton will be forced to miss the rest of the season. However, though his season is lost, his owners still have a chance to salvage theirs. If you look at the Rams’ depth chart you will see that rookie wide receiver Mardy Gilyard, who can be picked up in almost 100% of leagues, is set to take on an extended role in the Rams’ offense. While it is unlikely that Gilyard will instantly match Clayton’s level of production, someone is going to have to catch those extra passes from quarterback Sam Bradford. Gilyard is worth a look from anyone who owned Clayton.</p>\n<p>That same rule applies for owners of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who may not be able to play in week six. If you have no other viable replacement, Packers backup QB, rookie Matt Flynn, would be a wise add for this week — if only as a precaution. In the event that Rodgers can’t play, Flynn will take over the offense for the week and for that reason could provide a solid fantasy performance for any owner willing to gamble on him.</p>\n<p>Knowing who stands to replace who in the event of an injury is all fine and dandy, but it will only get you so far if you don’t understand how individual coaches handle injuries. This brings us to the second point in dealing with injuries: Know how different coaches react to losing a starter. Some coaches will simply put in the guy who is next on the depth chart and wait until the starter returns. Others, however, are not that simple.</p>\n<p>Saints Head Coach Sean Peyton exemplifies a coach who tends to replace injured starters with committees of healthy players, making it difficult to know who is going to get the bulk of the work from week to week. Peyton, for example, has chosen to fill the hole left by starting running back Pierre Thomas with a committee of Ladell Betts and Chris Ivory. Although Betts has been productive on his own in the past, it will be difficult to predict how often he will touch the ball while sharing carries with Ivory. This ends up negating any potential value of either player, since neither can be relied upon to produce consistently. Any owner who picks up either Betts or Ivory without first knowing how Peyton deals with injuries would be making a mistake.</p>\n<p>Star players get injured just like anyone else. In all likelihood, you won’t find other stars to replace them. Still, most owners fail to take into account the fact that someone needs to fill the void that the injured player left on his team, and that the replacement player will have value as long as the star is injured. By knowing how coaches like to handle injuries and who is next in line on the depth chart, you may be able to prevent an injury from harming your playoff chances. Real men may play through injuries, but real fantasy owners work around them.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>Staff Writer Josh Greenberg is a real man and a real fantasy owner.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/","id":2786,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2785,2784,2783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bright Future for Gaucho Volleyball Behind Two Surprise Freshmen Starters","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Two freshmen have impressed immediately for the UCSB women’s volleyball team, contributing in a big way.

The next closest is senior outside hitter Charlene DeHoog with 139. Additionally, Heenan is third on the team with 16 assists.</p>\n<p>“Kelly just has this cool confidence to her when she plays,” senior setter Dana Vargas said. “What makes her so special is that she doesn’t make a lot of mistakes. Coach says she has a good volleyball I.Q.”</p>\n<p>From the first time she set foot on campus, Heenan has felt right at home in Santa Barbara – on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“I love it here,” Heenan said. “Everyone on the team has been really great and it’s been awesome to make an immediate impact.”</p>\n<p>Success is nothing new for the 5’8” defensive specialist from Costa Mesa. Heenan’s list of high school accolades is not a short one; as a senior at Newport Harbor High School she led her team to a state championship while receiving First team All-Orange County honors and was named a Top-250 preseason All-American.</p>\n<p>“I know how much hard work needs to be put in to be the best,” Heenan said. “The work ethic on this team is unbelievable.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Kara Sherrard has a bit of a different story of her road to the starting outside hitter position. Asked to walk onto the team last year, Sherrard’s chances of starting were bleak.</p>\n<p>“Kara was obviously someone I wanted on the team, but [I] did not expect her to start for us,” Gregory said. “Over summer, she started to get stronger and stronger and to really commit herself to improving.”</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara’s first match of the season on the road against UC Berkeley, sophomore outside hitter Leah Sully tore her ACL, leaving Sherrard as her replacement.</p>\n<p>“It’s always extremely unfortunate when a player is injured, but sometimes when one door closes, another one opens,” Gregory said. “Kara has been great for us.”</p>\n<p>The freshman entered her game and made an immediate impact, blocking a kill attempt on her first play.</p>\n<p>“It’s been unbelievable,” Sherrard said. “I just wanted to come in and play consistently for the team.”</p>\n<p>The 6’0” outside hitter has started every match since then. She ranks 2nd on the team with 340 total attacks her 95 kills are good for 3rd. Sherrard is also 4th on the team with 11 assists and is tied for 3rd with seven service aces.</p>\n<p>“Kara has come in and really stepped up to the plate,” Vargas said. “Her role is to be steady and defend, and she has stepped up to the plate when her number has been called.”</p>\n<p>Sherrard’s toughness may be her most impressive attribute. In a tournament game at the USD Invitational against Minnesota, Sherrard suffered a sprained ankle. Carried off the court, it seemed as if she would not return. However, Gregory put her back into the game in the second half.</p>\n<p>“I really feel like part of the team,” Sherrard said. “It raises my confidence level knowing that Coach has that much confidence in me.”</p>\n<p>Hailing from Lancaster, Sherrard led Quartz Hill High School to consecutive undefeated Golden League seasons. As a senior, she was named the Golden League Player of the Year, and earned First team All-CIF Southern Section honors.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing [about Heenan and Sherrard] is that they believe in themselves and they know our coaches believe in them,” Gregory said.</p>\n<p>The pair of freshman has been doing its best work as of late. In Santa Barbara’s last three games — all wins — both Hennan and Sherrard have been fantastic. In the Gauchos’ 3-2 win over SDSU at the USD Invitational, Heenan set a season-high with 26 digs.</p>\n<p>“My success is really a product of the team’s,” Heenan said. “It’s good to know that all of the players are out there to support one another and lift each other up.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos opened up league play emphatically at the end of August, posting two straight road wins over Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine, before beating Long Beach State to begin Big West play 3-0.</p>\n<p>As has been the case all season, both Heenan and Sherrard impressed. In Santa Barbara’s win over Northridge, Heenan collected a team-high 19 digs, while Sherrard delivered 11 kills to lead UCSB to the hard-fought victory, 3-2.</p>\n<p>Against Irvine, the story was the same. Heenan led Santa Barbara with 16 digs, while Sherrard collected a double-double with 11 kills and 13 digs to help the Gauchos shut out the Anteaters 3-0.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara’s comeback win over Long Beach State, Heenan recorded a team-high 21 digs, while Sherrard posted another double-double with 15 kills and 10 digs.</p>\n<p>“This season has been a little bit surreal so far,” Sherrard said. “I wasn’t expecting to be playing at all this season, so it’s awesome to be helping the team out at all.”</p>\n<p>In the team’s latest victory, the freshman duo stepped up for the Gauchos once again. Sherrard had 16 kills and 14 blocks and Heenan tied for a team-high with 14 digs to lead to Gauchos to victory over Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is now 10-8 overall and 4-1 in Big West league play. UCSB will take to the court next this weekend when it faces Pacific and UC Davis on the road. As vital members of the squad, both Heenan and Sherrard will have to perform if the Gauchos are to continue their early season success.</p>\n<p>“Both of these girls are fantastic players,” Gregory said. “They have been great for us and I only expect them to get better.”</p>\n<p>Heenan, Sherrard and the rest of the squad will face Big West foe Pacific in Stockton on Oct. 15 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-12/bright-future-gaucho-volleyball-surprise-freshmen-starters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-12/bright-future-gaucho-volleyball-surprise-freshmen-starters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-12/bright-future-gaucho-volleyball-surprise-freshmen-starters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-12/bright-future-gaucho-volleyball-surprise-freshmen-starters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-12/bright-future-gaucho-volleyball-surprise-freshmen-starters/","id":2291,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2290,2289,2288],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: To 49ers: You Suck and Here’s Why","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This was supposed to be the year.

With Frank Gore, who has posted four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons as your running back, and Alex freaking Smith as your quarterback, those numbers should be reversed.</p>\n<p>In a quarterback-driven league, Smith, who has three touchdowns and seven interceptions, just doesn’t cut it. Because the Niners have a few offensive weapons like tight end Vernon Davis and wide receiver Michael Crabtree, they believe they can be a versatile offensive team. But nobody can perform if Smith doesn’t step it up. Davis has slowed down considerably after his breakout campaign last year, and Crabtree, who was vastly overvalued heading into this year’s fantasy drafts, has as many touchdowns as Chancellor Yang this season.</p>\n<p>The Singletary train seems to be slowing down considerably. Sure, Singletary was an amazing player and is a master motivator, but his talents as a coach are yet to be seen. Penalties have hindered San Francisco repeatedly this year, and a more structured, schematic coach may fit the squad better. To come back in the division and make a playoff push, Singletary is going to need to motivate and coach.</p>\n<p>It could be that the 49ers are just losing on purpose to get a shot at drafting Stanford’s Andrew Luck. Surely they wouldn’t fuck up again by passing on the local hero, as they did in 2005 when they drafted Smith #1 overall over Cal’s Aaron Rodgers. Ouch. I feel bad for Niner fans just writing that.</p>\n<p>There are few positives for the NFL franchise with the second most Super Bowl victories of all time. We all know linebacker Patrick Willis is an absolute beast. All over the field on every play, Willis looks like he is becoming the next Ray Lewis. Additionally, safety Taylor Mays has been making the most out of his playing time, and is looking like he can be the game-changing athlete he was at USC. That duo could be staples of a solid defense for years to come.</p>\n<p>The best thing going for SF is their weak division. The NFC West is BY FAR the worst division in football. With the non-convincing Arizona, St. Louis and Seattle squads all at 2-2, San Francisco could still easily come back and win the division.</p>\n<p>So to all you 49ers fans in I.V. out there: HAHA. Just kidding. At least the only way to go from here is up…</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/sunday-funday-49ers-suck/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/sunday-funday-49ers-suck/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/sunday-funday-49ers-suck/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/sunday-funday-49ers-suck/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/sunday-funday-49ers-suck/","id":2282,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2281,2280,2279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: “Bitches Love That Surfer Vibe, Bra”","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Dude.

Surfers hail from a broad variety of places and cultures. I have a lot of good things to say about most of the surfers I’ve met in my travels. Then again, I have a lot of bad things to say about a lot of the surfers I’ve met. And most of the latter group come from Southern California and Santa Barbara. The bros in particular.</p>\n<p>However, there is a rare breed of die-hard surfers I’ve met in Santa Barbara, who get things done under the radar, who don’t surf the beach in hopes of glamour, pussy and a beach bod.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you can spot them lurking in the back of a party around midnight, checking NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) before they allow themselves another drink. Sometimes you can hear them in the mornings around 5 a.m., rubbing sleep out of their eyes and wearily dragging their wetsuits and damp towels down I.V. alleys to their surfmobiles. Sometimes you have no idea they exist because they live as mountain men in Los Padres National Forest, well below your glitzed-out radar.  Probably the most noticeable giveaway of a salty sea-vet’s behind-the-scenes surf activities is when you overhear one noting the wind conditions late at night. Or when you’re at their secret spot and they’re threatening to drown your kook ass— you’ll also know then.</p>\n<p>These are the surfers who don’t immediately saunter up and brag about where they surfed or the waves they got that day — instead they are looking forward, always stretching toward more spots, more waves, better designs, increased stoke. What these elites pull from their sessions is the knowledge of the perfect combination of wind, tide, direction and light required to create the ultimate dawn sesh at T’s, ’Con, Lil’ ’Con and certain other areas up and down the coast.</p>\n<p>These aren’t the shaggy-haired blonde boys and girls sitting in front of you in lecture, sporting bright pink Electric shades, obscene blue trunks, sorority rush shirts and surfer-style trucker hats. Not the fools who stain their reps by going for broke all day. (“Hey bra did you see that epic set at Sands yesterday? I like totally busted a rodeo flip over the whole UCSB surf team.”)</p>\n<p>Instead, these are the people accustomed to the chain of maneuvers that settle you into the precarious overhang beneath a slabby tube. They see swell lumping in from the horizon and know precisely how to start the elevator drop down a watery cliff-face into exalted tubedome.</p>\n<p>Surfers thrive in every nook and urine-drenched alley of Isla Vista. They exist in abundance in the state, nation and most of the coastal world.</p>\n<p>The only problem with surf bro-ciety is that there are too many wannabee Jordys out there, but too few Gerry Lopezs. Everyone wants to throw the biggest air all the time — but guess what? — waves are made of water. Try staying in the water for a while before you get any grandiose ideas, big fella.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to be said for the type of person who learns things the hard way — through patience, practice and persistence. And passion, I could add.</p>\n<p>As a side note, there is also that unique breed which owns a house in Montecito, dates 19-year-old models from UCSB and moonlights as a world-champion surfer. How does he do it? Is he human?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Surf Columnist Elliott Rosenfeld will drown your kook ass if you ever suggest that he’s getting laid again.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/","id":2288,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2287,2286,2285],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Regretting Draft Picks?

I know why you did it. I know it’s not your fault. Moss was coming off a season in which he accumulated 13 touchdowns and almost 1,300 yards, all with quarterback Tom Brady still recovering from an ACL tear. It was logical to assume that with a healthy Brady running the offense, Moss would have no problem eclipsing last season’s numbers. Those of you who believed this have been duped.</p>\n<p>So far, Brady’s throwing to anyone but Moss, who has accumulated a total of nine receptions for 139 yards, including a grand total of zero receptions in Monday night’s game against the Miami Dolphins.</p>\n<p>At this point, Moss owners have two options: Bench Moss and hope he turns it around or abandon ship and trade him.</p>\n<p>Trading a high profile player like Moss can be a difficult thing to do, but the longer you wait the less likely you are to get good value for him. I can guarantee you that in your league there is at least one owner in need of a wide receiver, and that same owner may still believe that Moss will turn his season around. If you act now, you may still be able to trade Moss and receive good value for him in return.</p>\n<p>However, most fantasy owners are not stupid. They might call your bluff. To sweeten the deal you might want to add into the mix one of your bench players who could fill a need on their team. The downside of this is that you now are losing two players, but in the end it will be worth it to have a productive player in Moss’s place. This plan can be used to deal with any big name player performing like Moss. Remember, a little trickery every now and then never hurt anyone… except the person being tricked.</p>\n<p>In any case, the second type of headache player is a bit more difficult to deal with. Titan running  back Chris Johnson provides the perfect example. Looking at the record-breaking numbers of Johnson’s 2009 season, his average draft position of 1.4 for this season seems justified. However, despite a couple of good performances, Johnson has been wildly inconsistent, as any fantasy owner unlucky enough to draft him first will tell you. He should not have been drafted one spot ahead of Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who has been much more consistent this season.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you will be able to get good value for Johnson in a trade. He is still one of the best players at his position, and he has the talent to turn his season around. But until he does, you should consider benching him for a more consistent performer, because as it is Johnson is just as likely to hurt you as he is to help you.</p>\n<p>Everyone has their draft day regrets. There is no such thing as a perfect draft because there are just too many factors outside the fantasy owner’s control. No one can account for injuries or unexpected slumps.</p>\n<p>What matters is how you deal with the rotten spots on your roster. If you deal with your underachievers soon enough, you may be able to prevent them from doing irreparable harm to your record.</p>\n<p>Make trades, work the waiver wire, watch for favorable matchups and adjust your lineup to make sure you trust your starting players to perform.</p>\n<p>Lastly, make sure no one tricks you into making a bad trade. It’s all fun and games until someone gets Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: BenJarvus Green-Ellis, RB, New England. Yes, the Patriots are on a bye week, but don’t let that stop you from grabbing Green-Ellis while you still can. So far, he succeeded where Laurence Maroney failed and has somehow convinced Bill Belichick to give him the ball consistently. He is still available in almost 30 percent of ESPN leagues and can provide you with good value at running back.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26904\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26904\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/","id":2287,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2286,2285,2284],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Speace of Mind: Musings on Derek Jeter","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I don’t want it to end, period, but more so, I don’t want it to end in the way I think it is going to. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I don’t want it to end, period, but more so, I don’t want it to end in the way I think it is going to. The question on everyone’s mind in this day and age is, “What have you done for me lately?” signaling a trend toward taking out the old and shipping in the people and things that are younger, faster and newer. Maybe it’s the hidden kleptomaniac in all of us, but we are obsessed with the glitz, the glamour and the overall shine of something new. This is why it might be all too easy for the Yanks to give the old boot to my man, Derek Jeter.</p>\n<p>There is an intense amount of pressure and tension produced by each and every one of those hostile fans who pour in from Yonkers all the way to the Bronx. Jeter can feel it, sense it, touch it; the feeling is palpable. They are quick to embrace and love when everything is going right for a guy, but are even quicker to leave that same guy out in the cold once he nosedives. New Yorkers are definitely not on the level of the average Philly fanatic, where every game determines their mood for the rest of the day, week or even month, mind you. However, they are swift in making judgments, and fall somewhere between the obnoxiously interested middle-American, high-school football fan and the on-and-off Warriors fan.  And being that NY’s pinstriped darlings won the World Series in 2009, fans are on red alert this year, expecting a duplicate performance.</p>\n<p>Duplicating a performance, especially in October, is where Jeter usually comes in. After the record year he enjoyed in 2009, with a .334 batting average, a .406 on-base percentage and a whopping .465 slugging percentage, he has dropped off considerably. Some cite his age; some, his mindset. Dazzling us with his perfect Crest Whitestrip smile and his bronzed, Adonis-like skin since the age of 21, he has found his way into my- or, I mean, our- hearts with his solid play and classy style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, the Jeter we have all come to know, love and respect might be in hibernation mode —forever. His .270 batting average, .340 on-base percentage and .370 slugging percentage are all among the lowest he has logged since his first days in Yankee Stadium. However, with all this being said, I am a firm believer in the age-old adage, “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” Derek (yes, I feel close enough to the man to call him that) is not just another player. Heck, he isn’t just another Yankee. He is THE Yankee. He is an old-school player in the new-school age, ready to seize a moment when it is ready to be taken. This is October, my friends, and he didn’t become Mr. October for sitting around the couch with the Dodgers, Angels and Pirates. This is his time, and he knows it. All Jeter detractors beware, because it is about the time when things get a whole lot better for the World Series champ.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/","id":2290,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2289,2288,2287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: Tar, Seaweed and Finding a Surf Niche","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I used to get a lot of dirty comments about the big bottle of Johnson’s Baby Oil Gel I keep in the shower rack.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I used to get a lot of dirty comments about the big bottle of Johnson’s Baby Oil Gel I keep in the shower rack.

It’s stinky and dirty and somehow can worm its way anywhere inside your wetsuit.</p>\n<p>I once had to scrub my right butt cheek almost raw with pumice to get a particularly dooky-like smear of tar off my skin.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In addition to oozing nasty tar, our little piece of coastline — the beach stretching from Goleta Pier to Coal Oil Point — has a beautiful beach body but an unfortunate case of the kelpies. Like an STD for a beach, I.V. is plagued with massive deposits of kelp.</p>\n<p>The stuff is possessed, I swear it. Like clockwork, every time you’re having a particularly crowded sesh and the wave you’ve been waiting for comes along, you’ll start paddling or try to jump to your feet — only to be thrown backward like a hog-tied animal, constricted by the kelp’s tentacles. More than a few times I could’ve seriously benefitted from carrying a weedwacker in the surf.</p>\n<p>To be fair, most every surf location has its own quirks. Regardless of your talent, you’ll quickly learn things about the local toothed marine animals, rock formations, shallow reefs, troublesome kelp, rough beach accesses, rip tides, river mouths and the multitude of little obstacles particular to different surf locations. However, some beaches are pristine — unmarred by dangerous protuberances or crafty tides. But those are the rare ones.</p>\n<p>For instance, I know that at a certain secretive surf spot underneath the Golden Gate in SF, anyone paddling out during a quickly outgoing tide is sure to be sucked out to sea, to float in absolute fear in the cold, shadowy waters underneath the massive orange bridge.</p>\n<p>I also know that if you visited the Westside in Santa Cruz on a solid swell, the Lane has a dangerous rock bordering the takeoff zone that’ll take a hefty chunk out of your boards, fins or dome if you don’t hop it as you pump the line.</p>\n<p>Sands Beach has a particularly menacing rock — about a quarter of the way to the river mouth, in the inside — that exposes itself on left-breaking waves at low tide and lurks just beneath the surface on a higher tide.</p>\n<p>As surfers, we accumulate a repertoire of water lore that is both essential to our survival and complimentary to our understanding of the elements and the melding of soul with nature. Most of the time, it’s going to take a couple of scrapes and bruises to alert you of certain ocean phenomena in your surf realm.</p>\n<p>Notice I said “your surf realm.” That’s the whole point. By encountering the risks and perks that come with the sport, you craft for yourself a niche in the spiritual, soulful sea, a niche that few understand but most envy.</p>\n<p>So go find your niche. There’s nothing worse than going to the first full week of class without first dousing yourself in tangy brine-water and rubbing tar out of your hair with baby oil, all in quest of that elusive perfect session.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld hopes your surf niche doesn’t get in the way of his.

He also sleepwalks, including one alleged incident in which Vincze woke up to Gronow standing over him.</p>\n<p>“He was in a bear pose, ready to attack,” Vincze said.</p>\n<p>Of the incident, Gronow claims he was awake and thought he was escaping spiders in his bed.</p>\n<p>“I think [my sleepwalking] used to shock him,” Gronow said. “But now he’s used to it.”</p>\n<p>Gronow, Komadinic and the rest of the Gaucho squad are currently preparing for the SoCal Tournament, which will be held at UCLA beginning Oct. 2. There, the team may have another chance to play Stanford, who has beaten UCSB in each of their past three meetings.</p>\n<p>“Our ultimate team goal is a national title,” Gronow said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/","id":2762,"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson"},"related":[2761,2760,2759],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":22,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
