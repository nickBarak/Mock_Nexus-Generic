Their early season struggles last year were the last straw in what had been an extremely tough transition period after Luis Suarez left for Barcelona.</p>\n<p>Five games into the next season, now led by Jürgen Klopp — a genius of high-pressing football and a cultural icon that seems to breathe belief and hope into LFC and it’s fans — and the Reds are flying high. Liverpool is impressing with 13 points (4-1-1) and sitting pretty in fourth, including wins at Arsenal and Chelsea and at home to Leicester; the Premier League is as loaded as it’s ever been with top-four quality sides, Champions League would be a great success for the German in his first full season in charge.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73112\" style=\"width: 415px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73112\" data-attachment-id=\"73112\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/liverpool1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?fit=2500%2C3000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2500,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"liverpool1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?fit=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?fit=853%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73112\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=405%2C486\" alt=\"Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus\" width=\"405\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=768%2C922&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=853%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 853w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73112\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The former Dortmund manager was quick to implement his trademark <em>gegenpress</em> when he joined Liverpool, immediately asking his players to hunt in packs high up to pitch to win back the ball before attacking again with quick, incisive passes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

His lack of depth in the back wasn’t suited to the high-intensity style. His midfield lacked burning pace. His frontline was too thin and Daniel Sturridge suffered from injuries most of the season.</p>\n<p>This summer was the first time Klopp was able to buy and sell players from his squad to real effect — January isn’t the best time for a rebuild by any means — and the German bought perfectly.</p>\n<p>He brought Sadio Mane that gives them a winger that’s proving to be one of the Premier League’s finest players. Before Mane arrived, Liverpool was loaded with creative attacking midfielders in Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana, but lacked someone who could just blow past defenders and run in behind effectively. The purchase of Georginio Wijnaldum from Newcastle also brought balance to the midfield with his top-class workrate and skillful distribution.</p>\n<p>Joël Matip on a free transfer and goalkeeper Loris Karius for under five million pounds could eventually develop the Reds into one of the hardest teams to score on as well. Matip was a first-choice center-back in FC Shalke 04’s side for nearly seven years, and has played in two World Cups for Cameroon despite only being 25 years old. Karius, the 23-year-old new boy from Mainz, was voted by Bundesliga players in a poll by Kicker to be the second best goalkeeper in the league, trailing only worlds’s best, Manuel Neuer.</p>\n<p>Klopp didn’t completely rebuild his squad at all; in fact, he kept every core player from last year’s team, but the additions he made were crucial. Each one was well-considered and filled a recognizable gap in Rodgers’s version of Liverpool.</p>\n<p>The biggest question asked of Liverpool this season has been of their ability, or inability, to kill off games against the Prem’s worst sides, highlighted by their 2-0 loss to Burnley. It must be noted, though, that four of the Reds’ first five games came against Champions-League-caliber teams, and, in all three of their wins, Klopp’s men have simply looked the better team.</p>\n<p>The smiling Jurgen Klopp has put Liverpool back on the tip of people’s tongues by creating a team capable of a burst of goals rivaled only by the world’s superclubs. Combined with the emotion of the Anfield faithful, the revived Reds have already shared what’s to come. Last season’s win against Manchester City and a magical comeback against Dortmund to advance to the Europa League final were just samples of the inevitable glory to come.</p>\n<p>When watching LFC play at home, the German manager has created a bond between players and fans that just oozes confidence and a belief in a club’s project as great as what’s present at Liverpool is almost unrecognizable in modern football. The players trust the coach and the coach trusts the players. The fans shouldn’t expect to win the league, but there’s plenty of reason to hope.</p>\n<p>Klopp brought two legendary Bundesliga titles to Dortmund over the Bavarian giants Bayern Munich, etching his name in football history, but one would be a fool to assume he’s done winning, especially with his team beginning to look as clinical as his title-winning sides this early in the Premier League season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73110\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73110\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/","id":1916,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1915,1914,1913],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NLDS Showdown Set, Giants and Mets Set to Square Off","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mlb-postseason.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mlb-postseason.jpg?resize=599%2C337&ssl=1","description":"Wednesday's NL-wild card game between the San Francisco Giants and New York Mets will be the ultimate matchup in which both teams have the chance to advance and face the Chicago Cubs.

Out of high school, he was selected tenth overall by the San Francisco Giants and has only continued to improve his abilities as a player and a teammate.</p>\n<p>Syndergaard, only having made his debut in May of 2015, has been a firecracker on the field and an enormous asset to his team. Drafted 38th overall by the Toronto Blue Jays, this Texan quickly worked his way to the top leaving a notable trail behind him.</p>\n<p>In 2013, he started for Team USA in the Futures Game and by the end of the year was ranked the 11th-best prospect in baseball by<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>.</em> He performed with outstanding ability in the 2015 World Series as a rookie and became the second- youngest Met to win a World Series game. Although he is newer to the big leagues, Syndergaard has certainly proven his worth, not to mention his knack for strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The winner of this game will advance to the divisional round of the National League playoffs on Friday where they will meet the top seeded Chicago Cubs. During the 2016 season, both Wild Card candidates have been evenly matched with the National League Central team.</p>\n<p>In May, the Giants defeated the Cubs two games to one, yet in September San Francisco lost at home in a four-game series, losing the set 3-1.</p>\n<p>Alternately, in early July the Mets swept the Cubs when playing on their own turf, but lost the three game set at Wrigley Field, 2-1.</p>\n<p>This year’s potential World Series candidates are at their strongest and working their hardest. While a majority of the 2016 Major League Baseball Season has been exciting, nothing compares to the intensity of postseason play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/","id":3330,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[3329,3328,3327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Hall of Fame Nominees Announced; Top 3 RBs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After the recent release of the NFL Hall of Fame's Class of 2017 nominations, Sports Editor Sean White keys in on the running back position specifically and forms a Top 3 list of ball carriers that sh...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the last few years of NFL football, we have watched the depreciation of the running back position.

Without further ado, here are my selections:</p>\n<p><strong>LaDainian Tomlinson, Chargers/NY Jets, 11 seasons (2001-2011)</strong></p>\n<p>The only other respected “LT” in NFL history alongside Lawrence Taylor, it is inevitable that LaDainian Tomlinson is one of the league’s best backs ever to grace the field.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzqUvuS7e9c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Gifted with all-around talent to juke defenders between the tackles and possessing the strength that helped complement his elusiveness, it was of no surprise when LT set the all-time record for most touchdowns in a single season at 28 in 2006.</p>\n<p>Ranking second all-time in career rushing touchdowns (145) and fifth all-time in both career rushing yards (13,684) and career rushing attempts (3,174), Tomlinson was the pulse of the San Diego Chargers offense for nine seasons. He ranks as the Bolts all-time leader in career rush attempts (2,880), yards (12,490), and touchdowns (138).</p>\n<p><strong>Terrell Davis, Denver Broncos, 8 seasons (1995-2002)</strong></p>\n<p>A career deflated by injury proneness and an extreme knee injury during the 1999 season that marked his drastic decline and eventual retirement in 2002, the legend of Terrell Davis remains a tale of what could have been.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yy-lnbMfhNg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>One of seven running backs in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a single-season and crowned the 1998 NFL MVP after rushing for 2,008 yards and an all-time sixth ranking 21 touchdowns on 392 carries; Davis was destined to etch his name amongst the greatest in the league’s record books but unfortunately was plagued with injuries after putting up some of the best stats by a rusher in his first four years in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Helping lead Denver to back-to-back Super Bowl rings in 1997 and 1998, the Broncos’ all-time career rushing leader accumulated 6,413 rushing yards and 56 rushing touchdowns in his first four seasons.</p>\n<p>Via Kevin Patra of <em>nfl.com</em>, Davis owns the highest career playoff rushing average at 5.59 yards per attempt and is tied with Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith for most playoff 100-yard rushing games at seven but distinguishes himself by completing this feat in seven-straight postseason matchups. Nonetheless, he is one of 12 players in NFL history to win Super Bowl MVP and AP NFL MVP (Patra, <em>nfl.com</em>). While his statistics will forever be admired, the mind will only continue to wonder how Davis’ career would have ultimately ended if healthy.</p>\n<p><strong>Eddie George, Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans/Dallas Cowboys, 9 seasons</strong></p>\n<p>A hardnosed bruiser at 6-3, 235 pounds complemented by his speed and agility to cut in and out of gaps, Eddie George was like a created player in a video game when on the field.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72714\" style=\"width: 452px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72714\" data-attachment-id=\"72714\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/72713/footballhalloffame/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?fit=3000%2C3000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"footballhalloffame\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72714\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=442%2C442\" alt=\"Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus \" width=\"442\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>His impact in the backfield was immediate as he won the 1996 NFL AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award after rushing for 1,368 yards and eight rushing touchdowns off of 335 rushing attempts.

The obvious one, to those native to the crescent city and even to those who aren’t, is the day Hurricane Katrina struck the city on Aug. 23, 2005, and completely destroyed people’s homes, families, livelihoods, and hope.</p>\n<p>Due to the devastating hit the city took from Katrina, about 9,000 people took shelter in the New Orleans Superdome, home to the Saints, who had evacuated beforehand. A place once home to one of the worst franchises in all of sports now became home to people who had been through one of the worst catastrophes imaginable. Even worse, the lack of supplies was so bad many people were left starving and thirsty.</p>\n<p>The state of the Superdome became extremely bad over the next few days due to the breakdown of hygiene, urinals, and plumbing, which left the smell inside the stadium horrible. The outside also went bad as the roof was peeling off and holes were starting to form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Due to the state of the Superdome and the severity of the situation, the 2005 Saints played no home games in the dome and played in Baton Rouge Stadium or the Alamodome. Worst of all, their home opener was rescheduled to a Monday night “home” game against the Giants at The Meadowlands, home of the New York Giants. That’s right: The Saints’ “home opener” was scheduled to be played at their opponents’ home stadium, and there was nothing they could do about it.</p>\n<p>As the 2005 season went on there were various reports that the owner, Tom Benson, and government officials in San Antonio were working behind the scenes concerning a possible permanent relocation for the Saints to San Antonio. The reports said Benson would get out of his contract by saying the Superdome was no longer adequate to house his team.</p>\n<p>Fans were stunned. By this point they were just trying to get back into a normal lifestyle, and now the team they loved was being taken away from them. Make no mistake; although the Saints were a terrible team for many, many years, they were still loved by the city of New Orleans.</p>\n<p>Many fans in Louisiana were angered and felt people in San Antonio were taking advantage of an already desolated city by stealing their franchise. Tensions ran so high that the New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin called Benson’s actions shameful to those who supported the team through about 40 losing seasons.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, once all was said and done, the NFL stated that the Saints would stay in New Orleans and the Superdome would re-open its doors on Sept. 25, 2006, for a Monday night game against the Falcons. Fans were so happy to hear the Saints were staying, that for the first time in franchise history the team sold its entire home schedule to season ticket holders.</p>\n<p>That’s where our second day comes in. The day most embedded into New Orleans culture, whether you are a sports fan or not. The day the crescent city was reborn.</p>\n<p>Very rarely will there be another play that touches the hearts of people not even part of the sports world as much as the blocked punt by Steve Gleason, which was returned for a touchdown after a Falcons three-and-out on their opening drive, now dubbed “Rebirth.” To this day, people swear the Superdome was never as loud as during and after that magical play.</p>\n<p>Those who doubt the importance of one play, especially one such as this, truly do not know the electricity that flowed through the city and their football team thanks to Rebirth. The Saints crushed the Falcons 23-3 that night and went on to have their best season in franchise history, finishing 10-6, clinching a first round bye and reaching their first ever NFC championship game.</p>\n<p>While the Saints’ season in 2006 did not end with a Super Bowl championship, the pieces were set to make a run and eventually win the most coveted game. By comparison, New Orleans as a city was also recovering steadily, but it wasn’t ready to say it was fully back to normal only one year after such a horrible tragedy.</p>\n<p>See, the thing about the Saints and their ties with their city is that as the football team started to become a winner, the crescent city was recovering. It was almost as though the city was lifted through the success of the Saints, which all came to fruition in 2009 when New Orleans was able to see their once loveable losers become champions of the football world.</p>\n<p>Rebirth wasn’t just about a single play in which an athlete made a solid effort. It was not about the players, it was not about the football team and it certainly was not about the touchdown.</p>\n<p>It was about the city coming together and putting its love into a team that was never respected. It was about the beginning of the reshaping that took place as the city moved on from Katrina and the Saints moved on from their horrible past. Both parties were ready to become winners, and now they are.</p>\n<p>When the Saints and Falcons re-took the field 10 years later this past Monday to celebrate the historic event, it really felt like everything had come full circle. Sure, the Saints are not a top team anymore, and, unfortunately, they did lose this past Monday 45-32, but the journey from that night and blocked punt in 2006 until now was truly a spectacle worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>Katrina was one of the worst things that could happen to any city anywhere in the world. It robbed people of many valuable things. But what the Saints and the citizens of New Orleans were able to embody is the ultimate form of resiliency. That’s what makes Rebirth not only special, but certainly worthy of the title given to that blocked punt on that night and worthy of the statue made in its honor.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

With the talent of players such as Jordan Clarkson, D’angelo Russell and their selection of Brandon Ingram with the No. 2 pick in this year’s draft, the Lakers’ next franchise player is no guarantee but could surface in due time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Ingram seemingly poised to become the face of the L.A. franchise, the buzz surrounding the rookie has many convinced that he could eventually carry the torch after potentially being the No. 1 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting and playing in five summer league games, Ingram averaged 12.2 points per game while shooting 41.2 percent from the field and 25 percent from behind the three-point line. He also averaged 4.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game in addition to playing 27.4 minutes per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly summer league play is no true predictor of how a player will pan out in the long run, especially at the young age of 19 years old, but Ingram displayed some glimpses on the court that could lead to him flourishing within the NBA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately for Russell, last year was more of an underwhelming season. In addition to former Head Coach Byron Antom Scott placing Russell in and out of the starting lineup, finding the guard’s role on the team became a little difficult as to whether or not he would play the one or two position while alongside Clarkson in the backcourt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Scott’s coaching scheme seemed to stray away from Russell’s strengths, one can only predict that Walton will be able to conquer the puzzle of Russell and Clarkson after helping coach the NBA’s top backcourt duo in Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Nonetheless, Russell had his spurts in which he showcased his ability to produce when on the court whether scoring or assisting. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72441\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72441\" data-attachment-id=\"72441\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-17/lakers-finalize-training-camp-site-at-ucsb/russell-ice-veins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=800%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,553\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"russell-ice-veins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=800%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72441\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=399%2C276\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of deadspin.com\" width=\"399\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=768%2C531&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of deadspin.com</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, the Lakers must focus on training camp and their task of acclimating free agent additions Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng.

seen very often in sports. You have your occasional Bo Jackson’s that can dominate two sports but most of the time it’s hard enough just to dominate in one, something Gaucho alumna Maggie Hogan can attest to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her career at UCSB, Hogan was primarily known as a swimmer, and a good one at that. Even though she joined the team as a walk-on, Hogan worked hard and became co-captain of the 2001 swim team that ultimately won a Big West Championship, its first title since 1995 at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since graduating from UCSB, Hogan, now 37 years old, has continued competing as an athlete with her biggest achievement coming earlier this year when she qualified to represent the United States in the 2016 Rio Olympics. However, Hogan is not representing the United States women’s swim team, instead, she is representing a sport that is not talked about much and does not even exist in NCAA athletics: the canoe/kayaking team.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

However, Hogan was not even introduced to the sport until 2004 when she was in San Diego to try to make a spot on the U.S.’ surf skiing team for the upcoming Goodwill Games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not being used to this sport and facing tremendous competition, Hogan picked up the sport a lot quicker than anyone could’ve expected and earned a spot on the U.S. national team in 2005. From then on she has been training hard, waiting for her chance to one day represent the U.S. in the Olympic games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a nine-year career and not making the cut in 2008 and 2012, Hogan considered retirement. Instead, she decided to switch coaches and chose Michele Eray, a 2008 Olympian for South Africa. From then on, Hogan continued to work toward her dream, and her hard work paid off as in the 2015 Canoe Sprint World Championships she placed bronze in the K1 1000m, the first medal by a U.S. citizen in the World Championships in 20 years. Not only that, but she was the first American woman ever to receive a medal at said championships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, her work was not done there. In order to qualify as a K1 ( the individual event in Kayaking) athlete, the Philadelphia native would need to be the best not only of the U.S. competitors but the entire Pan American region as well. After winning the National Team Trials 500m, Hogan’s focus shifted to the Pan Am championships where placing first would guarantee her a spot in the Rio Olympics.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72053\" style=\"width: 340px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72053\" data-attachment-id=\"72053\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-swim-captain-makes-olympic-debut-as-kayaker/0430trials9_featured/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=640%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,424\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Maggie Hogan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=640%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72053\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?resize=330%2C219\" alt=\"Courtesy of Maggie Hogan\" width=\"330\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72053\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Maggie Hogan</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she was unable to take first, which went to Canada’s Lisa Bissonnette who edged out a win by .47, Hogan’s second place finish still qualified for the Rio Olympics because Canada had already earned a spot in Rio at the World Championships.</span></p>\n<p>And with that a 12-year journey came to fruition and dreams had finally come true for one Maggie Hogan.

month.</p>\n<p>Her gold medal at the Trials was only a stepping-stone for the Santa Barbara Track Club athlete, though, as Nwaba’s event score of 6494 means she is the sixth-seeded qualifier for the Olympic Finals, per the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), with a fighting chance at the podium.</p>\n<p>The thrill of attaining a goal is certainly not lost on one Nwaba who definitely has her focus but also wants to capture the moment of being at the Olympics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found)

compete and represent my country and being proud to be on this team knowing I made it after trying so hard for four years. I’ve seen all these girls [in the field] before and hopefully I can put up a big score and get on the podium.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be one of two Gauchos competing in the Summer Games, along with UCSB alumna and kayaker <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-swim-captain-makes-olympic-debut-as-kayaker/\">Maggie Hogan</a>. Also traveling with Nwaba will be another familiar face to Gaucho athletics, Josh Priester.</p>\n<p>“I came into college as a hurdler and high jumper, and then Josh Priester, who’s still my coach now,” Nwaba said.  “I came in my sophomore year and he introduced me to the heptathlon, and that’s really what opened up the possibility of competing at the Trials and now the Olympics.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after her graduation, she joined the Santa Barbara Track Club, which was founded by Priester, a former assistant coach for Gaucho track and field. Priester, who specializes in coaching the multi-events (heptathlon and decathlon), now runs one of the premier running clubs in the country, training just down the coast at the Westmont College track.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I’m] proud to be on this team knowing I made it after trying so hard for four years. I’ve seen all these girls [in the field] before and hopefully I can put up a big score and get on the podium. – Barbara Nwaba</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Westmont opened their doors to us, and since it’s NAIA [National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics], the rules aren’t as strict as NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association]. Being in Santa Barbara is like paradise, like, why would I ever want to leave?” Nwaba joked after finishing the last event of the heptathlon in the customary Oregon rain.</p>\n<p>Nwaba has trained with Priester since her time at UCSB, and her growth has been massive. She has improved her personal record by over 500 points since setting the school record in the heptathlon with a score of 5989, remarkable for someone who became a multi-athlete just two years prior.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles native also holds the UCSB record in the 100m hurdles at 13.59, and is among the top 10 Gauchos in virtually every heptathlon event. Her crowning achievement in college, however, was winning the Big West Championship her senior year, a feat that earned her the title of All-American in her final season in blue and gold.</p>\n<p>When asked which win felt better, the Big West Championship or the Olympic Trials, Nwaba laughed.</p>\n<p>“Probably the Olympic Trials, although the Big West title was really exciting at the time,” she said with her ear-to-ear smile, which seemed to be glued to her face from the time she finished the 800m through the medal ceremony, media zone, and press conference, making no effort to hide her elation with the chance to compete at her debut Olympic Games.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72047\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72047\" data-attachment-id=\"72047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=1272%2C848&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1272,848\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72047 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Courtesy of ucsbgauchos.com\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?w=1272&amp;ssl=1 1272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of ucsbgauchos.com</p></div>\n<p>After winning the heptathlon and securing her ticket to Rio, though, Nwaba insists she didn’t know how to react to her triumph until she spotted a familiar face in the stands waiting for her. Her mother, Blessing, traveled from Los Angeles to the Trials without telling her daughter in order to prevent any distractions during the most important meet of Barbara’s life.</p>\n<p>“The happiness kicked in when I took my victory lap and saw my mom in the stands, who I didn’t know was there, and that’s when the waterworks came down. Everyone came up from L.A., my friends, coaches, family,” Nwaba said before pausing for a sigh of relief, joy and anything else she may have been feeling in her victorious moment.“It’s such a blessing.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba will compete in four events Friday, August 12 and the other three the next day, August 13, with her eyes on the podium in Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, over 6000 miles away from the UCSB track, where her heptathlon journey began.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Known for his coaching legacy of 11 championships with the help of NBA greats such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, Jackson is hoping to return a sense of hope to the New York basketball scene at Madison Square Garden.</p>\n<p>Although the suggestion of New York being a “superteam” after its offseason additions by newly acquired former MVP Derrick Rose is far-fetched, the Knicks seem prone to make a postseason return with its roster improvements.</p>\n<p>In addition to receiving Rose, Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick in a trade with the Chicago Bulls for Robin Lopez, Jerian Grant and Jose Calderon, the Knicks most notable additions included Joakim Noah, Courtney Lee and Brandon Jennings within their total of seven signees along with two re-signees.</p>\n<p>While New York has revamped its starting lineup and added a little depth to its bench, its most important move was hiring new Head Coach Jeff Hornacek.</p>\n<p>Possessing a 101-112 overall coaching record after three seasons with the Phoenix Suns, Hornacek presents a refreshing change to the “in-house” approach Jackson has pursued in New York with ties to time spent with the Los Angeles Lakers in the hire of Derrick Fisher and the promotion of interim replacement Kurt Rambis.</p>\n<p>Certainly it will take time for the Knicks’ new talent to mesh together, but it’s the players’ potential to thrive in a system other than the “triangle offense” that Jackson has forced coaches to implement since his arrival.</p>\n<p>Able to return from a knee injury last season, Carmelo Anthony is preparing to enter his 14th NBA season in hopes of making a final push for a championship ring in the tail end of his career.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72012\" style=\"width: 218px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72012\" data-attachment-id=\"72012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/new-york-knicks-vs-portland-trailblazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=1808%2C1205&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,1205\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New York Knicks vs Portland Trailblazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72012\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=208%2C138\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of slamonline.com\" width=\"208\" height=\"138\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of slamonline.com</p></div>\n<p>Just once in Anthony’s career has he advanced further than the first round of the NBA Playoffs, enduring a 4-2 series loss in the 2009 Western Conference Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers while with the Denver Nuggets.</p>\n<p>A ball-dominant volume shooter, it is no question that Anthony will remain the team’s primary offensive scorer. Yet his role will have to adjust a bit as he prepares to play with players such as Rose, a slashing and driving point guard, along with accommodating the growth of Porzingis in his second year.</p>\n<p>With a renovated starting lineup intact, concerns still remain toward New York’s reserves on the bench. Jennings and Lee should be expected to carry the load as Jennings possesses an unpredictable scoring edge and Lee is a decent two-way player.</p>\n<p>With few impactful options available to come off the bench, the Knicks remaining alternatives can be considered a work in progress with players such as Mindaugas Kuzminskas, Maurice Ndour, Marshall Plumlee and Guillermo Hernangomez.</p>\n<p>With no draft pick in this year’s NBA Draft after including its 2016 first-round pick in its trade with the Toronto Raptors for Andrea Bargnani back in 2013, the questionability of New York’s bench only increases as it gets no return after trading away last year’s first-round pick in Grant.</p>\n<p>No, the Knicks aren’t sudden title contenders. Inevitably, the Knicks decline in the past three seasons has resulted in their inability to persuade a superstar free agent to join their team and make them a top contender.</p>\n<p>But this offseason was the most productive pursuit of uplifting the lifeless franchise since the acquisition of Anthony in 2010.

With Hill and Exum receiving most of the playing time at the point, the Jazz will now offer 48 minutes of impactful defense at the spot where they started Raul Neto and Shelvin Mack, mixed with a heavy dosage of Trey Burke, in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>Though Neto and Mack weren’t awful on that end, there’s no doubt that Hill and Exum will be a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Signing Joe Johnson for two years and $22 million is perfect for a young team in need of veteran leadership and shooting, both of which Johnson offers in spades. Some secondary and tertiary play initiation will be helpful for bench-heavy units, and Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors will easily mask his defensive deficiencies at the rim.</p>\n<p>Pair him with Boris Diaw (acquired from the Spurs in a move to clear space), familiar with Gobert from their time on the French national team, and the youthful team has two old heads to navigate the Jazz to a playoff return at relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>The Jazz will struggle to keep up with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the perimeter, there’s no doubt, but dominating the Warriors on the boards and scaring them away from the rim has proved a decent tactic in the past.</p>\n<p>The Warriors kryptonite might be a more switch everything approach, with big guards capable of hounding Durant or Draymond Green in short stretches, or it might not exist at all, but the Jazz have added steady contributors to a roster already fairly well-suited to establish itself among the Western Conference elites, and as the Warriors’ toughest competition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>7 Seconds or Less Comes to Houston</em></strong><em> </em></p>\n<p>The Rockets were a massive disappointment last season after many picked them as the second or third best team in the Western Conference.

Gordon will presumably come off the bench, though it wouldn’t be shocking to see D’Antoni start James Harden as his point guard next season. He’s a better offensive player than Beverley, more versatile and a better shooter, and D’Antoni has proven a strong defensive unit is not his priority.</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has the shooting that both Morey and D’Antoni crave at the power forward position, but back injuries have left his future in question. Anderson earning $21 million in his age 28 season is concerning, as the success of the contract will be totally reliant on his ability to stay healthy. He will open the paint for the Harden, Clint Capela pick-and-roll, a play with deadly potential on a spaced floor.</p>\n<p>The question for both Anderson and Gordon, teammates for the past few seasons in New Orleans, is whether or not they can contribute to a competent defense. The Rockets’ offense should be a joy to watch, but it’s not assured that Houston, juiced up on D’Antoni, will have a defense strong enough to stay much above 500. Harden should lead the team back to the playoffs, but a top-five seed seems like a stretch.</p>\n<p>Capela should be in store for a dominant breakout season; a talented rim runner, he has the perfect skill set to run the type of offense Dwight Howard stalled in his time as a Rocket.

Marks added a lottery ticket at the shooting guard position in Caris LeVert, who showed the ability to score in bunches in his four years at Michigan.</p>\n<p>Though the lower body injuries that cut short his final two seasons are a concern, LeVert shot over 40 percent from three on over four attempts per game from his sophomore season onward.</p>\n<p>That shooting ability was paralleled by improvements in each of his four years in assists per game and assist percentage (an estimate of the number of teammate field goals assisted by a player while on the floor), the latter reaching 33 percent in his final season.</p>\n<p>With Rondae Hollis-Jefferson establishing himself as a defensive menace and an athletic marvel in his rookie campaign, the Nets are in need of someone at either the shooting guard or small forward to make up for his poor offensive game outside the paint.</p>\n<p>Enter LeVert, who should be able to grow with Hollis-Jefferson, cover up his shooting woes and allow the Arizona product to work off-ball cuts to his preferred areas more often as a result of potentially advanced playmaking at both guard positions.</p>\n<p>With the Boston Celtics receiving their first round pick in each of the next two seasons, adding LeVert gave the team another possible young building block.</p>\n<p>Speaking of guards, Sean Marks was able to acquire Jeremy Lin on a steal of a contract at three years, $36 million.</p>\n<p>Possibly eager to reunite with new the Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, a developmental wizard who was an assistant with the Knicks during Lin’s initial breakout, Lin took what seemed below his market value at an average of $12 million per season. Maybe the Nets were the only ones offering a starting job, but getting Lin for the next three years will give the Nets a competent starting point guard who could easily shift to a backup role if need be.</p>\n<p>Lin has shown the ability, both in Los Angeles and in Charlotte last year, to run an excellent pick-and-roll, with the speed to get downhill into the paint quickly and a strong shooting stroke both off the dribble and catch. He isn’t starting for a championship contender, but he fills the biggest hole on the Nets’ roster and gives them a reliable go-to play with a Brook-Lin pick-and-roll that will be difficult to stop in the regular season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71975\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71975\" data-attachment-id=\"71975\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/img25367215/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img25367215\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71975\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?resize=311%2C194\" alt=\"Jeremy Lin averaged 11.7 ppg coming off the bench in Charlotte last season.

Tyler Johnson and Allen Crabbe both received huge paydays with four-year contracts for $50 and $75 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Though both offers were matched by Miami and Portland respectively, the two bloated contracts will limit the future possibilities for both franchises. In Miami, Johnson’s contract will count for just under $6 million against the cap during his first two seasons, before tripling in cost for the final two.</p>\n<p>Though Miami hopes it can hit big on free agency during those first two years, paying Johnson, Whiteside and Goran Dragic close to $70 million in 2019-20 will constrict those desires.</p>\n<p>Crabbe will earn around $18 million per season, slightly more than the recently signed Evan Turner. Crabb is probably best served as a backup shooting guard, playing alongside either Lillard or McCollum while the other rests, though this is a ton of money for that service.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the Blazers have over $45 million invested in two players who harbor sufficient liabilities (defense for Crabbe, lack of outside shooting for Turner) to make both best suited for reserve roles.</p>\n<p>The Blazers hold few options moving forward, and with an extension for CJ McCollum uprising, they will likely be stuck with some iteration of this roster for the foreseeable future. Thanks to Marks’ aggressive moves, the Nets hamstrung two of the more dangerous teams in the league; Portland fresh off an impressive showing against the Warriors, and the Heat who are always a threat for a league-altering splash.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>The Celtics Get Their Man</em></strong></p>\n<p>Boston was finally able to lure a free agent to what has been a malaise of mediocre young talent and promises of a not-so-distant contender. Constantly propped up by the coaching of Brad Stevens, this odd collection of players was able to cobble together 48 wins in 2015-16, but clearly needed more offensive firepower apart from Isaiah Thomas in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Al Horford should perfectly complement this team, and vice versa; Jae Crowder will be an upgrade defensively from anyone who played small forward recently for the Hawks, likewise for Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart as point-of-attack stoppers who far exceed Dennis Schröder and Jeff Teague in that capacity.’</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71976\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71976\" data-attachment-id=\"71976\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71976\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Al Horford started all 82 games last season for the Hawks averaging 15.2 points per game and 7.3 rebounds per game.

Kelly Olynyk and Jonas Jerebko are also far superior three-point shooters to Millsap, offering Horford more space to operate during their shared time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the draft, the team reached for Jaylen Brown, impressed with his athleticism, ability to drive to the rim and seemingly high character. Though Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn and even Jamal Murray offered a higher floor than Brown, who held some of the worst statistical translations for such a high pick in recent history (Kevin Pelton), none shared Brown’s hydra-like ceiling on the wing, able to tenaciously defend four positions and get to the rack at will.</p>\n<p>The Cal product certainly struggles to fulfill that potential, however, as defensively his body is far more NBA-ready than his mind, and on the offensive end, his impressive drives end with missed lay-ups more often than made ones, and his passing ability is inconsistent. The flashes of a great player are there, and the Celtics are certainly a team with the flexibility to bring him along slowly, but it’s not difficult to see his career being a substantial disappointment.</p>\n<p>Ainge spent his next-to-first rounders on Guerschon Yabusele, a 20-year-old power forward from France who looked like an absolute tank in summer league and may come over this season, and Ante Zizic, a 19-year-old Croation center with vociferous energy who will stay abroad for at least one more year. Yabusele offers physicality and playmaking in a 270-pound package, and though he’ll require a ton of coaching on defense, it’s easy to picture him making a contribution in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The young supporting cast is perfect for Horford, as his post-30 career will be aided by a roster that mostly shares a positive age curve. Boston is still in need of another star, and for either Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown or one of the other draftees to show some serious juice.</p>\n<p>In an offseason where Celtics established themselves in the wrung below the Cavaliers out East, however, the move is a welcomed development for a franchise that was treading water, and can now consider itself a conference finals contender.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71968\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71968\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/","id":3320,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3319,3318,3317],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Farewell to the Big Fundamental","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/duncan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/duncan.jpg?resize=920%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tim Duncan's decision to retire has the entire NBA world and assistant sports editor Jorge Mercado reminiscing over the great career of the big fundamental.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=606%2C126\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"606\" height=\"126\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most commonly used lines in sports, and in life, is that Father Time is undefeated.

We all know the greatness of Duncan. We know about the five rings, three Finals MVPs, 15 all-star appearances, two league MVP awards and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of such a decorated and honored career most people, including myself, can also come to the conclusion that Duncan is the greatest power forward to ever live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He was the star of a team that, for 19 years, displayed constant greatness year in and year out. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spurs never missed a playoff series during his 19-year career and have maintained a winning percentage never less than .610. Duncan is also only one of two players in NBA history to win an NBA title in three different decades (the ’90s, ’00s, ’10s).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Duncan a true superstar is the fact that he never acted like or was treated like one. He never caused controversy — except for when it came to his disdain over his favorite referee, Joey Crawford — and never wanted to be in the spotlight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duncan wasn’t “sexy” like these other superstars. I mean, seriously, what’s sexy about the nickname “The Big Fundamental.” It’s no “King James” and it certainly is no “Black Mamba,” but it’s representative of him, and that’s what makes it special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was only one thing he cared about: winning. And in this day and age in which loyalty has become overrated and players are constantly seeking a bigger market to expand their brand, it’s refreshing to know that there was a player who truly looked beyond superficiality and simply wanted to play the sport he loves with his beloved teammates, coaches, and city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Kobe Bryant had to make his exit from the NBA known to the world by jacking up 50 shots and scoring 60 points — that’s why we love you, Kobe — it was fitting that Duncan’s way of leaving was to make a quiet exit toward stage right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Clipper fan, I know Duncan will always have a special place in my heart, seeing as how he constantly used to rip it out in the pre-Chris Paul days. From 2003-2010, the Spurs and The Big Fundamental beat the Clippers in 26 of 27 match-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ups including an 18-game winning streak from 2006-2010.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard being a Clipper fan — trust me, I can attest — but it’s only made harder when there’s one team and one guy in particular who continually beat your team quite handily.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71892\" style=\"width: 287px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71892\" data-attachment-id=\"71892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-12/farewell-to-a-big-fundamental/29906170001_3624585928001_screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"539,374\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=277%2C192\" alt=\"Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of Associated Press\" width=\"277\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?w=539&amp;ssl=1 539w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of <em>Associated Press</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why when the Clippers beat the Spurs in that playoff series in 2015 and Chris Paul made that game-winning shot in game seven over Duncan, my life as an NBA fan was, in a way, complete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know it’s not the same as winning a championship — and believe me, the next round is still painful to talk about to this day — but finally seeing the team I love to get over the hump against the team I despised most was truly satisfying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My hate for Duncan was simply out of respect for the man and his craft. I hated that he wasn’t a Clipper, winning all those games and championships for us, but I loved the man he was on the court and respected the man off of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching Duncan lose that series against the Clippers was like seeing my favorite cartoon hero defeat his enemy for the first time. And yet, watching Duncan retire is like watching the final episode of that cartoon; it really feels like my childhood is over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess that’s why No. 21’s decision to retire really gets me at an emotional level. But as the other constantly heard cliché goes, all good things must come to an end. Just like every great player that has walked away from the game during my lifetime, I’ll get over it. But I’ll never forget the greatness that is known as Tim Duncan aka the Big Fundamental.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks for the memories, Tim, and I can’t wait to watch that Hall of Fame induction speech in 2021.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Really, I am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those people had to suffer through 52 years of brutal heartache and 147 seasons played in professional baseball, basketball, football and even hockey since winning their last title. Hell, the last time they won a trophy was when the Browns took the victory in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, two years before it became known as the Super Bowl. It was about time they have something to celebrate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And celebrate they have, after the Cavs, led by superstar LeBron James, won their first NBA title in NBA history. Riots in the streets; fights breaking out; people jumping up and down on cars, hanging on streetlights and lampposts, breaking bar windows, climbing responding fire engines and ambulances, stealing road signs and traffic cones, etc. etc. A lifetime of anguish for many Clevelanders was let loose in one night in a fit of terror on their own city. But, hey, they needed this.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a San Diego sports fan, I can relate.

Neither has won their current league’s title, with the Padres only appearing in the World Series twice, while the Chargers have appeared in only one Super Bowl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Padres made it to the World Series in 1984 and 1998 and got destroyed both times. In their first appearance against Detroit, the Padres stood no chance, losing the series 4-1. Their second time around they did even worse as they were swept by the Yankees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers one appearance in the Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger was an absolute blowout as Steve Young, who threw for 325 and a still-NFL-record six touchdown passes, and the 49ers cruised to an easy 49-26 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three of these championship appearances are from either before I was born or at least before I can remember. But the strongest memories I do have about the two teams I’ve loved my whole life involve similar heartache in which I witness them get close to a chance at a title and then watch that opportunity wash away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most striking and lasting impression I have of my Chargers is from the 2006 season, when the team finished with the best record in the NFL at 14-2. They were the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and primed for Super Bowl contention led by stars such as Philip Rivers and Ladainian Tomlinson and looks forward to home field advantage secured throughout the playoffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite all the hype and excitement, they then collapsed in their first game of the postseason. A startling 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots in which they committed four turnovers, three of which led to Patriots scoring drives. Despite outgaining their opponent in rushing yards and total yards as well as intercepting opposing quarterback Tom Brady three times, the Chargers’ season was cut short in catastrophic fashion.</span></p>\n<p>Not to be outdone by their football counterpart, the Padres had a heartbreaking season of their own in 2010, a year in which they were predicted to finish last in the NL West but shocked the sports world by holding strong atop the division for most of the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71846\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71846\" data-attachment-id=\"71846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/san-diego-padres-ballpark/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"645,340\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"san diego padres ballpark\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71846\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?resize=365%2C192\" alt=\"Petco Park, the home of the San Diego Padres who have two world series appearances, both losses, in team history.

It would take a monumental collapse for the Padres to blow a chance at the postseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And that is exactly what happened. The Padres proceeded to lose ten straight games into the month of September, a historic collapse that left them clinging to the top of the division by a thread.</p>\n<p>After leading the NL West for 148 days of the season, the Padres officially relinquished a playoff spot for good to the Giants with a loss on the very last day of the season. San Francisco went on to win the World Series while the Padres went home and haven’t had a winning season since.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these finishes left me reeling from a combination of grief and rage that lasted intensely for a minimum of weeks and then slowly worked into my overall emotional impression of San Diego pro sports. It’s memories like these that have left me cynical and demoralized regarding the topic, but not without hope.</span></p>\n<p>No, never without hope. The hope is what keeps me alive. Every new season without fail brings fresh dreams that maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that everything changes. Maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that America’s finest city captures its first-ever modern pro sports title.</p>\n<p>2016 probably isn’t that year. Seeing as the 2015-16 NFL season already concluded with the Chargers well out of playoff contention and the 2016 MLB season is about halfway done with the Padres mired in a sixth straight losing season, the title drought is almost assuredly extending to an extraordinary 54 years.=</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, hey, if Cleveland can finally get theirs, maybe our time is coming soon, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or maybe not.</span></p>\n<p>Just give me one before I die, San Diego.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years later, the United States remains somewhat of a laughing stock in the footballing world, struggling to impose their style of play on games against teams that are clearly superior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the national team’s most visible struggle under Klinsmann, and something that continued in its three losses to Colombia and Argentina in the Copa América.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After exiting the Copa at the semifinals in a pretty embarrassing display against Argentina — the U.S. didn’t even get off a shot in the match, resulting in a 4-0 loss — now is as good a time as any to reconsider the future of the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the weeks leading up to the tournament, the manager’s job was coming under question with the expectation that Klinsmann would likely be relieved of his duties should he prove unable to lead his players through a deep run at the cup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quite a bit of it is always results. We take time after every major competition to reflect on that competition and what led up to it. It’s not a single game, or a single result. It’s where the program is and how comfortable we feel in the direction that it’s going,” Gulati said to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ussoccer.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after hiring the German.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This pragmatic approach is a perfect system of reevaluation for the president of a national FA. If the head of U.S. soccer still holds these beliefs, then he needs to really contemplate whether or not Klinsmann is the man to truly evolve not only the on-field results of the national team, but the general view of the sport in a country that’s just now starting to latch onto the beautiful game as a national passion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klinsmann has surely brought more stability to the national team setup, consistently selecting the same core players since he took over as boss, including German-American recruits John Brooks, Jermaine Jones and Fabian Johnson, all players that have proven themselves as some of the most talented athletes to represent the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistency and stability over time, though, fade into redundancy, and Klinsmann has failed to improve results in his five-year tenure. If Gulati honestly surveys the competition at the U.S.’s last two major tournaments, a semifinal appearance in the Copa América is almost less impressive than advancing from the 2014 World Cup’s “group of death.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, in the two years between the tournaments, there has been little to no improvement in the team’s roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where is Julian Green, who in one of his only chances with the national team scored a brilliant volley on Belgium’s Thibaut Courtois? Where is Juan Agudelo, who, last year against Mexico showcased technical ability on a level that is nowhere to be found in Klinsmann’s current “preferred” side?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the biggest question of all: Where in the world was young starlet Christian Pulisic at the Copa América, who was given all but a half hour on the field throughout the entire tournament?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let it be known that zero other Americans have the quality to make the first team at Borrusia Dortmund, and Pulisic is much more than a part player in Thomas Tuchel’s squad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 17-year-old was eased into the team with substitute appearances in the Bundesliga, but over the course of the season, solidified his role as an impact sub coming in on the wing for the German league runners-up, even grabbing a couple goals in key matches during his team’s title race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The argument that Pulisic couldn’t fit into the starting lineup for the U.S. is absurd; when a player has the pace, ability to take on defenders and talent to pick out a pass in the attacking third for one of Europe’s finest clubs, he has the quality to start every game for the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s most shocking about how Klinsmann handled Pulisic’s first major exposure to the senior national team, though, is how he seemed to tiptoe around the subject in press conferences, as if he was afraid of Pulisic gaining too much fandom so early in his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America undoubtedly has struggled with overhyping under-talented players, namely Freddy Adu, but when a young man shows the promise of becoming a truly world-class footballer, playing time never hinders growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Klinsmann opted for more established players such as Gyasi Zardes, Michael Bradley and Kyle Beckerman against Argentina showed a lack of boldness when facing Messi and co. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting back and defending was never going to beat the top-ranked South American country, but still, Klinsmann was afraid of making a change that may yield criticism upon failure, almost like he was trying his best to save his job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he was hired as the new manager of a long-term project like the U.S. men’s team in 2011, he promised an injection of youth, but six of the starters versus Argentina were 30 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. soccer has stagnated, and Klinsmann is to blame as much as anyone. With the next World Cup in two years, now would be the perfect time for Gulati to cut his losses with the German and hire a new, more daring coach who offers a higher ceiling for the national team as it fights through qualifying for Russia.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/","id":1929,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1928,1927,1926],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
