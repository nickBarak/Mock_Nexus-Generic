\r\n</script> \n<p>Each celebratory scenario serves as a microcosm of the array of past and current African-American MLB players who have contributed to baseball becoming more inclusive and diverse.</p>\n<p>Although widely known for their legacies left on the baseball field, each of the aforementioned former black MLB players were integral influences in black communities nationwide, helping pave the way for African Americans and people of color both on and off the field by confirming that they belonged within “America’s game.”</p>\n<p>This season’s opening day rosters and disabled lists included a league-wide 8 percent of African American players, accounting for a total of 69 black players (via Bob Nightengale, <em>USA Today Sports</em>).</p>\n<p>Helping carry the torch within today’s cohort of black MLB players is Baltimore Orioles All-star center fielder Adam Jones, who has been known to use his social platform to express his thoughts on racial and social injustices.</p>\n<p>For instance, he stated that “baseball is a white man’s sport,” when referring to the MLB’s lack of support during ex-San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the national anthem this past NFL season.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Jones shared his distraught emotions concerning the taunting of racial slurs, which he experienced when he was called the “n-word” and had a bag of peanuts thrown at him in game one of the Orioles-Red Sox series at Fenway Park.</p>\n<p>Since then, various apologies were issued to Jones by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the Boston Red Sox organization and others in attempt to reduce the uproar caused by the select Boston fans who attacked Jones Monday night.</p>\n<p>The incident has ignited much speculation regarding the debate as to whether or not all cities are racist or if it is just certain citizens who hold discriminatory and unjust perceptions of minorities.</p>\n<p>Yet rather than seek a solution to this question, the biggest concern is how citizens, fans, the media and players will rationalize the hatred spewed toward Jones.</p>\n<p>The individuals responsible for their ill-advised behavior will rightly face consequences, but the issue at stake goes beyond just placing the blame upon a few “ignorant” or “uneducated” people.</p>\n<p>Jones’s experience was a reminder of the systemic racism that remains ingrained within society, impacting the sports realm as well.</p>\n<p>People critique this institutional structure and question, for example, “Well, if institutionalized racism exists, then why have these players been able to achieve such success and make it to the MLB?”</p>\n<p>That’s just the masking of the root issue at hand. Whether in society, sports, housing, education, jobs or any other industry, institutional racism must be acknowledged. A mutual understanding must be reached regarding the fact that there’s no single, concrete solution to a system that includes centuries of oppression.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, progress in sport has been made since the breaking of the color barrier, but that feat alone was and still is not the final verdict to racism in sports.</p>\n<p>The possibility to combat its systemic presence is plausible and is a work in progress. Both Boston fans and the Red Sox organization deserve credit for applauding Jones in his first at-bat appearance in Tuesday night’s game, while news surfaced on Wednesday that a fan was banned from Fenway Park for using a racial slur against another fan during Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>Understanding that this week’s incident won’t be the last of a minority athlete being racially discriminated against is frustrating and somewhat numbing as it is expected. However, it is important for each of us to keep the goal of achieving social justice at the forefront of our societal priorities.</p>\n<p>It begins with each of us individually, yet it evolves when combined with the influence of sports.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77591\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77591\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/","id":1886,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1885,1884,1883],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Beyond the Shore: Taylor Helps Lead Best Buddies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Taylor Shore has other best buddies beside her beloved sport of water polo.

It’s really fun and pretty easygoing, which is good for me especially because balancing school and water polo isn’t the easiest thing to do.”</p>\n<p>In the past, the club has gone to other places away from the campus, but this year they have tried to switch it up a little. No matter where they arrange these events, the connections are still refined.</p>\n<p>“I’ve made a lot of friends in the club and also with the individuals with disabilities, I feel like I developed some strong relationships with them too,” Shore said.<br>\nA four-year member now, Shore has been the vice president this past school year in which she displays her leadership skills that she brings out every day in practice at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>“There’s a leadership aspect to [Best Buddies],” Shore said. “We have to coordinate with the board and things like that, so stepping up and doing different tasks is kind of similar as my role as captain.”</p>\n<p>Everyone’s aware of the wide range of life lessons that sports provide, but not everyone knows what it’s like to make a difference in the lives of individuals who are less fortunate.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really humbling experience and it shows you there’s more to the world than just water polo,” Shore said. “I’ve dedicated my life to water polo these past however many years, but it’s nice to get involved in other things and meet other people. It’s fun to be involved and make a difference in other people’s lives.”</p>\n<p>Complementing the Corona, the California native’s ability to collaborate and lead others was also influenced by her role in dealing with essentially a fresh team. Yet, she withstood the process of instilling the culture amongst a pool of many newcomers.</p>\n<p>This process occurred over the course of the entire season, whether it was just setting up the pool or going up against top-notch talent.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t turn out how we wanted it to which is kind of a bummer, but I just try to remind myself of the journey,” Shore said.</p>\n<p>Taylor Shore’s water polo journey began when she was just nine years old. She was almost destined to play the sport considering her family’s history with it.</p>\n<p>“My dad played [water polo] when he was younger and my mom swam, so aquatics have been in my family for the longest time,” Shore said. “Both my brothers played [water polo] and I have cousins and uncles that coach, so it’s a big part of my family.”</p>\n<p>Water polo was love at first sight for the crafty do-it-all Gaucho. Her admiration and dedication helped her achieve the goal of playing in college.</p>\n<p>“I just remember day one falling in love with [water polo], and I’ve always been passionate about it,” Shore said. “Playing in college was always something I wanted to do; it was one of my goals for a really long time.”</p>\n<p>Shore brought her competitiveness that she learned from growing up with her two brothers to UCSB where she excelled.</p>\n<p>Even with the prominent role of captaining a young team on her shoulders, the team captain didn’t sink.</p>\n<p>In her final season, Shore also led the team in points, steals and earned ejections. UCSB was 8-0 this year in games where Shore scored a hat trick.</p>\n<p>While her days of scoring in a UCSB cap and suit uniform have come to an end, Shore’s philanthropic endeavors do not end as her collegiate career prepares to conclude.</p>\n<p>Shore’s passion for helping people with developmental and intellectual disabilities will not stop here.</p>\n<p>“I got a job recently at a place called PathPoint,” Shore said. “What we do there is kind of similar but a little different. I would work with adults with disabilities and help them develop life skills or find jobs or teach them how to pay their bills and things like that. I‘m going to do that over summer.”</p>\n<p>However, she still isn’t done with water polo. After working over the summer, Shore plans on testing the professional waters overseas.</p>\n<p>“Come the end of September, I want to go play abroad because I don’t think I’m ready to be done with water polo yet, so I want to go play in Spain for nine months and then come back,” Shore said.</p>\n<p>Very few players in UCSB women’s water polo history can match up with the career thatShore put together.</p>\n<p>From winning the program’s first-ever Big West Tournament championship to leading a young group of players a year later, Shore has been a role model while laying the groundwork for the future of UCSB women’s water polo.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

All that and the draft doesn’t even really improve parity of a league that has seen many of the same teams make the playoffs year in and year out.</p>\n<p>Under the rules of the NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement, rookies are the best deals in the league. That’s because their contracts are constrained by the rookie wage scale, which keeps their first-year salaries artificially low so teams could get a great investment.</p>\n<p>Per the terms of the CBA, each team has a rookie pool it can spend on its draft picks, with the size of the pool descending as the picks get lower. Spotrac estimates that the Browns will only be able to offer the first overall pick a contract worth a total of $30 million over four years.</p>\n<p>That’s a whole lot less compared to former first overall pick Sam Bradford’s $76 million contract given to him by the then St. Louis Rams after drafting him in 2010, which is, understandably, upsetting to this year’s pick (Myles Garrett, if the Browns are smart) since he would earn probably double without the rookie wage scale.</p>\n<p>In fact, the rookie wage scale only exists because teams went overboard with their rookie deals prior to its implementation, such as in the case of Bradford, who only spent four years in St. Louis throwing for only 11,065 yards, 59 touchdowns and 38 interceptions for a very average 80.1 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>This wage scale makes it so that rookies are the most cost-effective commodities in the NFL. Oakland Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack, for instance, who won the Defensive Player of the Year award last season, is still on his rookie deal, a four-year contract worth $18 million, per Spotrac. Von Miller, the player Mack beat out for DPOY last season, currently has a six-year $114.5 million contract. In 2017, Mack provided the Raiders with Von Miller-level production for just 15 percent of the price.</p>\n<p>No wonder teams like the Browns choose to tank. Only through the draft can teams find elite talent that costs as much as a middling veteran.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the draft system, NFL teams have a strong incentive to tank in order to secure a high pick. In my mind, any system that encourages losing is a broken system that requires major reformation.</p>\n<p>That reformation doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, it’s as easy as simply making incoming players free agents and creating a set rookie-free agency period.</p>\n<p>This change would wipe out any incentive to lose and would allow all teams to compete to sign the best rookie talents. There would be no rookie wage scale to artificially depress the wages of players like Khalil Mack and players would at last have the ability to choose where they want to start their careers.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the new rookie system would work like college recruiting. Teams, starting with the opening of the rookie-signing period, would work to court the top rookies of each class with fat contracts and promises of playing time, and each player would be able to choose from a variety of suitors.</p>\n<p>The existing salary cap would still be in place to act as a restriction on any one team’s ambitions during the rookie free-agency period.<br>\nSure, the Cowboys might be able to attract more rookie interest than other teams, but they’d only be able to sign as many top rookies as they could fit under the salary cap.</p>\n<p>Bad teams like the Browns would still have somewhat of an advantage in the new order, given their large amounts of cap space. All that space would come in handy when competing for the top rookies. Myles Garrett might love Texas, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to turn down additional tens of millions of dollars the Browns or 49ers can offer him.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the new rookie system would prioritize and reward smart teams.</p>\n<p>There are undervalued gems like Julian Edelman and Antonio Brown in every draft, players who in the new system would be available for cheap. While the Cowboys might go around pulling in one or two big names with big deals, other teams could snap up lots of these low-cost, high-value players. It’s what the Patriots and Steelers have been doing for years.</p>\n<p>Shifting from a draft to a rookie free-agency period would be a massive, but necessary, shift. It’s high time that the NFL and the NFLPA give rookies some actual power upon entering the league.</p>\n<p>Abolishing the draft would do that while simultaneously eliminating losing incentives in the NFL. That’s a win-win, and it won’t come at the cost of the NFL’s treasured parity.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

hosted and dropped two out of three games this last weekend to an impressive San Diego State Aztecs team,UCSB junior second baseman Colton Burns believes he understands what has motivated the Aztecs to turn it around this year.</p>\n<p>A former high school and junior college teammate of Burns, junior SDSU outfielder Chad Bible was set to start his first full Division I collegiate season, but on January 10, 2017, just before the season got under way, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“We had this weekend circled on our calendars to play against each other for the first time,” Burns said. “You would never wish the timing of something like that to happen to anybody, but it fires me up to see that the guys over there have rallied around him so well this season.”</p><!--Ad

the junior college level. But even during that impressive season, he says, he could tell something was wrong.</p>\n<p>“I woke up one day last May and had this lump in my neck,” Bible said. “The doctor said it was normal for kids my age to get inflammation there sometimes, so because of that and the way I was playing, I just never thought anything of it.”</p>\n<p>However, more lumps would appear throughout the summer as he geared up to transfer from College of the Canyons to SDSU for the fall semester. Bible even admits that his girlfriend grew annoyed with him during the summer because all he wanted to do was sleep after games.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad, Mike, also stated that he always had concerns, adding, “It just never felt right to me from the beginning, and it wasn’t until the third or fourth check-up where they said, ‘I think it’s a waste of your time to get another scan’ that I started to believe it was nothing to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, Bible told a trainer at SDSU, who referred him to the team doctor. Other tests were done, leading to the biopsy in December of 2016.</p>\n<p>Then came the news that he had cancer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77364\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77364\" data-attachment-id=\"77364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"San Diego State Athlete Headshots\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77364\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug-683x1024.jpg?resize=280%2C420\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>“I didn’t really hear anything after the doctor said ‘cancer,’” Bible said. “But after they went into detail that I would have to drop out of school, quit playing baseball and move home for treatment, all I asked was that we started treatment the day after playing Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>After getting the reluctant “okay” from the doctor, Bible said, “That was so huge for me to be able to do that and to not see all this work I’ve put in over the years go to waste.”</p>\n<p>Getting a chance to play Fullerton was another contest circled on Bible’s calendar from a long time ago because it was the university that he attended out of high school. He redshirted his freshman year there, then transferred to College of the Canyons, before finally landing himself at SDSU.</p>\n<p>When looking back on it, Bible uses humor to downplay the situation.</p>\n<p>“I got along great with those guys at Fullerton, and I’ve never been a cancer in the clubhouse,” he joked. “But for whatever reason, the coach and I there just never saw eye to eye.”</p>\n<p>Through the first five games of the season, Bible batted clean-up for the Aztecs, eager to prove to himself and his former Fullerton coach that he could play at the Division 1 level.</p>\n<p>On February 22, 2017, Bible went 2-for-4 in a Wednesday night matchup versus the Fullerton Titans, which would improve and conclude his batting average at .318 for the season, as he would begin treatment the next morning.</p>\n<p>With each ensuing inning, things grew more emotional at Fullerton, though few in attendance knew it. Each time Bible stepped up to the plate, his family could be seen taking pictures of each at-bat behind the SDSU dugout, wiping away tears in the process.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs went on to earn a 5-4 victory that night following a save by SDSU closer CJ Saylor, who gave the game ball to Bible.</p>\n<p>Knowing he would be making his way to start his first round of chemotherapy at the City of Hope in Los Angeles just five hours later, Bible received a hug from each of the Fullerton players in line for handshakes. Some he knew and many he did not, but all were deeply moved by his story.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad recalls the moment as the most emotional one of his life.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t about the logo on your hat or the colors on your uniform that night,” he said. “It was just a bunch of dudes showing love and respect for something bigger than baseball.”</p>\n<p>Bible stated that the prognosis for him is great, adding that the survival rate is 90 to 95 percent. He has already gone through three rounds of treatment with five more scheduled every other week through the month of June.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77365\" style=\"width: 446px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77365\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77365\" data-attachment-id=\"77365\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bible500\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77365\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500-1024x683.jpg?resize=436%2C290\" alt=\"\" width=\"436\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>He says that he has developed hope from athletes who have walked in his shoes before, such as current Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and pitcher Jon Lester. Both players were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma during their careers and made full recoveries after their treatment. In fact, Lester was so moved by Bible’s story that he reached out via text during his treatment.</p>\n<p>“I just want to be an inspiration like those guys,” Bible said. “I mean, people can feel bad, and that’s all fine and dandy. But what I really want is for people to see me smiling, fighting cancer or playing baseball and ask themselves, like, ‘Wow, what’s my excuse?’”</p>\n<p>Before the Aztecs began accumulating a 29-12 record this season, a major turnaround from last year’s disappointing 21-win season, SDSU pitcher Dominic Purpura came up with a way to pay tribute to Bible throughout the season in a form inspired by their offseason Navy S.E.A.L. training in Coronado.</p>\n<p>Purpura had dog tags made for both the players and coaches, who each received two tags. One tag is personalized with the person’s name, while the other tag reads as follows:</p>\n<p>“San Diego State Baseball 2017”</p>\n<p>“Family Forever”</p>\n<p>“TG19 DTR,” in honor of the former head coach Tony Gwynn, who passed away, and his slogan “Do things right.”</p>\n<p>And below is a nod to Bible, with his initials and number.</p>\n<p>“Fearless CMB23”</p>\n<p>“To be honest, I just started crying,” Bible said. “It meant so much to know that this fight that I am going through is not all for waste, and I couldn’t thank Dom enough for that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/","id":1884,"author":{"id":313,"name":"Austin Cole"},"related":[1883,1882,1881],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Meta Mock Draft: 2017 First-Round NFL Draft Broken Down","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nfldraft2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nfldraft2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff Writer Richard Benites randomly selected the mock drafts of 25 of today’s top sports world analysts and isolated their popular majority per player and per draft pick.

Whether you agree or disagree with that particular writer’s estimate, your next move would probably be to wait for an updated version or to look through a different mock draft altogether. Well look no further: Not only will we give you the most in-depth mock draft, but we’ll do so with science, too (yes, science).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, we’ll be working with the science behind a meta-analysis. This form of statistical analysis combines the results of multiple scientific (or, in this case, mock draft) studies in order to find a conceptually common truth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confused? To simplify, we randomly selected the mock drafts of 25 of today’s top sports world analysts and isolated their popular majority per player and per draft pick.

With a remarkable total of 31 sacks and 47 tackles for loss in his three-year career as an Aggie, scouts are raving about this future rookie with all-pro potential. Just to add more fuel to the fire, Garrett, at 6’5” and 271 lbs, ran a 4.62 time in the 40-yard dash at his pro day. At this point, it’d be foolish for the Browns to pass up on such a franchise talent.       </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 2 San Francisco 49ers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With player comparisons to Brandon Graham, or even “a smaller J.J. Watt,” Solomon Thomas caught many scouts’ eyes during his two-year stint at Stanford. Following an impressive combine performance, we saw Thomas’s draft stock rise and rise. Now with, new 49ers general manager John Lynch at the helm, he’ll make sure to play it safe with his inaugural first-round pick and pick the next-best player after Garrett.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 3 Chicago Bears:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Allen, DE, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winner of the 2016 Bronco Nagurski Trophy for best college defensive player in the nation, Jonathan Allen had quite the outstanding campaign during his four years at Alabama. With 152 total tackles and 28 sacks, Allen has the stats and durability to prove that he’s NFL-ready. The Bears could look to bolster either their defensive line or secondary here. One thing is for sure, Chicago’s defense could really use a first-round game changer.    </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 4 Jacksonville Jaguars:</b></p>\n<p><b>Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before starting with Leonard Fournette, we urge you to please look up some of his highlights. At 6’1” and 228 lbs, he possesses the ability to escape the line of scrimmage and the strength to break the tackle. Fournette’s play style has been appropriately compared to that of Ezekiel Elliott’s, and he is arguably the best offensive player in the entire draft. This LSU halfback has what it takes to be a week-one starter in Jacksonville and may very well be the spark needed to get the Jaguars’ offense going.         </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 5 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 2016 college football season, Ohio State’s Marshon Lattimore allowed an average NFL passer rating of 30.2 whenever he covered the throw. Do you know what the NFL passer rating is for spiking the ball into the ground on every play? It’s 39.6. Yeah, you don’t need to be a statistician to realize that’s ridiculous. This year, Lattimore is heralded as the best cornerback coming out of college, so the Titans would be wise to choose him over a wide receiver because he definitely won’t be present for their 18th overall pick.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 6 New York Jets:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jamal Adams, S, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been multiple reports recently that a Jamal Adams as a first overall talent. However, analysts agree that the Browns probably won’t trade out of the first pick and will most likely let Adams fall to another team. Regardless, with 209 total tackles and five interceptions throughout his college career, the Jets find their missing link with this pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 7 Los Angeles Chargers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers have built a sneaky good secondary over the past few seasons. So after a stellar combine performance by Malik Hooker, it very well seems he is San Diego-bound. With seven interceptions in only two seasons at Ohio State, Hooker has arguably the best hands in the draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 8 Carolina Panthers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fournette off the board, the Panthers have a choice to make at running back. The very versatile Christian McCaffrey is an interesting option as well, but Carolina will ultimately settle for a halfback that can get it done on every down. At 4,464 yards and 46 touchdowns over three seasons for Florida State, Dalvin Cook will relieve some pressure off his quarterback and former league MVP, Cam Newton.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 9 Cincinnati Bengals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bengals really hit the jackpot with both A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert highlighting their receiving corps. Unfortunately, they both face injury issues from time to time, and this is most likely due to excessive targets are thrown their way. Corey Davis has the speed and build to be a quality NFL wide receiver, so the Bengals use their No. 9 spot to form an elite trio that defenses around the league must respect.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 10 Buffalo Bills:</b></p>\n<p><b>Mike Williams, WR, Clemson </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sammy Watkins can’t get it done all by himself, so the Bills get quarterback Tyrod Taylor another target in Mike Williams. With 2,727 yards and 21 touchdowns over his four-year career at Clemson, Williams is the best receiver in this draft for many analysts. Considering his 98 receptions in just his senior year alone, it’s proven he can handle the workload of a No. 1 receiver as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 11 New Orleans Saints:</b></p>\n<p><b>Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In only three seasons at Tennessee, Derek Barnett racked up 32 sacks and 52 tackles for loss. These are numbers that rival Myles Garrett and other top defensive lineman in this draft, so why is he projected lower than the rest? Well, after an average performance at the NFL combine, Barnett’s draft stock began to slowly fall. Nevertheless, the stats are there and the Saints will capitalize on other teams’ dismissal of Barnett’s talent. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 12 Cleveland Browns:</b></p>\n<p><b>O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Browns will close out their first-round picks with yet another player that is starter ready. O.J. Howard, the four-year tight end out of Alabama, will provide Cleveland with a 6’6” and 242 lbs target that can get it done down the middle or in the red zone. This spot may even see a quarterback selection, but with Terrelle Pryor Sr. out of the mix, another good set of hands may be the more rational option. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 13 Arizona Cardinals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a while now, the Cardinals have been looking for a lockdown corner that can play opposite of Patrick Peterson. Well, luckily for them, reports agree that this year’s draft talent is very deep at the cornerback position. Marlon Humphrey was the star corner at Alabama, so with five interceptions and 81 total tackles in just his two-year college career, this pick makes sense for Arizona.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 14 Philadelphia Eagles:</b></p>\n<p><b>Tre’Davious White, CB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eagles were busy during this offseason free agency with the signings of Alshon Jeffery to the receiving corps and Chris Long to the defensive line. So their remaining draft priorities are for a corner or running back. This can very much be where McCaffrey is selected, but the Eagles ultimately fill the most pressing need and take the 167 total tackles and six interceptions: Tre’Davious White.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 15 Indianapolis Colts:</b></p>\n<p><b>Reuben Foster, LB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s another draft prospect with some astonishing game film. We recommend you look up some Reuben Foster highlights because he could very well be one of the hardest hitting linebackers coming out of college since the turn of the century. With 211 total tackles and seven sacks over three seasons at Alabama, Foster would be a steal for the Colts, if he even falls this far. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 16 Baltimore Ravens:</b></p>\n<p><b>Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ravens will be building through the draft in order to re-establish a frightening defense that has twice earned them a Super Bowl title. With a couple of free agency losses to the defensive line, the Ravens select a quality defensive end in Taco Charlton. Charlton put up 28 tackles for loss and 19 sacks in his four years for Michigan. He also has the best first name in this entire draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 17 Washington Redskins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jabrill Peppers, LB, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve seen mock drafts that have Jabrill Peppers going as early as the top 10 and as late as the second round. So No. 17 overall seems like a fair spot to place the former Heisman nominee. Peppers is an all-around athletic machine, with great stats in both offensive and defensive positions. The Redskins need a playmaker that’ll make his presence known throughout the game, so they pick up this prolific Michigan linebacker.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 18 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>John Ross, WR, Washington </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Ross caught many scouts’ eyes at the combine when he set the 40-yard dash record with a 4.22 time, but it’ll also be his route running skills that’ll make him go in the first round of the NFL draft. In his junior year alone, Ross caught 81 receptions for 1,150 yards and 17 touchdowns. With Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota throwing to him, this wide receiver out of Washington will likely be burning defensive backs all season long.     </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 19 Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Buccaneers are currently rethinking their future with Doug Martin as their lead back. So they’ll look to the draft in order to find a replacement for the pro bowler. Enter Christian McCaffrey, the record-breaking running back out of Stanford. In only three years, McCaffrey rushed for 3,922 yards on 632 attempts. He also caught plenty out of the backfield with 99 receptions for 1,206 yards, bringing his total count to 31 touchdowns. With pick 19, Tampa Bay finds a potential franchise halfback.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 20 Denver Broncos:</b></p>\n<p><b>Garett Bolles, OT, Utah</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a bit of a quarterback conundrum going on in Denver at the moment. Whether it’s Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch lining up under center, they’ll need to beef up their offensive line in this year’s draft. With the Bronco’s first round pick, they select, the 6’5” and 300-pound offensive tackle, Garett Bolles out of Utah. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 21 Detroit Lions:</b></p>\n<p><b>Charles Harris, DE, Missouri </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this pick, the Lions pretty much just go for the best available player still on the board. With 34.5 tackles for loss and 18 sacks in his three seasons at Missouri, Charles Harris’s size and athleticism will easily translate into continued success within the NFL. He’ll also greatly complement Ezekiel Ansah and Haloti Ngata on the Detroit defensive line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 22 Miami Dolphins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Forrest Lamp, OG, Western Kentucky</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could argue that quarterback Ryan Tannehill isn’t at the franchise level, but with quality starting quarterbacks currently a scarcity in the league, the Dolphins decide to add more depth to the pass protection position. Forrest Lamp, after a great combine showing and consistent college numbers, is arguably the best offensive prospect in this year’s draft.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 23 New York Giants:</b></p>\n<p><b>Ryan Ramczyk, OT, Wisconsin </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quarterback has also been projected for this pick, but the Giants ultimately decide to choose a tackle that can protect their star quarterback Eli Manning. At 6’6” and 314 lbs, Ryan Ramczyk will not only protect from the pass rush but also help with the outside running game in New York.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 24 Oakland Raiders:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik McDowell, DL, Michigan State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McDowell’s draft stock rose after his combine day impressed various scouts. Now the Raiders are projected to select this three-year Michigan State Spartan that recorded 24.5 tackles for loss with 88 total tackles.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 25 Houston Texans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, we have the first quarterback in the entire draft go at No. 25. Deshaun Watson, out of Clemson, is arguably the most prepared when it comes to being in control and winning games for his team. In 38 games for Clemson, he put up over 10,000 passing yards for a total of 90 touchdowns. The Texans Band-Aid their Brock Osweiler mistake and get potentially a franchise quarterback in Watson with their first-round pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 26 Seattle Seahawks:</b></p>\n<p><b>Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been plenty of rumors recently that the Seahawks will lose star cornerback Richard Sherman via trade, causing Seattle to draft defensive back Kevin King in the first. However, we believe Sherman will be in a Seahawks uniform next year and that Cam Robinson will be plugged right into Seattle’s o-line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 27 Kansas City Chiefs:</b></p>\n<p><b>Zach Cunningham, LB, Vanderbilt</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kansas City’s defense has been a force to be reckoned with in past seasons, so they’ll add to the hype with this pick. Following Reuben Foster, Zach Cunningham is in the conversation for the next best at the linebacker position. This playmaker out of Vanderbilt is a tackling machine, with 256 total tackles in just three seasons of his college career. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 28 Dallas Cowboys:</b></p>\n<p><b>Takkarist McKinley, LB, UCLA </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cowboys have gotten a lot of criticism recently concerning their defensive play, and after losing a few starters to free agency, there’ll be some spots to fill. Cornerbacks, like Sidney Jones or Teez Tabor, who slipped out of the early first round are projected here. However, the Cowboys go ahead and choose UCLA linebacker Takkarist McKinley for his big frame and great athleticism. </span><br>\n<b>No. 29 Green Bay Packers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Gareon Conley, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a roulette of starters and a couple of injuries at cornerback, Green Bay decides to go with a Buckeye and select Gareon Conley as their first-rounder. Conley had 91 tackles and six interceptions in his three seasons at Ohio State. Alongside Lattimore and Hooker, Conley helped form perhaps the best defensive back trio in college football last season. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 30 Pittsburgh Steelers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Obi Melifonwu, S, Connecticut </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obi Melifonwu had arguably the best combine day out of anyone else in the draft. At 6’3” and 217 lbs, his draft stock skyrocketed after he put on a show in front of the scouts. In four seasons with Connecticut, Melifonwu made 349 total tackles and caught eight interceptions as a college safety.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 31 Atlanta Falcons:  </b></p>\n<p><b> T.J. Watt, LB, Wisconsin</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a disastrous Super Bowl, Atlanta is now aware of a few spots that need replacing throughout the defensive line. So they look to linebacker T.J. Watt out of Wisconsin to remedy this. In just a pair of seasons, Watt had 17 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks. This 6’5” linebacker definitely has the size to be in this league, but can he be as big as his brother J.J. Watt? The Falcons sure hope so.</span></p>\n<p><b><strong>No.32 </strong>New England Patriots:</b></p>\n<p><strong>Adoree’ Jackson, CB, University of Southern California </strong></p>\n<p>Seeking a defensive leader in their secondary, the Saints will close out the first round finding one in cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. Over his 3 seasons at USC, Jackson put up 139 total tackles and 6 interceptions. To top it all off, he’s also a dual threat on special teams with 4 kickoff return touchdowns and another 4 coming off punt returns.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/","id":3361,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3360,3359,3358],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Drug Policy Aims to Enhance and Cater to the Student Athlete Experience","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"According to the university’s intercollegiate athletics handbook, “The goal of UCSB’s Drug Education, Prevention and Testing Program is to promote a drug- and alcohol-free environment for the in...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>According to the university’s intercollegiate athletics handbook, “The goal of UCSB’s Drug Education, Prevention and Testing Program is to promote a drug- and alcohol-free environment for the intercollegiate competitive program.”</p>\n<p>While headlines and breaking news segments of substance abuse or other drug-related violations tend to have a negative connotation, there are various components that contribute to the formation and current state of athletic drug policies and procedures here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Something helpful to understand is that there is both NCAA drug testing policies and procedures, and there’s also institutional drug policies and procedures,” Deputy Athletics Director and Senior Woman Administrator Kelly Barsky explained. “In most cases they’re very much alike.

I think the NCAA put [the rules] in place for competitive equity [to] make sure there’s not drug use that then potentially enhances performance, which creates an inequity [on] the playing field,” Barsky said. “The institutional drug policies and procedures may provide some of that, but it’s also to provide support for student-athlete health and wellness.”</p>\n<p>It is this dimension of health and wellness that has distinguished the foundation of UCSB’s drug policies and procedures, aiding their emphasis on not leaving student-athletes in the position to come to conclusions through trial and error, but rather with “drug education, prevention and testing.”</p>\n<p>Although the Intercollegiate Athletics (ICA) building serves as most UCSB student-athletes’ sanctuary for their needs, ensuring that they are also aware of the multitude of on-campus resources is one of the primary components on Barsky’s agenda.</p>\n<p>“My primary function is to provide oversight and support to a lot of our internal components within the [athletics] department,” Barsky said. “[This includes] sports medicine, sport performance, our collaboration with academic services, NCAA compliance [and] student advisory council. Anything pertaining to providing internal support or collaboration with the student athlete experience.”</p>\n<p>Busy with practice, games, traveling, courses and catching up on homework to remain eligible for play all while trying to maintain a social life, the student-athlete experience includes an intensified form of the typical student’s yearn for balance and time for self.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77179\" style=\"width: 341px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=77179\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77179\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77179\" data-attachment-id=\"77179\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/drug-policty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=1583%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1583,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"drug policty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77179\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty-792x1024.jpg?resize=331%2C428\" alt=\"\" width=\"331\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 792w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?w=1583&amp;ssl=1 1583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The array of responsibilities can be overwhelmingly stressful, especially with the prevalence of peer pressure or the temptations that exist within Isla Vista that sometimes lead to violations and misconduct.</p>\n<p>An awareness of these temptations is necessary as student-athletes are provided with no timetable concerning the frequency of drug testing throughout the regular or off seasons.</p>\n<p>“The NCAA as well as the institutional drug policy has random testing dates,” Barsky said. “There’s no schedule or schedule per sport. We can be notified or student-athletes can be notified anytime that there will be a test within a 24-hour period. The [athletics] department works with Drug Free Sport, which is the same company that administers drug testing for the NCAA.”</p>\n<p>Although the NCAA lays out the foundation for institutions to follow, UCSB’s drug policy prides itself on providing student-athletes with resources that are not only primarily concerned with performance but the overall mental and physical health as well.</p>\n<p>“I think the institutional structure provides a little more support. Again, you’re still [subject to] year-round random selection, but if you’re selected and there’s a positive test, there’s a process for support and potentially rehabilitation,” Barsky said. “Your first sanction is to follow the process of working with the alcohol and drug program. A second positive [or more] will lead to sanctions within your playing season, but it’s also to provide and use counseling services. The NCAA doesn’t have those supports in place like we have as an institution.”</p>\n<p>“We use the drug testing policy as well as a lot of resources. Services such as student health, the alcohol and drug program and C.A.P.S. We try to use our resources to provide the best education to student-athletes about drugs, alcohol and choices in general.

What should be taken into full account when evaluating and labeling a point guard with what has become such an unpredictable status? Is it assists? Points? Plus/minus value? Postseason success/experience?</p>\n<p>No clear-cut answer prevails, and there’s no guarantee as to whether or not there will ever be one. Yet, the time is now to acknowledge and appreciate the mounting progression of the point guard earning more stardom in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The traditional approach of being a pass-first, low-scoring point no longer defines the coveted floor general. Although the fundamentals of being able to run and orchestrate the offense from the top of the key are still staples, the “one” has transformed into a more versatile entity within itself.</p>\n<p>While various elements, including the type of offensive/defensive systems implemented, player roles, scouting, coaching and executive responsibilities, each have an influence on player performance, point guards are reaching a new pinnacle of significance.</p>\n<p>NBA history has been rewritten following the milestones of point guards over the years.</p>\n<p>From Derrick Rose becoming the youngest NBA MVP ever to Steph Curry becoming the first ever unanimous NBA MVP in his second-straight winning of the award to Russell Westbrook breaking Oscar Robertson’s record by setting the new single-season triple-double record at 42, the NBA’s longtime “Where Amazing Happens” campaign seems to be most fittingly applied to today’s arsenal of point guards.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the 2017 NBA Draft — set to take place on June 22, 2017 — the point guard position is set to be the most coveted cohort of players on the board in the early portion of the first round.</p>\n<p>It is possible that five point guards — Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina — could be selected in the lottery, which would be the most since 1999.</p>\n<p>While the upcoming class of point guards will anticipate adding their own style to the game, the diverse makeup of today’s offensive leaders include a nostalgic nature as well.</p>\n<p>Reminiscent with the likes of legends Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Oscar Robertson, the notion of the “point forward” is even more relevant in the NBA today with the emergence of the aforementioned Antetokounmpo and James or the 76ers’ decision that Ben Simmons will run the point in his debut next season.</p>\n<p>Likely to be judged as oversized or too uncoordinated for the point position if viewed by the standards of the ABA or NBA’s early years, the developing trend of bigger, stronger and massively built players has changed the prototypical state of the point guard for the better.</p>\n<p>Just look at the hype and frenzy we all went into when then prospect 7-footer Thon Maker’s basketball highlight tape went viral on social media, with him coming up the court and performing AND-1 like, ankle-breaking crossovers while pulling up for shots from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p>Surely there’s no way anyone could discredit the heart and talent of current playmakers like Chris Paul or Isaiah Thomas, who are on the shorter side of the height spectrum, but the existence of the “Space Jam” Monstars build (for lack of a better word) of players transitioning into point guards is fascinating and fun to watch.</p>\n<p>Despite the contrast in build and body frame, this same transition applies with players like James Harden, who was named the Houston Rockets’ point guard after the hiring of Mike D’Antoni and has exceled since then. He finished the 2016-17 NBA regular season with career highs in points per game, assists (11.2) and rebounds (8.1), leaving many in favor of him winning the NBA MVP award.</p>\n<p>With an ability to create his own shot and drain it from either short or long-range distances and drive and kill defenders off with his signature Euro-step or draw fouls, Harden’s skillset has been enhanced most by his improved vision on the court when scoring or finding open teammates.</p>\n<p>But the dynamic of the point guard doesn’t end with size, athleticism, scoring or passing ability; it also includes the slashing and aggressive nature of players such as potential NBA MVP Russell Westbrook and John Wall.</p>\n<p>Although everyone is entitled to and possesses their own liking for each style, the NBA point guard has become somewhat atypical due to the fact that it’s a position constantly redefining itself.</p>\n<p>With the NBA playoffs in full effect, all of the league’s top point guards are performing on the game’s biggest stage. It is time for us all to delay the “elite” discussion and appreciate what’s available at the moment before it’s too late, and all that’s remaining are game highlights and jerseys in the rafters.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/","id":1911,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1910,1909,1908],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2016-17 NBA Awards Predictions: Will ‘The Beard’ Prevail?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.09.48-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.09.48-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the regular season officially over, it is now time to reflect upon each player’s impact and determine what praise is deserved.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Most Valuable Player: James Harden, Houston Rockets</strong></p>\n<p>When the NBA MVP race is this close, it comes down to wins.

Harden leads the league in offensive win shares per Basketball Reference as well as win shares overall. That’s generally a pretty good indicator of a worthy MVP.</p>\n<p>Westbrook leads the league in player efficiency rating, another solid MVP benchmark. There’s a counter for every argument but one: wins.<br>\nHarden’s Rockets have secured the third seed in the west while Westbrook’s Thunder was only able to sneak in at the six spot. With that, Harden is the rightful MVP.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Player of Year: Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors</strong></p>\n<p>Almost no one likes Draymond Green, and for good reason: He plays dirty, as Steven Adams can tell you, and he can be incredibly annoying. That said, he’s still the best defensive player in the league this year.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think there’s a serious case to be made that he’s been the best defender in the league for the past few years, but that’s a different debate.<br>\nNo one else in the NBA quarterbacks a defense like Green does. He’s constantly moving and talking, the heart and soul of a very good Warriors defense.</p>\n<p>He’s tied for the league lead in steals with John Wall, and he’s 14th in blocks.<br>\nOpponents shoot just 40 percent when matched up with Green, per NBA.com. That number rises to only 48.2 percent from inside six feet. Just for reference, opponents shoot 49 percent against Rudy Gobert, who’s quite a bit larger than Green.</p>\n<p>Gobert and Kawhi Leonard are both fantastic defenders, but they just can’t compare with what Green does on defense.</p>\n<p>He’s the most versatile and effective defender in the NBA, and that’s why he’s my Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>Rookie of the Year: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p>\n<p>Joel Embiid was the best rookie in the NBA this year. That’s why he should get the award.</p>\n<p>It’s really that simple. I realize he only played in 31 games, but that doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>Just because Malcolm Brogdon and Dario Saric played all year doesn’t mean they were better rookies than Embiid.</p>\n<p>In only 25 minutes per game, Embiid averaged 20.2 points and 7.8 rebounds, all while giving Philadelphia the first breath of basketball hope it’s felt since “The Process” began.</p>\n<p>When Embiid was on the court, he was as dominant as any rookie I can remember, holding his own against players like DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p>There’s no way that Brogdon (10.2/2.8/4.3) or Saric (12.8/6.3/2.2) match up with what Embiid did, even taking into account the missed games. Were this the MVP award, I could agree with the pro-Brogdon/Saric arguments. This is the Rookie of the Year Award, though, and Embiid is far and away the most deserving candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>Sixth Man of the Year: Andre Iguodala, Golden State Warriors</strong></p>\n<p>It’s hard to feel good about giving any award to a player with a slash line of 7.6/4.0/3.4. Those are solid numbers for a role player but they don’t exactly scream “Sixth Man of the Year” at first glance.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s important to go a little deeper with Andre Iguodala.<br>\nEric Gordon and Lou Williams have flashier stats, but Iguodala has been absolutely essential to the Warriors, particularly after Kevin Durant went down with a knee injury.</p>\n<p>Iguodala’s 4.5 assist-to-turnover ratio is the best in the league, a demonstration of how he steadies the occasionally turbulent Warriors offense.</p>\n<p>He’s still a top-notch defender, too, with a solid 101 defensive rating. A scoring average of 7.6 points per game makes Iguodala an unexciting award candidate, but the rest of his stats make him a deserving one.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Improved Player: James Johnson, Miami Heat</strong></p>\n<p>Coming into this season, there were essentially no outside expectations for James Johnson. He was a largely anonymous veteran backup on a one-year, $4 million deal who had never averaged double-digit points per game and hadn’t played much the season prior.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this season, Johnson became one of the linchpins of Miami’s stunning drive to playoff contention, averaging career highs in points (12.8), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.6) and three-point percentage (34.5 percent, up from 30.3 the year before).</p>\n<p>If that’s not enough to win Most Improved Player, then I don’t know what is.</p>\n<p><strong>Coach of the Year: Mike D’Antoni, Houston Rockets</strong></p>\n<p>The Houston Rockets finished one game ahead of the Utah Jazz for the Western Conference eighth seed with a 41-41 record last year. They were dysfunctional and depressing.</p>\n<p>Harden seemed disinterested at times while Dwight Howard was clearly disinterested at all times. Mike D’Antoni turned this team around.<br>\nThe Rockets were projected to finish 11th in the Western Conference this season by Bleacher Report but, instead, they’re the third seed with more than 50 wins.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, D’Antoni’s offensive system has pushed the Rockets from 106.5 points per game last year to 115.2 this year, behind only the Golden State Warriors.</p>\n<p>Golden State’s Steve Kerr, Washington’s Scott Brooks and Boston’s Brad Stevens are all very strong candidates for the award, but none of those coaches have accomplished anything close to the kind of job D’Antoni has in bringing his team from the infighting and apathy of last year’s Rockets to the excellence of this year’s version.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/","id":1906,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[1905,1904,1903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"For the Love of the Game: UCSB Club Baseball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Off to a hot 7-1 and 4-1 conference start, the UCSB club baseball team is looking to shock many as it has made its way into the national club rankings.

What the fourth-year UC Santa Barbara club baseball team captain lacks in terms of size and stature, he makes up with tremendous speed on the basepaths and lightning-quick bat speed. Think of a Dustin Pedroia or a Jose Altuve type. Rosenblum loves the game of baseball and plays with an immeasurable amount of hustle and heart. Not only does he play the game each time as if it is his last, Rosenblum is a true student of the game. After playing second base his first three years at UCSB, this offseason Rosenblum elected to make the transition to third base to open up a spot at second. To learn the nuances of playing third base he sought advice from UCSB division one infielder Jeremiah Muno.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76654\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76654\" data-attachment-id=\"76654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-carries-5-game-win-streak-into-road-slate/img_0695-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0695\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76654\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=566%2C425\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76654\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCSB club baseball’s core group of seniors out at the wood bat tournament in Mesquite, Nevada. <em>Photo courtesy of Max Fernbacher</em></p></div>\n<p>Rosenblum is just one of the reasons UCSB club baseball is off to a hot 7-1 start this season. The other contributions have come from the twenty-nine other players on the roster, all of whom are UCSB students. Four junior college transfers bolster the pitching staff and eight seniors provide leadership on the team. According to Rosenblum the team is composed of former high school and junior college baseball players that simply want to continue playing the sport they love.</p>\n<p>“Our team is made up of guys who want to continue their playing careers after high school or junior college. Many of us have tried to make the division one team here at UCSB but we were unable to secure a roster spot. That includes myself, as I was told I was too small. So we play club baseball because it allows us to play baseball at a high level while we are focused on getting a great education here at UCSB,” Rosenblum said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The club team at UCSB is part of the National Club Baseball Association (NCBA), a national body that governs club baseball at the collegiate level. College club teams in the NCBA either do not have NCAA baseball teams at their schools or like in the case of UCSB have generated enough interest to form a club team. The UCSB club team is in the Southern Pacific West Conference, a NCBA conference that includes Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, UCLA, the University of Southern California, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton. With a 4-1 conference record and 7-1 record overall, the Gauchos trail only Cal Poly SLO in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>In early March the team traveled to play in a wood bat tournament in Mesquite, Nevada and went undefeated in four games. Despite packing four or five ballplayers to a room and living off the $8 Chinese buffet down the street from the hotel, the Gauchos thrived on the field in Mesquite. There they defeated twentieth ranked Utah State to earn a national ranking of their own. Rosenblum could not remember a time in his four years when the UCSB club team had been ranked.</p>\n<p>The team’s early season success can be attributed to each player’s dedication to improvement. Unlike the division one team at UCSB, the club team does not have access to a state of the art weight room or a hitting facility with lights. They lift in the Robertson Gym weight room or UCSB Recreation Center and make the trip over to Girsh Park near Costco to get their hacks in. Last quarter, unable to reserve a diamond at Girsh Park, they practiced twice a week at night on the Recreation Center fields. In essence, the team has embraced the old adage “where there’s a will there’s a way” when it comes to honing their craft.</p>\n<p>Off the field, Rosenblum acts as club president and is thus responsible for all the team logistics. This includes dealing with jerseys, gear, finances and arranging field time for the team.</p>\n<p>“Dealing with team dues, uniforms, gear and umpires can be time consuming but it is just part of my role as president. But really nothing has been tougher than our inability to find a field for practices and games. We are at the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to getting field reservations, below high school and even little league teams in the area,” Rosenblum said.</p>\n<p>However, things are looking up for the team as spring quarter approaches. According to Rosenblum, the team has made arrangements to practice and play at Girsh Park for spring quarter. Thus, they will no longer have to practice at the Recreation Center fields nor have to travel 55 miles south to play their home games in Santa Paula.</p>\n<p>Michael Gilbert a fourth-year math major and first generation college student, credits the club baseball team as the most important extracurricular outlet for him in college. The self-described “pride of Moreno Valley”, Gilbert has a love for the game that compares to Rosenblum’s. Quiet and humble, similar to fellow Moreno Valley native Kawhi Leonard, Gilbert has been a valuable utility player for the team the past four years. Gilbert says playing on the club team all four years of college has been his defining experience at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“To be honest, I do not think I would have been able to get this far in school if I was not playing club baseball. I did not know what I was getting myself into coming to UCSB and we all know college can be very taxing on your mind. I feel lucky to have been able to play baseball for the past four years with a group of guys that became my best friends.

His athleticism was evident even then, with a recorded 10.68 100m time in his senior year track season as well as his 35-plus-inch vertical leap.</p>\n<p>“It was tough and a big learning curve,” Azu-Irondi admitted. “It was good, though; I made some cool friends and learned a lot. As a little freshman coming in and playing football at a D-I university, it was tough but it was fun.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi floundered in the transition to college football, though, as he redshirted his first year before transferring to his hometown community college, College of the Canyons, to live closer to his family and try to get back to a four-year university as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“At College of the Canyons I was doing my best to get out with a scholarship, but things weren’t working out, but I was still fast, you know?” Azu-Irondi laughed. “So during track season, I did what I could and did my own recruiting.”</p>\n<p>After three back-and-forths with Coach Anderson, a former sprinter at Oregon, the prospective Canyon transfer was left wondering about his future and searched everywhere for a new track home. Finally, in the summer of 2015, Azu-Irondi sent an email asking if UCSB was still interested, and his new coach responded saying that he’d be a Gaucho in the fall.</p>\n<p>An ankle injury kept him sidelined for the vast majority of his first year in Santa Barbara, but Azu-Irondi chugged through this rough patch, biding his time for a historic return.</p>\n<p>“When I kicked it on around the 15-meter mark, I made up for it,” Azu-Irondi recalled of his historic dash at UC San Diego two weeks ago. “My turnover came in, not as fast as Coach has seen me or I had wanted it, but once I turned it on, I stayed strong even though I was a little tense after having to catch up from the slow start.”</p>\n<p>“It was a solid race. I’d say like a seven out of 10.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi speaks so humbly of his 100m time, but when 10.55s flashed on the scoreboard next to his name, the San Fernando native solidified his place in the UCSB record books as the fastest man in school history — just barely beating Sandy Combs’s 30-year-old record of 10.56s.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he prefers to keep a low profile while he sends waves nationwide during his first D-I track season. But as every great runner knows, it takes a bit of arrogance to succeed on the track, and even Azu-Irondi, after enough prodding, confidently declared his goal for the season, which is as grand a goal as a college sprinter can have.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna be in the World Championships in London. I have to hit a 10.12 to get to the trials and then go from there. I don’t want to jinx it, but I could see myself doing some crazy things. Especially with the help of Coach Anderson, I’m gonna get there for sure.”</p>\n<p>A bold benchmark to set for oneself, undoubtedly, but everything about Azu-Irondi is bold. He walks around the track with his chest out and a massive smile on his face and proceeds to leave the audience stunned with his smooth stride and blazing speed. His confidence can be seen in his step, but it is partnered with a hard-working, humble upbringing that clearly has the sprinter prepped for great success.</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi is just getting started, too.

\r\n</script> \n<p>While baseball was invented in the United States, it is a game that has evolved below the equator in many Latin American countries.</p>\n<p>When the U.S. military began to occupy Latin America in the early 1900s, soldiers brought along the game of baseball and the native peoples took it and transformed it.<br>\nGone were the rigid unwritten rules that chastised emotional outbursts and encouraged robotic behavior.</p>\n<p>Latinos played baseball the way they played soccer: with their hearts on their sleeves and exuberance in every at-bat.</p>\n<p>This energy has translated into great success for Latinos in the MLB who, with pioneers like Orlando Cepeda and contemporary phenoms like the late Jose Fernandez, have more than caught up skill- and talent-wise with the “originators” of baseball.</p>\n<p>When Bud Norris says, “We’re opening the game,” he puts himself, and subsequently white men as the gatekeepers of who is allowed to play, essentially disregarding the notion of a meritocracy that is crucial to all sports.</p>\n<p>To behave as though one group has the right to include or exclude people from the game of baseball is to ignore the history of how the game has proliferated to other countries, and it creates a false narrative that devalues the contributions of Latinos to the game.</p>\n<p>The other problematic aspect of this quote is the feeling that Latinos are bringing a sense of disrespect to the game.</p>\n<p>Even though Latinos make up about 26 percent of the league, almost 50 percent of the brawls this year have pitted whites against Latinos.</p>\n<p>Whether it is a Yasiel Puig bat-flip or a Jose Bautista home run trot around the bases that is deemed a little too long, there is something that pisses pitchers (a predominantly white position) off about the way that Latinos play the game.</p>\n<p>However, it isn’t merely the Latino style of play that is aggravating to players; it is the fact that they seemingly don’t respect “American” culture.</p>\n<p>This is exemplified in the recent story of a minor league training room in which a white player killed the radio that some Latinos were listening to some Spanish music on and declared,</p>\n<p>“Hey, Reggaeton, es no bueno. America! English music!”</p>\n<p>This notion that it is somehow disrespectful to America and baseball to express your Latin identity is problematic in that it establishes a hierarchy of cultures in the MLB that allows some players to feel entitled to denounce others not based on their play but on their culture.</p>\n<p>I do not want to give off the impression that this attitude is present in all MLB players. For instance, former catcher Dave Valle learned Spanish while playing winter ball in Latin America for five seasons.</p>\n<p>He said, “The benefits were me having a world view of what my teammates came from.”</p>\n<p>It gave me a better understanding of the Latin culture, and as a teammate, it helped me as a leader to be that bridge between the American guys and Latino guys because I could speak a little bit of Spanish and help them.”</p>\n<p>This drive to create empathy and companionship among different cultures is what is necessary to have a more equal and unified MLB, and only once this is attained can baseball truly be America’s pastime.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

2010, 2012 and 2014, the San Francisco Giants celebrated three World Series championships. A baseball dynasty emerged in a historical 2010 season after having not won a World Series since 1954, back when the Giants were still located in New York.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Diehard fans were overjoyed to finally watch their team take home some long-awaited hardware. It was a thrilling and hopeful time for all Giants fans when they took another championship in 2012, and by San Francisco’s 2014 World Series triumph, the world of baseball started to acknowledge the bizarre pattern the Giants were somehow pulling off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco had a rough year in 2015, but the idea of the widely acclaimed “even-year” streak gave fans faith and high expectations for the following season. Seemingly, 2016 mirrored 2014. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Giants began the season with tremendous success, and then barely scraped by into the playoffs with a wild card berth. Other playoff teams and managers began to fear the strength and endurance of the Giants once they made it to the postseason, especially during an even year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The franchise went nuts with this as a marketing opportunity. Various signs, foam fingers, baseball hats, t-shirts, and chants were formed around this even-year idea along with the widely popular “Don’t Stop BeliEVEN” slogan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giants fans had to have known that it could only last so long when taking into account that there was no logical reasoning for how this “magic” was happening and why, but the phrases were catchy, the environment at AT&amp;T Park was unsurpassable and the belief of it all brought a great deal of optimism and playful banter among Giants fans and their rivals.</span></p>\n<p>2016 seemed like another ambitious year for the Giants to achieve the status of World Series champions, especially after making it through an embarrassing second half of the season.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dominant Madison Bumgarner at the mound made a return to the postseason after his historic 2014 run, and Conor Gillaspie, an unlikely postseason hero blasting a three-run jack in the 9th, powered the Giants past the New York Mets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mets were favored to take the wild card and advance to the NLDS, considering their ace Noah Syndergaard is some sort of mutant science experiment, given his hammer for an arm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Bumgarner was looking to master his craft once again as one of the greatest postseason pitchers, and the Giants overcame Syndergaard and his hammer, allowing the fans to continue believing in the streak. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After coming off a high from their wild card win, the Giants were confident and ready to face the Chicago Cubs, although they knew it would be a challenging feat. San Francisco had a long postseason ahead of them, while the Cubs had been crushing it all season long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicago led 2-0 in a five-game NLDS series when it came time for San Francisco to finally host Game 3. At this point, there was some uncertainty for the Giants, but they rallied when Gillaspie came through once again with a go-ahead triple off of Chapman in the 8th and Brandon Crawford added some cushion to create a 5-3 lead for the Giants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They lost their lead in the 9th when Kris Bryant tied the game 5-5, due to Sergio Romo’s unfortunate ability to give up runs. But, yet again, the Giants vociferously fought back in the bottom of the 13th, many thanks to Joe Panik’s double to drive in Crawford and make it 6-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giants fans were elated at the victory and the Cubs intimidating determination to end their 108-year World Series championship drought became less threatening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as obvious as it was throughout the second half of their 2016 season and postseason, San Francisco’s bullpen was not deep enough to carry them past the Cubs and on to another World Series championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The devastation of saying goodbye to the even-year voodoo was painful. The “BeliEVEN” cheers had died by the end of a disastrous Game 4, in which Matt Moore pitched beautifully until the Giants closers threw their 5-2 lead away by giving up four runs to the Cubs in the 9th.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some argue that manager Bruce Bochy should have never taken Moore out of the game, even though he was nearing a considerably high pitch count. But ultimately, it was a lack of skill in the Giants closers that cost the franchise and its fans another even-year celebration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As heartbreaking as the 2016 postseason was for the Giants and their fans, that even-year magic was sweet while it lasted. By defying the odds, it gave Giants fans something unbelievable to believe in. But of course, there is some hype to get an odd-year streak going, so maybe the magic is not quite dead yet after all.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

you’re thinking about. The World Baseball Classic is here again, starting play on Monday, March 6. Now, I know what you may be thinking: “Who cares?” You probably have a couple good reasons to think that, too.</p>\n<p>After four world baseball classic tournaments, team USA has not even finished in the top three yet. This year, however, is different. Team USA is finally loaded, and they are trying to bring back gold for the first time in the tournament’s history.</p>\n<p>In case you may be unfamiliar with the history of the WBC and why the event came to be, here is some background. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee voted out baseball as an official Olympic sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because athletes still wanted to play and represent their home countries and their ancestral backgrounds, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association proposed an idea to the International Baseball Federation to somehow keep the Olympic-style play alive. The IBAF agreed and the World Baseball Classic was born. The first WBC would be held one year later in 2006.</p>\n<p>Modeled after the FIFA World Cup, the WBC features 16 teams that represent different countries. This year, Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, the U.S., and Venezuela are in the official tournament.</p>\n<p>Each year, however, more and more countries enter to play in the WBC. France, Panama, Brazil, Germany, New Zealand, the Philippines, Great Britain, Nicaragua, South Africa, the Czech Republic, Pakistan and Spain were represented as well. Although these countries did not qualify for the main tournament, they did play in the qualifying rounds trying to enter the WBC. I bet you didn’t know some of these countries played baseball, huh?</p>\n<p>The past winners of the WBC include only two countries: Japan (2006, 2009) and the Dominican Republic (2013). In these years, team USA did not have a roster that represented its full potential as a country.</p>\n<p>This was because the WBC title did not have much worth to players born and raised in the U.S. Instead, All-Star caliber Major League Ball Players would elect to stay in spring training to get ready for the regular 162-game season, which includes chasing the most important title of all: World Series Champion.</p>\n<p>Paired with this, there is a lot more opportunity to make money performing well in the MLB compared to playing well in the WBC.</p>\n<p>Still, this did not stop other All-Star Major Leaguers in the past from joining their respected countries. The Dominican Republic, Japan, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have all been represented by their best athletes every WBC due to one reason and one reason only: pride.</p>\n<p>Now, enter USA in the 2017 WBC. As reported by baseball beat writers and analysts, Americans are sick of being made fun of in their locker rooms for not having a WBC title yet; they are simply tired of being mocked for doing poorly in a tournament for a sport they themselves created.</p>\n<p>So what did they do? They got together the best damn team they could.</p>\n<p>Team USA is now the favorite to win the WBC because of the team’s ridiculously stacked roster. The position players representing the U.S. are Buster Posey, Jonathan Lucroy, A.J. Ellis, Nolan Arenado, Alex Bregman, Matt Carpenter, Brandon Crawford, Paul Goldschmidt, Eric Hosmer, Ian Kinsler, Daniel Murphy, Adam Jones, Andrew McCutchen, Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich.</p>\n<p>You may be thinking, where is Mike Trout? Where is Bryce Harper? Where is Corey Seager? Although these players and more were asked, they all declined for reasons stated above.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. will have the most powerful and skilled lineup the team has had in its history by far, and the most dangerous lineup in the tournament by a wide margin.</p>\n<p>Although they recently lost Cy Young winner Max Scherzer to a finger injury, the pitching staff includes other big names such as Chris Archer, Marcus Stroman, Michael Fulmer, Tanner Roark and Andrew Miller.</p>\n<p>The U.S. wants a piece of the WBC title pie. For the first time ever, they have a really good chance. With all this talent, will America’s golden boys pull through?</p>\n<p>In their first round pool (Pool C), team USA’s biggest threat will be the Dominican Republic, which is one of the few other teams that have a big-league roster. The U.S. should have no problems with the other two teams in their pool, Colombia, and Canada, but if the U.S. can beat out the Dominican Republic, then it should have a straight run for gold.</p>\n<p>Even though play will begin with a matchup between Israel and Korea at 1:30 a.m., team U.S.A. will not have its first game until March 10, at which they will take on Colombia in Miami.</p>\n<p>The final round of the WBC will take place in Southern California at Dodger Stadium from March 20-22. Do not miss the WBC. For the first time ever, team USA could be crowned the champion right here in our own backyard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76218\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76218\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/","id":1902,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

The 6’7” goaltender was sent along with a fifth-round pick in the 2017 draft in exchange for Erik Cernak, a defensive prospect groomed by the Kings, a seventh-round pick, a conditional pick and goaltender “St.” Peter Budaj.</p>\n<p>The move completes St. Peter’s martyrdom after he essentially saved the season for the Kings when Jonathan Quick went down with a groin injury in the season opener against the Sharks. (However, “saved” may be too complimentary a term as the Kings now sit three games behind the St. Louis Blues for the second wild card spot in the West.)</p>\n<p>Many have wondered why the Kings, one day after Quick returned from his long-term injury, would move for a second elite goaltender in Bishop and renounce any loyalty at the expense of Budaj.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First off, Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi is no stranger to making blockbuster deals at the deadline (March 1). In 2012, Lombardi traded defenseman Jack Johnson to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Jeff Carter, who is currently the second leading goal scorer in the NHL.</p>\n<p>Carter proved to be an integral part of the team in their championship run later that year and has since molded himself into a team leader. In 2014 the Kings moved for Marian Gaborik, a star forward who would go on to lead the team to a championship with a league-high 14 goals in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Lombardi’s luck would change in 2015 when he sent a defensive prospect and a first-round pick for Andrej Sekera, who proved to be a non-factor in the Kings’ dud 2014-2015 season.</p>\n<p>Even given Lombardi’s propensity for big moves at the deadline, this one still baffles as the Kings’ problem isn’t letting in goals, it’s scoring them. Let’s dissect the trade to see what Lombardi may have been thinking when he pulled the trigger on this transaction.</p>\n<p>Having a reliable goaltending tandem is never negative, but why would you choose to sit one when each of those goalies was Vezina candidates a year ago? It could point to some uncertainty regarding Quick’s health. With his jarring, athletic butterfly style, Quick is more exposed to the possibility of injury than a goalie with a stay-at-home, blocking style.</p>\n<p>Quick’s groin injury this year was the most severe of his career, and the Kings’ primary concern should be to avoid a chronic injury that might detract from his play throughout the remaining six seasons of his contract. If Budaj seemed to be a competent safety net, Bishop is a brick wall in front of a maximum security prison.</p>\n<p>Emotional attachment aside, the Kings didn’t have to give up a whole lot for “Big Ben” Bishop: they lost what was their third-string goalie at the start of the year, essentially traded up from a seventh-round to a fifth-round pick, gave up a defenseman (whom the team did not consider a top prospect) and a conditional pick. The conditional pick throws some salt into the mix, as it could soar to as high as the second round if the Kings do well in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>From the Lightning side, Andrei Vasilevskiy is the face of the future; Bishop has spent a relatively large amount of time on the bench given his $6 million cap hit (20 percent of which the Lightning will retain as part of the deal) and is an unrestricted free agent at season’s end. They were going to lose him anyway; Budaj will be a great second goalie to have as the team grooms Vasilevskiy to be its No. 1.</p>\n<p>As counterintuitive as it may seem, sporting two top-tier goalies may help to alleviate the Kings’ scoring troubles. The team’s dynamic shifts dramatically when Quick is in net. When Budaj was starting, many offensively minded forwards had to adjust their game to protect a vulnerable goalie situation (in terms of both efficiency and depth).</p>\n<p>The Kings’ defense also had to double-down on their efforts and play a largely conservative game focused on protecting their goalie instead of creating scoring chances. With Quick in net (and now a “second” Quick in Bishop), the Kings can relax their style to generate more offense with the reassurance that reliable goaltending brings.</p>\n<p>Here’s where Lombardi’s chess game gets interesting. The Kings have four double-header games of their remaining 20. Of those games, three(!) include a game against the team that may be standing in their way of a playoff spot: the Calgary Flames.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with a fourth game against Calgary in the final week, these games present a possible plus-or-minus 16-point swing in the standings the Kings can’t afford to be on the wrong side of.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Kings take the top goalie on the trade block off the table for the Flames, a team that has given up the most goals of any team in playoff position in the Western Conference. Now every team the Kings play will have to face either Bishop or Quick, which is certainly not an enviable position to be in.</p>\n<p>With two days left until the trade deadline, there is still a possibility Bishop is flipped to another team that would be willing to send a reputable forward to the Kings. Lombardi, however, has softened this stance, saying, “No, no. Bishop needs to play.”</p>\n<p>So it seems the Kings will roll with two No. 1 goaltenders in a last-ditch effort to move into playoff positioning. As Kings fans mourn the sacrifice of St. Peter, a goalie who ascended to fan favorite as quickly as he was traded away, a new piece will be in place for a deep playoff run with Bishop.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/","id":1901,"author":{"id":316,"name":"Zack Zimmerman"},"related":[1900,1899,1898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tales Of The Tearing: Knees Beware","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ACL.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ACL.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"ACL and other knee related injuries have hindered the careers of various athletes.

What precautionary measures should be taken to avoid this setback and stay on a healthy path?</p>\n<p>Simply put, these are some crucial questions that unfortunately have no set answer. As a victim of this physical injury myself, I can honestly say the nature of an ACL tear is unpredictable. Much like what makes sports today so exciting, these unexpected moments of thrill and sorrow come and go as they please, keeping fans on the edge of their seats for the better but sometimes for the worse.</p>\n<p>Injuries are never a favorable circumstance for any athlete, but lessons can be learned in the process of this hardship and illuminate the true value of sports that lie beyond any court or hardwood floor.</p>\n<p>The first message would be to trust the process. A term coined after Philadelphia 76er Joel Embiid, an athlete’s journey is filled with unexpected trials and tribulations. Similar to the seven-footer’s process of being a high lottery pick in the NBA and then subsequently being sidelined for a season-ending surgery, our highest goals and ambitions can often be deterred by reality, but that doesn’t mean it has to stop there. In the lead for Rookie of the Year and averaging 29.6 points per game per 36 minutes, this guy is living proof that one can bounce back from a season-ending injury. It takes belief and confidence to know that one’s situation does not dictate the future road ahead.  Embiid’s will to work past his setback — much like other players who have sustained ACL injuries — has fueled his placement in the NBA and stake as one of the best young big men. All it takes is trusting the process.</p>\n<p>In the lead for Rookie of the Year and averaging 29.6 points per game per 36 minutes, this guy is living proof that one can bounce back from a season-ending injury.

There will be highs, lows and even lower periods where you feel that your injury has taken you to the end of the road.</p>\n<p>Former first overall pick Derrick Rose can attest to this, suffering not only an ACL tear but also a meniscus tear during the peak of his career.  While a major blow to one of the most explosive guards of our time, the Chicago native stuck through it and continues to follow his passion to this day: playing basketball. Rose continues to prove doubters wrong and show flashes of the athletic D-Rose, now in a New York Knick uniform.</p>\n<p>Whether professional or recreational, there is something common athletes like ourselves can take out of the career of Rose and other recipients of the ACL scare.</p>\n<p>Being on the road is never easy when it comes to sports. There will be setbacks, both physical and emotional, that continue to test one’s character. The ability to come to terms with this and understand that everyone has their own struggles and is in the process of conquering them is a bond that moves beyond the confines of gamesmanship. Trust the experience, trust the process and certainly trust the ride.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76102\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76102\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/","id":1900,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1899,1898,1897],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
