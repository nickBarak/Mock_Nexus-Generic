Years and years of research has been done and continues as the search to discover a cure for cancer persist. It’s an illness that even the most healthful individual cannot predict to occur in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>For Kansas City Chiefs’ strong safety Eric Berry, week six of the 2014 NFL season will forever be a life-changing experience. On December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2014, news surfaced that Berry was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma.</p>\n<p>After missing the remainder of last season, Berry is set to make his return tomorrow night in the Chiefs preseason opener against the Arizona Cardinals. While it is not determined how much playing time he will receive, Berry has been making encouraging strides in training camp. Just last Thursday, Berry sent the sports world into a frenzy after making a diving interception during practice.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The fifth overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft from the University of Tennessee, Berry has been a relentless force since entering the league. His hard-nosed, aggressive playing style allowed him to have an immediate impact as he earned the starting safety spot in his first season and has excelled ever since.</p>\n<p>Battling cancer is an unfathomable challenge that one can only hope to survive. Berry’s fearless spirit while facing his battle with cancer is exemplary of a courageous warrior disguised as a football player.</p>\n<p>The grueling treatment of chemotherapy is a process that usually causes the physical and psychological strength of cancer stricken individuals to plummet. However, for Berry the time spent during recovery was a period that displayed his dedication and commitment to not surrender.</p>\n<p>During each chemotherapy session, Berry had an IV inserted into his body in order to work out while under treatment. By the end of his treatment, Berry was one pound heavier than when he first was diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Berry’s superhuman abilities may set him aside from others, but he has become another example for people worldwide. His devotion while on his road to recovery is motivation for individuals that are ill or healthy to never take life for granted and to embrace its challenges.</p>\n<p>While Berry’s health and ability to persevere is paramount in him getting back on the field, the NFL’s support during his absence was just as important. Players, fans, and teams all over the league joined in support of the “Berry Strong” campaign. Most notably, t-shirts boasting the slogan of “Be Bold, Be Brave, Be Berry,” became a popular choice of support by many.</p>\n<p>Of course we’re all glad to see the return of football with the NFL preseason, but tomorrow night’s game has an overarching importance that goes beyond the field. It’s the brotherhood and unity within the NFL that will be in full effect tomorrow as we all welcome Eric Berry back.</p>\n<p>Berry’s recovery continues as he works himself back into the first-team All-Pro, three-time Pro Bowler that we know him to be. While it may take a while to return to that elite level, expect Berry to prove any limitation upon him wrong.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/","id":3283,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3282,3281,3280],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Special Olympics: Not All Superheroes Wear Capes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What makes someone a hero?

This iconic ceremony let the world know that being a great athlete isn’t decided by one’s physical appearance or abilities, but rather by strength within.</p>\n<p>Take Scott Rohrer as a prime example. An individual that suffers from autism, Rohrer did not let his medical condition be a setback.</p>\n<p>The Special Olympics Team USA golfer earned himself a new record on Sunday posting a career low 276, or 12 under par. The golfer’s success has been a common occurrence during the Special Olympics winning three gold medals in 2007, 2009, and 2011.</p>\n<p>Rohrer told ESPN that in all of his golf moments, winning Special Olympics gold ranks “at the top.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never felt anything like this before and it’s a true honor,” he said.</p>\n<p>The four-time champ was not the only athlete that made his mark on Sunday. After 38 battles with liver malfunctions, kidney defects, and strokes, the 5-foot, 2-inch Chevi Peters proved doubters wrong putting on that Team USA uniform.</p>\n<p>With a little lift from his trainer John Lair, Peters accomplished one of his biggest dreams on Sunday – taking first place in the Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>The Kansas native qualified for the combination event, a series of three lifts starting with squats, bench-press, and deadlifts. After pressing a combined 408 pounds in the squat and bench only one more lift stood in the way of Peter’s gold medal.</p>\n<p>Deadlifting a total of 325 pounds and finishing the event with a total of 733 pounds, the “Manimal” lived up to his nickname and embraced his coach in an emotional victory.</p>\n<p>“If you put your mind to it with hard work and dedication anything is possible,” Peters said in an interview with ESPN.</p>\n<p>The lifter went home to Parsons, Kansas with 4 medals in total, one silver and three gold.</p>\n<p>His will to never give up is a testament to younger ones everywhere. Peters proved that dreams can come true and that you can inspire those around you.

four-year, $87.6 million ($60 million guaranteed) contract extension with the Seattle Seahawks is an offseason move that we eventually expected and are all glad to see be completed.</p>\n<p>There was much curiosity as to whether or not Seattle and Wilson would come to an agreement before the start of training camp. Despite Wilson’s new contract not ending with him being the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL, it’s a much more comforting difference from the $1.5 million salary he was set to make heading into the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>Wilson is now the second highest-paid quarterback in the NFL behind the Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers with an average salary per year of $17.82 million. Also, his $60 million in guaranteed money is tied for third-most in the NFL among current quarterback contracts behind Pittsburg’s Ben Roethlisberger and San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While on paper Wilson is set to make more than half the amount of money his contract entitles, that guaranteed money doesn’t fully become his just yet.</p>\n<p>Of the $60 million Wilson plans on making in guaranteed money, only the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/russell-wilson-contract-guarantees-2015-8\">first year of his four-year contract</a>–$31.7 million, is fully guaranteed. The total of $31. 7 million stems from a $31 million signing bonus and $700 thousand base salary.</p>\n<p>With the rest of Wilson’s contract depending on his future as the Seahawk’s quarterback, it’s assumed that he will definitely remain in Seattle and collect the money he is owed.</p>\n<p>As Seattle tries to retain as many of its primary impact players that have helped the Seahawks get to two consecutive Super Bowls, not giving Wilson the top notch contract he wanted is just fine.</p>\n<p>With the Seahawks salary cap already spent on keeping players such as Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Marshawn Lynch, and recently Bobby Wagner, now the NFL’s highest-paid middle linebacker after signing a four-year extension worth $43 million ($22 million guaranteed), <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/08/03/seahawks-cant-pay-many-any-more-guys/\">Seattle can only spend so much on players it plans on keeping for the future.</a></p>\n<p>While Seattle may have thought it was done handing out contract extensions, star safety Kam Chancellor is currently holding out from training camp in search of more money. After signing a contract extension with the Seahawks in 2013 worth $35 million for five-years, Chancellor is scheduled to make a base salary of $4.55 million this season.</p>\n<p>In the midst of negotiating player contracts, Seattle has begun its process of releasing players in order to increase salary cap space. Surprisingly, starting defensive tackle Tony McDaniel was released and it’s expected that the Seahawks will probably cut more players and search for cheaper talent. Although McDaniel has been a pivotal piece of Seattle’s defensive front, it’s amazing to see how the business of professional sports outweighs performance sometimes.</p>\n<p>Situations such as Chancellor’s and various others that have decided to hold out are examples of why players have voiced their opinions in the past. In regard to contracts, with the NFL being one of the nation’s top sports industries, players believe that they deserve the guaranteed money and leverage when negotiating that NBA and MLB players have.</p>\n<p>For instance, back in May Minnesota Vikings’ running back Adrian Peterson stated his <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/adrian-peterson-twitter-4\">frustration of franchises having control over player contracts. </a></p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how things pan out between Chancellor and the Seahawks. At the end of the day, Seattle’s effort and success to maintain key pieces must be applauded. However, is it too concerned with keeping its best players and ignoring the possibility of underpaying its role players?</p>\n<p>No one knows what Seattle’s next decision concerning its roster</p>\n<p>will be, but knowing that Wilson will be a Seahawk for years to come is the team’s biggest win so far this offseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dominating Japan in the final round gave the USWNT its third World Cup to add to its already decorated history that includes four gold medals and one silver medal in the five Olympics it has competed in.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This invincible team that has sat atop the throne for years has set all the records when it comes to stats, but the records it broke in this year’s World Cup could benefit more than just the team and the sport. During the final, a total of 30.9 million people tuned in to watch the match. An average of 25.4 million Fox Sports viewers in the U.S. watched the tournament in its entirety, according to Nielsen ratings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">These numbers shatter the record that was set by the 2014 Men’s FIFA World Cup and are well above the viewership of the recent NBA Finals, Stanley Cup and World Series.

This push has been slowly accelerating since the new millennium, and this newfound attention to women’s sports could be the evidence of its success.

Sportscaster Bob Costas has gone so far as to call it a “crass exploitation play,” an effort by ESPN to increase its viewership. Let’s not forget that Caitlyn once stood atop the sporting world by winning the gold medal for the decathlon way back in the 1976 Summer Olympics. Just because she has since come out publically with her true identity, this doesn’t take away from the fact that she is as much a historical sports figure as she ever was and as deserving of the award as anyone.

This Vegas showcase is where college rookies take center stage and prove to GMs why they deserve a shot to be in the pros. But this summer wasn’t all about the players — it was also about a coach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Becky Hammon led the San Antonio Spurs to their first summer league championship as the first female head coach in NBA history. In a dogfight against the Phoenix Suns with over 80,000 fans in attendance, it was Hammon’s coaching and poise that led her Spurs to a dramatic 93-90 victory.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Following 15 years in the WNBA, Hammon decided to put her pro career aside and do something no other female would dare try: join the NBA. On Aug. 5, 2014 the San Antonio Spurs hired Hammon as the first-ever female assistant coach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Under the wing of mentor Gregg Popovich, the former San Antonio Star learned the ropes of the NBA very quickly. The torch was passed this summer as she took over the men’s summer league team and she didn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hammon’s journey to the NBA has been remarkable. From being an undrafted rookie in the WNBA to her six all-star appearances in the league and now having a Summer League title under her belt, critics can only applaud her accomplishments. But her job is not done yet.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For now, it’s safe to say that Becky Hammon has a heart of a champion, breaking barriers not only for herself, but for women everywhere.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64410\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Serena.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1942169891\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64410\" data-attachment-id=\"64410\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/celebrities-at-wimbledon-2015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Serena.jpg?fit=636%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"636,421\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;WireImage&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 11:  Serena Williams of the United States celebrates with the Venus Rosewater Dish after her victory in the Final Of The Ladies' Singles against Garbine Muguruza of Spain during day twelve of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships at Wimbledon on July 11, 2015 in London, England.

But at the age of 33, Serena Williams remains one of the most dominant athletes in the world. On July 11, Williams heightened her prominence atop women’s tennis by earning her 21st Grand Slam victory at Wimbledon.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As Williams’ name continues to ascend in the record books amongst the legendary careers of players such as Germany’s Steffi Graf and Australia’s Margaret Smith Court, the nation’s No. 1 player recreated her own history with the win.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It had been 12 years since she achieved her first “Serena Slam,” but after winning at Wimbledon, Williams repeated the feat of being tennis’ ultimate winner. This year’s “Serena Slam” is the second time in Williams’s career that she is the current champion of each of the four Grand Slam events. Also, the victory at Wimbledon made Williams the oldest women’s tennis player to win a Grand Slam event.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, you may be questioning what is left for Williams to conquer in the latter years of her career, but the answer is simple: to win. Besides being just one win away from tying Graff’s record of 22 Grand Slam titles, Williams is on the verge of achieving a task she never has before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nearly a month away from its arrival in September, the U.S. Open is the next major event that Williams is scheduled to play in. A win in this event would not only award Williams with her seventh U.S. Open, but it would place her on women’s tennis’ most prestigious platform. Williams would become just the second player to win each of the Grand Slam events in the same calendar year, Graf being the first.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64411\" style=\"width: 273px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pierre.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1526036065\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64411\" data-attachment-id=\"64411\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/pierre/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pierre.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Tim Heitman\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D X\",\"caption\":\"Sep 8, 2013; Arlington, TX, USA;  New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul (90) on the sidelines during the fourth quarter of the game against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&amp;T Stadium.

Players have gone as far as to donate thousands of dollars in support of researching the best protective gear and, in some cases, even sued their respective leagues for the unfortunate outcomes that are connected to physical activity in their sport of play. It seems as if most athletes take their own safety into heavy consideration when on the field of play, so it is very surprising to hear of acts where athletes fail to display this attention when off the field.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Just this past Independence Day, NFL players Jason Pierre-Paul of the New York Giants and CJ Wilson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers both suffered finger amputations due to injuries sustained during separate firework accidents. Pierre-Paul lost his right index finger while Watson lost both his right index and middle fingers. Given their defensive positions, these injuries have proven to be career-altering. Pierre-Paul, who was franchise tagged, but hoping to earn a long-term deal instead, lost his opportunity of the desired deal just hours after the accident. Moreover, Wilson’s incident led him to recently retire with hopes of returning to the NFL once recovered and healthy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It is hard to understand how these players, who are concerned with safety so much in the game, can sometimes be very careless outside of it. Both of these men make a living using their hands, and their actions could have cost their teams, families and themselves a lot more. Although this may be the most severe occurrence in outside injuries, this is not the only example. We can point to Andrew Bynum who missed an entire season with the Philadelphia 76ers after hurting his leg bowling. Or Rory Mcllroy, who just missed the British Open due to a ruptured Achilles he got while playing soccer.

While his efforts didn’t land him a spot on an NBA roster for the upcoming season, he recently made the announcement that he is heading overseas to play for the Qingdao Double Star Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"934974252\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64414\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/deandre/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?fit=590%2C354&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"590,354\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deandre\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?fit=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?fit=590%2C354&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-64414\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?resize=282%2C169\" alt=\"deandre\" width=\"282\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?w=590&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?resize=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>DeAndre Jordan Agrees to Contract with Mavs … But Re-Signs with Clips? </strong>by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With a max contract all but signed, center DeAndre Jordan seemed to finally have what he wanted with intentions of joining the Dallas Mavericks. It left Los Angeles Clippers fans startled by the fact that their star center was off to Dallas to clean up boards for their conference rivals.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But as the days passed and rumors swirled about the potential return of Jordan to L.A., the tables turned against Mavericks fans which made the hearts of Clippers fans swell with joy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For the last seven seasons, the athletic Jordan has filled highlight reels and been a driving force behind the birth of “Lob City.” His defense and rebounding are irreplaceable and it was hard to imagine a title run without “DJ” in the mix.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Suddenly, the urgent scramble to lure Jordan back to L.A. led Clippers players, owners and coaches to “camp out” at Jordan’s Houston home until the moratorium period ended.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Before anyone knew it, the weirdest offseason situation in recent memory ended with DeAndre Jordan returning to Los Angeles and leaving Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and fans with a bitter taste in their mouths.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Although this may be one of the most surprising free agency scandals ever witnessed, one thing is for sure: The Clippers are loaded, and Lob City will be in full effect this season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>NFL Offseason’s Biggest Moves </strong>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an offseason that is crowded by suspensions and lawsuits, the actual trades and pickups being made by NFL teams have been deflated in media coverage to this point. This has definitely been unfortunate due to the fact that this offseason has been very exciting for many players and a couple of teams in particular.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Indianapolis Colts, who already have one of the best quarterbacks in the league, a strong defense and a great group of receivers, added some phenomenal pieces to complete their all-star caliber team. This season, Frank Gore and Andre Johnson will suit up in blue to revamp an already potent offense. In addition, the Colts got more protection for Andrew Luck in Todd Herremans and added savvy veterans in Kendall Langford and Trent Cole to their defense. Simply put, Indianapolis is deserving of being one of Vegas’s Super Bowl winning predictions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Buffalo Bills have become very intriguing with their pickups that include new Head Coach Rex Ryan and a defense he is building for himself. With LeSean “Shady” McCoy on board, the Bills have a very exciting offense that could possibly shock many with quarterback Matt Cassel being the team’s possible starter. Quite honestly, Buffalo will be just as hit-or-miss as the team McCoy came from.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Chip Kelly has set himself up to be either the biggest hero or the biggest bonehead in Philadelphia Eagles history. He has completely redesigned a team that had a 10-6 record under Mark Sanchez last year. Only time will tell if Chip is impulsive or wise in moves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the individual side, Ndamukong Suh and Jimmy Graham have made the biggest moves, racking up some cash along the way. Suh moved to the Dolphins and became the highest paid non-quarterback in the NFL as Graham joined the Seattle Seahawks. It’s too bad the Seahawks didn’t have Graham for that last red zone pass … just maybe, things would have ended differently.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Sepp Blatter Finally Gets the Boot </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Well, it’s about damn time. After FBI investigators finally stepped in to take a look at the blatant corruption taking place within the soccer world, Sepp Blatter was finally forced to step down as FIFA president in early June. Maybe we won’t have the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after all. Good riddance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>College Football Playoffs Part II</strong> by Elliot Thornton</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2014, a new era of college football was born with the College Football Playoffs. After a back-and-forth battle between the top two teams, the Ohio State Buckeyes and Oregon Ducks, the second-half surge of running back Ezekiel Elliott sealed the deal for the Buckeyes and crowned them the first ever College Football Playoff champions with a 42-20 victory.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But as last season is put to rest and a new season approaches, all eyes are on Head Coach Urban Meyer and his crew to prove themselves against the toughest competition in the nation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Among these teams lies the rolling Alabama Crimson Tide. After a 35-42 upset and a long ride back to Tuscaloosa, Head Coach Nick Saban and his men stored that bitter loss to Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl in their memory and are out for vengeance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While losing a couple key pieces from their run to the championship game last year, like quarterback Blake Sims, running back T.J. Yeldon and star wideout Amari Cooper, younger talent has emerged and is ready to step up.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Derrick Henry hopes to be the primary weapon for the Crimson Tide offense. The junior running back took 170 handoffs behind Yeldon last year and averaged a staggering 5.8 yards per carry. Henry also led the team in rushing with 990 yards and broke the plane 11 times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With a 6’3″ 240 lb frame, Henry will be a valuable asset to Saban and his dominant offensive line.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another team on the rise is Bama rival, the Auburn Tigers. With the departure of quarterback Nick Marshall to the NFL draft, expectations are high for Head Coach Gus Malzahn and his new team.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The sky is the limit for quarterback Jeremy Johnson. The junior impressed scouts in the Auburn spring game on July 19th, passing for 252 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While Auburn’s defense is a concern on the back end and the timetable of injured lineman Carl Lawson is still questionable, there is no doubt that the Tigers will make a solid run in the talented SEC.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Clippers Going All-In With Championship-or-Bust Mentality </strong>by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sixteen NBA championships have been won in the city of Los Angeles; however, none of them belong to the Clippers. Still, the momentum has clearly shifted the last few years as the Clippers have won 50-plus games for the past three consecutive seasons while the Lakers have had some of their worst seasons in franchise history.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With hopes of winning their first championship in team history, this offseason has shown that “Lob City” will do whatever it takes to win it all. After a disappointing loss to the Houston Rockets in the second round of the NBA Playoffs, (as a life-long Clippers fan this still pains me to write) the Clippers took the “if you can’t beat them, sign them” approach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Clippers added NBA veterans Josh Smith and Pablo Prigioni, both members of the Rockets this past season, to provide some much-needed depth to a bench that was highly criticized throughout the year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Smith is the much more talented of the two, and will undoubtedly contribute more. Nonetheless, Prigioni’s defense and energy off the bench will be huge down the stretch when an aging Chris Paul needs a few extra minutes on the bench.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Los Angeles’ other two moves earlier in the offseason highlighted the “championship or bust” mentality they are taking into this season. The Clippers added fiery guard Lance Stephenson in a trade that sent Matt Barnes to Charlotte, who is now with the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Stephenson is most commonly known for blowing in LeBron James’ ear when the Pacers played the Heat in the 2014 Eastern Conference Finals. But what people do not remember is how well Stephenson played LeBron defensively. He will be able to match up with the best players’ night in and night out, which will be huge on decreasing the minutes for players like Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and the Clippers’ final offseason addition, Paul Pierce.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ten-time all-star is reuniting with his former Head Coach Doc Rivers, whom he won a championship with in Boston back in 2008. While he is in the twilight of his career, Pierce’s finals experience and clutch scoring are still prevalent and can provide a huge boost for the Clippers if they make it deep into the postseason.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Team USA Finishes Fourth in Gold Cup </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Defending champion team USA had been to the Gold Cup Final every time since 2003. A 2-1 loss on home soil to Jamaica in this year’s semis was a huge step back for a team that has been on the rise.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Other Major NBA Storylines…</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Lakers draft D’Angelo Russell No. 2 overall over Jahlil Okafor</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">LaMarcus Aldridge signs with Spurs for four years, $80 million</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Kevin Love re-signs with Cavs for five years, $110 million</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Cueto is a rental player who will be too expensive for Kansas City to keep at the end of the season, but the Royals have the potential to go back to the World Series again this year, so they knew it was their time to make a splash at the trade deadline for arguably the best pitcher available.</p>\n<p>Other trades of note include starting pitcher Scott Kazmir going from the Oakland Athletics to the Houston Astros, who are still surprising many critics who did not believe this young team would be ready to compete for a couple more years.  Outfielder Shane Victorino is now an Angel, reliever Tyler Clippard a Met, and Jose Reyes is a Rockie.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With two wildcard spots in each league, there are so many more teams in the hunt for a playoff spot, making it harder for teams to call themselves sellers. The Cubs, Mets, Giants, and Pirates are all contenders in the National League, and it will be entertaining to see which of these teams makes the biggest move to try and win a place in the wildcard game. Expect the Chicago Cubs to do something big this week, working a trade for either David Price or Cole Hamels, the two top remaining starters on the market.</p>\n<p>In the American League, the Toronto Blue Jays need pitching in order to give themselves a chance at a playoff spot, something they haven’t achieved since they won consecutive World Series titles in 1992-1993. This team has the best offense in baseball, but the eighth worst pitching staff. After picking up Troy Tulowitzki from Colorado, look for Toronto to pick up the White Sox’ ace Jeff Samardzija to bolster its pitching staff.</p>\n<p>Looking at the rest of the AL, the Minnesota Twins have to make a trade if they want to have a chance at making the playoffs. This team is a head-scratcher and I’m surprised they are in the position they are in, but if they don’t trade for a bat like the Padres’ Justin Upton, the Twins will fall out of the playoff race soon.</p>\n<p>With not many hours left, hopefully your favorite team’s general manager doesn’t doze off and miss the opportunity to get your team to the promise land.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Currently, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is the next candidate in line for a major payday. While some may disagree, Wilson seems to be the ideal frontrunner for young quarterbacks on the brink of sealing the coveted “elite” label.</p>\n<p>Constant speculation of the contract negotiations between Wilson and the Seahawks have generated the possibility of him becoming the highest-paid player in the NFL. Despite being drafted as the 75<sup>th</sup> pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft in which five different quarterbacks were drafted before him, Wilson has proved that he belongs and can survive in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Of that 2012 draft class, Wilson, Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Tannehill are the only names of quarterbacks that are still prevalent within NFL storylines. While Luck was the No. 1 overall draft pick and first quarterback off the board, Wilson has had the most success out of the 2012 draftees.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Entering the final year of his rookie contract with a set salary of $1.5 million, the Seahawks’ field general is well deserving of a multi-year contract that could make him the NFL’s richest man. With quarterbacks like Cam Newton, Tannehill, RG3 earning contract extensions, and Luck with plans of receiving a surplus of money, the legendary slogan of “numbers never lie” is the one thing that separates Wilson from the rest.</p>\n<p>Since entering the league in 2012, Wilson’s 36 regular-season wins are the most by any quarterback in his first three seasons, he has an NFL-high 15 fourth quarter/comeback victories, and helped lead Seattle to its first Super Bowl win in franchise history out of two consecutive championship trips.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversial play call that resulted with a game-winning interception by Malcolm Butler to secure the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory, it is inevitable that Wilson has completely transformed the Seahawks from being a below average team into a consistent postseason contender. Prior to Wilson’s arrival, Seattle had not won a playoff game since its upset victory versus the New Orleans Saints in 2010.</p>\n<p>Besides proving himself as a quarterback capable of competing and winning at the NFL level, Wilson’s dual-threat skillset is another viable attribute that must be valued during contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>His combination of being an efficient pocket passer and his playmaking abilities when on the run are what have allowed him to become one of the NFL’s current best quarterbacks. While injuries have plagued the former 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year in RG3 and Newton possessing these same dual-threat talents, Wilson has perfected the balance between passing and rushing the ball. While the numbers may not show significant changes, Wilson has gradually improved each season in both statistical categories.</p>\n<p>However, while Wilson’s performance has been the primary drive behind the Seahawks’ resurgence, the supporting cast of having the NFL’s best defense and arguably best running back in Marshawn Lynch are factors that lead to Seattle’s caution when negotiating the quarterback’s long-term contract.</p>\n<p>Whenever Wilson has been unable to produce for Seattle offensively, it has been the Seahawks defense that has carried the load. Primarily led by original “Legion of Boom” members such as Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas III, the Seahawks defense has consistently ranked amongst the top in points, passing, rushing, and total yards allowed.</p>\n<p>Commonly known for his “Beastmode” moniker, Lynch’s downhill, gritty running style has definitely made Wilson’s quarterbacking job a lot easier. Despite a slow start to his first year as a Seahawk in 2010, Lynch has rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his last four seasons.  He tied for an NFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns and finished fifth in total rushing yards with 1,306 this past season.</p>\n<p>The fact that Wilson has yet to throw 30-plus touchdown passes or break the 4,000 yard mark for passing in his career may be alarming for some, but it doesn’t mean the man doesn’t deserve his money. With the addition of tight-end Jimmy Graham, Wilson has another weapon in his arsenal that can help elevate his stature on the field.</p>\n<p>While some may not even consider him to be a top-five NFL quarterback, Wilson has undoubtedly helped turn Seattle into a winning organization. At the end of the day, the Seahawks must realize how valuable of a steal Wilson has been since his arrival in Seattle and can show their appreciation for him with a new contract this offseason.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/","id":3280,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3279,3278,3277],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Packer Nation Welcomes Favre With Open Arms","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Brett Favre's unforeseen return to Green Bay comes true ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_64341\" style=\"width: 414px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"111848347\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64339\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64341\" data-attachment-id=\"64341\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-22/packer-nation-welcomes-favre-with-open-arms/favre/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?fit=400%2C260&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,260\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"favre\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?fit=400%2C260&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64341\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?resize=404%2C262\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of kenoshanews.com\" width=\"404\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of kenoshanews.com</p></div>\n<p>Brett Favre never thought this day would occur.

After being drafted in the second round and spending just one season with the Atlanta Falcons, Favre found a home in the city of Green Bay after being He was traded from Atlanta to Green Bay in 1992.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t long until the quarterback from Southern Mississippi made his mark on the Packer team and steered their struggling franchise back in the right direction.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to the Favre era, the Packers had only two playoff appearances under their belt since their run with the great Vince Lombardi. A plague of losing seasons overtook the franchise and changes were made with the hiring of Head Coach Mike Holmgren. With a new coaching staff in place and a gun-slinging quarterback at the helm in Brett Favre, the Packers brought back a competitive spirit to their hometown.</p>\n<p>Green Bay made its first postseason appearance since 1983 after the quarterback’s arrival. Favre led the Packers to a total of 11 playoff runs, finishing with the record for most passing yards, touchdowns, and pass completions in team history.</p>\n<p>With this type of resume, not to mention a record of 160 wins as a Packer, Favre rightfully deserves a seat next to the yellow and green greats.</p>\n<p>Brett Favre is one of six Packers ever to have a banner hanging in Lambeau Field. With a stadium that features some of the greatest football athletes to play the game like Bart Starr, Reggie White, and football mastermind Vince Lombardi, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13280080/brett-favre-humbled-fan-response-green-bay-packers-hall-fame-induction\">“It’s quite an honor”, Favre said. “When you look at the players that go into this [category] and to be a part of that it’s hard to put into words.”</a></p>\n<p>Favre’s sixteen years of two minute drives, Super Bowl runs, and “Lambeau leaps” as a Packer outweigh his decision of exiting retirement and joining the rival Vikings. Sure some hearts were broken since his seven-year split with the team, but from this moment on that is water under the bridge. Favre’s return brings him back to his true home and his remembrance in Green Bay will forever be a grateful one.</p>\n<p>While the fans pay tribute to his career in a green and yellow uniform, it is Favre himself who is really saying thank you. The three NFL MVP awards, Superbowl XXXI ring, and career in the NFL are accredited to the loyal fans of Wisconsin and their support throughout the years. Through triumph and adversity, they stuck with the Southern quarterback from Gulfport, Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Brett Favre has accomplished many milestones since his start in the NFL. The 19-year veteran has surpassed greats in records, been at the highest pinnacle of football, and distinguished himself as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever step foot on a field. But having his No. 4 jersey hung up in Lambeau has to be the sweetest victory of all. After facing boos and chants of “traitor” while being a Jet and Viking, Favre assumed that would be the end of his journey in Green Bay. But last Saturday surely put his fears to rest as his journey lives on as a Packer. From this day on he will never be forgotten as one. The induction ceremony was a day full of the cheers and chants that Favre had become accustomed to while in Green Bay. With that entrance and induction, the Packer legend explained, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13280080/brett-favre-humbled-fan-response-green-bay-packers-hall-fame-induction\">“it was like I never left.”</a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-22/packer-nation-welcomes-favre-with-open-arms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-22/packer-nation-welcomes-favre-with-open-arms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-22/packer-nation-welcomes-favre-with-open-arms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-22/packer-nation-welcomes-favre-with-open-arms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-22/packer-nation-welcomes-favre-with-open-arms/","id":3282,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3281,3280,3279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"USMNT on the Rise After Winning Group A","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the heels of the USWNT's World Cup victory over Japan, the men are making their mark in the Gold Cup","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_64313\" style=\"width: 806px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bradley.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1116375933\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64311\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64313\" data-attachment-id=\"64313\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/bradley/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bradley.jpg?fit=640%2C430&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,430\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bradley\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bradley.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bradley.jpg?fit=640%2C430&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64313\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bradley.jpg?resize=796%2C535\" alt=\"bradley\" width=\"796\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bradley.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bradley.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64313\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of reviewjournal.com</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The US Men’s National Team clinched first place in Group A of the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup with a 1-0 victory against Haiti last Friday.

Will they be able to rise to the occasion and make a run for the next world cup?</p>\n<p>After a disappointing loss to Belgium in the round of 16, Head Coach Jurgen Klinsmann and his team are focused for the upcoming opportunity. Although a young team lacking veteran leadership following the retirement of Landon Donovan, new faces and talent will step in place as they start their journey to Russia.</p>\n<p>Among these players lies the 23-year old striker Gyasi Zardes. The LA Galaxy forward subbed in the second half for Team USA and within 61-seconds assisted captain Clint Dempsey for the only goal scored in the game. Turns out the bright lights and big stage wasn’t too much for the young soccer player as he shined in the spotlight and continued to be in attack mode for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Dempsey was impressed by Zardes’ play, calling the forward a “dynamic” player that “will play a big part in the national team picture moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Other players on the rise include midfielder Alejandro Bedoya and goalkeeper Brad Guzan. The duo have been two critical components of Team USA’s success, specifically Bedoya’s play during the World Cup in Brazil and Guzan’s time in the Gold Cup since replacing fan favorite Tim Howard.</p>\n<p>Bedoya’s poise with the ball on the offensive end has been phenomenal. The New Jersey native put perfect placement on the ball for captain Michael Bradley to lock things up in a 1-1 stalemate against Panama on Tuesday. After learning so much in Brazil, Bedoya has stepped up to the plate and become a leader during Team USA’s summer run.</p>\n<p>Guzan has made an impact from the get go since replacing long-time goalie Tim Howard. In the five games that he’s started, the 30-year old has hosted a goal difference of +8, only conceding a total of five goals. Guzan also had seven saves in USA’s victory against Panama Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, it is the combined efforts of role players like Zardes, Bedoya, and Guzan that make the difference and will be the X-factor in giving Team USA a run in 2018. This roster isn’t centered around one major star like a Ronaldo or Messi but consists of a melting pot of role players that can impact the game with full force. If they work together as a unit this team may follow in the footsteps of the great US women’s national team.</p>\n<p>This is a new era for American soccer. After crucial years of tough losses and decisive heartbreakers, the time has come for the US to prove to others that it can be champions on the pitch. Now that the women’s team has done its part, it is up to the men to carry the torch.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/","id":3260,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3259,3258,3257],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Farewell to UCSB, Hello to the Future: Mark Salay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-3-e1436068856898.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-3-e1436068856898.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sports editor Mark Salay gives his goodbyes to UCSB after four great years with Daily Nexus Sports","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_64081\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64081\" data-attachment-id=\"64081\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/farewell-to-ucsb-hello-to-the-future-mark-salay/portraits-print-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-3-e1436068856898.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1433364973\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Portraits Print-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-3-e1436068856898.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-3-e1436068856898.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64081\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-3-1024x684.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64081\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This piece, which I hope you are reading from the print edition rather than online, is my final as sports editor and as an undergraduate. In four years, I have interviewed dozens of disgruntled coaches, attended countless games, sweated over making deadlines and spent far too many long nights in an office with no lights.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Editors at the Nexus come and go as much as the Oakland Raiders change coaches, but sports editor is the one that is always coveted. I had to wait three years for my turn: one year learning the ropes under Brent Pella and Ryan Porush and two more waiting patiently under Paul Michael-Ochoa and Kristen Henneman.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I have seen the paper change a lot in four years. I began when it still printed five days a week, when sports had the front page on Fridays. That changed the following year when we cut back to four days; still, sports had the front page on Thursdays.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It seemed the hemorrhage would stop at three print editions a week, but it didn’t. Going down to one print issue a week this year was a punch to my stomach, seeing something you cared about deeply being gutted. But it was there that we realized we had to be the torchbearers for the next phase of this paper. Collectively, we made strides and made progress in an industry that was changing each day.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Nexus is in good shape, and although we may not print as often, the voice of the student is still alive, the quality of the content remains the same and I will always stand by it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I was blessed to work alongside dedicated individuals who I had the pleasure of calling friends and not just colleagues. I will start with my co-editor Michael Jorgenson, who bailed me out countless times; without your help we wouldn’t have been able to deliver the amount of excellent writing we did this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you to Dustin Harris for delivering us awesome photos all the time and shout out to Liana and Kimberly for being the distraction I sometimes needed in the office. And to Carissa as well for ushering the Nexus into its next phase of life.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My job wouldn’t be possible without a staff of passionate writers working for me. Thank you to Martin Cobos, Sarah Stigers, Daniel Moebus-Bowles, Edward Moss, Jack Mathews and Sean White. Y’all crushed it this year. Sean, I know you will do amazing as next year’s editor.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I also want to acknowledge some of the coaches I got to know over the years beginning with Gregg Wilson, who gave me my first glimpse to UCSB athletics. Thank you to Brie Galicinao, Paul Stumpf, Andrew Checketts and especially to men’s basketball coach Bob Williams for shaping me into a better reporter.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To you, the reader, I am grateful for the support and engagement given to the paper. Overall, it is you that makes the Nexus thrive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">On a more personal note, thank you to my friends and everyone who took the time to read my articles, ask me how the job is going or stopped me and said, “Nice work.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I remember being an 18-year-old, knocking on the Nexus office door and Ryan Porush (sports editor 2011-2012) opening the door asking me if I was there for the orientation. That day started it all. It was here at the Nexus where I learned the little things, saw the importance of journalism and became a better person because of it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Towards the end of my freshman year, I was sitting in the Nexus Sports office next to Brent Pella as he was writing his own editor farewell. He was suffering from writer’s block. I thought to myself, that’s probably going to be me some day. Now that the day has arrived, I’m not sad about it, I’m just glad it actually happened.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of June 4, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily

(Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Junior right-handed pitcher Dillon Tate was a dominating force on the diamond for UCSB baseball. His effectiveness and consistency throughout the season played a major role in the Gaucho’s success. Even with various expectations for his performance, Tate lived up to the hype as he ended the year with an ERA of 2.26, 8 wins, and 111 strikeouts. After having such a miraculous season full of rewards and accolades, he is currently projected to be a first-round pick in the 2015 MLB Draft. If so, Tate will become the first Gaucho in UCSB history to be drafted in the first-round.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Women’s Athlete of the Year: Katie Records (Women’s Swim)</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an exciting season for the UCSB Women’s Swimming team, Katie Records once again led the show and made a name for herself all year. Records received two MPSF Athlete of the Week honors, countless first place victories in her various races, and now is ranked within the Gauchos’ school record books for both singles and relay events. She finished her season with three individual 1st place victories at the MPSF Championships, earning her team 60 points on her own. This tied for the most points by any single athlete and was enough to help UCSB take 3rd place in the Championship meet.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Men’s Team of the Year: Men’s Tennis</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB men’s soccer returned to form this past season with a Big West regular season title and made it all the way to the second round of the NCAA tournament. Santa Barbara had a total of 12 wins on the season, making it the 13th straight year the program has accomplished double-digit wins for a season. The highlights of the team’s year include a 2-0 win against rival Cal Poly on national television and nine players selected to the All-Big West Team.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Women’s Team of the Year: Women’s Tennis</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Representing the ladies, Women’s Tennis takes the cake for Team of the Year, completing the sweep for UCSB tennis. Going 8-3 in conference, the Gauchos finished in second place in the Big West and reached national rankings as high as No. 50. Like the men’s team, the women found some momentum in the second half of the season posting an 11-2 record to close out the year that took it all the way to the final round of the Big West Tournament. Several players were awarded to Big West teams in both singles and doubles, as well as a few honorable mentions.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Coach of the Year: Andrew Checketts (Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Head Coach Andrew Checketts’ devotion to his squad is what paved the way for UCSB baseball’s 40-win season this year. His dedication to make the players and program the best it can be has caught the eye of many within collegiate baseball. Not only did he lead the team to host its first NCAA Regional, but his bid to install new stadium lighting continues his goals of helping UCSB baseball gradually progress as a program. It’s without a doubt that Coach Checketts’ contributions to the UCSB baseball program are unmatched.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Freshmen of the Year: Gabe Vincent (M Basketball), Lou Adler (W Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When Head Coach Bob Williams saw Gabe Vincent play before he committed to UCSB, he knew right away that the freshman recruit would be the Gauchos starting shooting guard. Surely enough, Vincent did not disappoint as he earned Big West Freshman of the Year and was one of four players to average double-digits in scoring with 10.1 points per game. Throughout the season, he showed his ability to take over the game and deliver in the clutch with a game-tying three pointer against Southern Methodist and a game-winning bucket versus Hawaii. With Alan Williams gone, Vincent looks to be the program’s future.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Coming to Santa Barbara, California from her hometown of Vaucresson, France, freshman Lou Adler has had a successful adventure in her first year at UCSB. Despite a mid-season injury, Adler was still able to break into national rankings at No. 93 and end the season on a three-match win streak. She played all of her matches this year for the Gauchos on the number-one ranked court and helped them to a phenomenal season that saw them reach the Big West Tournament Final.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Senior Standouts: Alan Williams (M Basketball), Shelby Wisdom (Softball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite being limited by a shoulder injury for a chunk of the conference season, Alan “Big Al” Williams still managed to be the most dominant big man in the Big West. Big Al earned his third straight Big West First-Team honor and became UCSB’s all-time leader in rebounds along the way. The double-double machine averaged 17.3 points per game and 11.8 rebounds, but it was his tenacity on defense and passing from the post that really separated him from other centers in the country. Big Al’s legendary career as a Gaucho may lead to his name being called in the 2015 NBA Draft on June 25.</p>\n<p>While an injury prevented senior Shelby Wisdom from wreaking havoc on the mound this past season, her UCSB career ends with an undoubtedly remarkable finish. She will leave Santa Barbara with the honors of being named to an All-Conference team in all four of her seasons and ranks within the top-10 of six different statisitcal categories in the Gauchos’ record books. The 2014 season was another milestone filled year as she hit a career-high .304 batting average and became the fourth player in UCSB softball history to hit 10 homeruns in a single season.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Game of the Year: 2/7/15 Men’s Basketball Defeats Hawaii 75-74</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">UCSB trailed by as many as 13 points against Hawaii, but down with five minutes left, the Gauchos hit four straight three pointers to take its first lead of the half. Holding on to a one-point lead with just seconds left, freshman guard Gabe Vincent hit a fade away jump shot to extend UCSB’s lead. Hawaii managed to tie the game with a second left, but upon review, Hawaii’s made three point shot was ruled only a two pointer, giving Santa Barbara a 75-74 comeback win in front of 4,383 fans in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Most Memorable Moment: DePuy Game-Winner (Men’s Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Of midfielder Nick DePuy’s six game-winners this past season, perhaps none was more memorable than his first. With under a minute to go in a 0-0 draw against No. 3 UC Irvine at Harder Stadium, DePuy blasted in an incredible goal from 35-yards out to seal the win and get UCSB off to a perfect 2-0 start in conference play. The goal came in his first start of the season at forward – a position he would remain at for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Story: Andy Perez Loses Redshirt for Injury-Plagued Gauchos (Men’s Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Before the beginning of the 2014 season, midfielder Andy Perez agreed to redshirt for his sophomore year, planning to develop his game more before using up another year of eligibility. However, numerous injuries along with a four-game winless streak had the Gauchos in fear of missing out on the Big West Tournament altogether. With just five games left in the season, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg turned to Perez to fill the void in a vacant midfield, believing that he could be the spark to lift the team to a Big West title. In his first game against Sac St. and in what he called “one of the coolest moments of [his] life,” Perez scored the opening goal, the first in his NCAA career, sparking a run in which UCSB went 3-0-1 to close the season and finish with the best conference record in the Big West.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Breakout Season: Nick DePuy (Men’s Soccer), Cameron Newell (Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nick DePuy didn’t start the year as one of UCSB’s primary offensive targets, but after making the move to forward midway through the season, he quickly proved that he probably should have been there a long time ago. The near-unstoppable forward notched a team-high 10 goals, including an insane six game-winners to lead his team to a No. 1 seed in the Big West Tournament. His performances earned him the honors of Big West Offensive Player of the Year and a pair of National Player of the Week awards.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While many may not have expected his emergence, senior outfielder Cameron Newell led Big West leaderboards all season with a career-best, .368 batting average. He nearly doubled his total hits from last season and hit the only three homers of his Gaucho career during this past season. Newell also became the first Gaucho in team history to win the Big West Field Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Interview: Nathan Eshmade (Men’s Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nathan Eshmade had been on a hot streak at home and had just taken wins in both singles and doubles to secure his team’s victory at a home match that was hosted by a sorority. On being asked if he feeds off of the energy of the home crowd, the Aussie native had this to say. “The crowds are great. I mean you got all these pretty girls out here, calling out to you, so you gotta look at them like, “YEAH!! I just won that point!,” and they yell back and you keep going off of the energy and that really helps us.”</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Looking: Josh Smith (M Swim), Savannah Francis (W Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A member of UCSB’s men’s swimming backstroke unit, junior Josh Smith has earned himself a charming honor. While he has had a great impact on the team with his performance in the pool, Smith’s achievements outside of swimming are impressive as well. He was selected as one of 160 participants to receive an internship at the Cannes Film Festival in France.</p>\n<p>Even when suited up in her women’s soccer uniform, junior defender/forward Savannah Francis is the other enchanting Gaucho to earn this award. Starting in 16 of the Gauchos’ 19 games, Smith ended the year with a total of two goals and one assist.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Most Badass: Morgan Mays (Men’s Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For those of you who wouldn’t think that a tennis player should deserve this award, you have not met Morgan Mays and luckily will probably never have to step foot on a court with him. For if you did, you would be first faced with a 120 MPH serve coming over the net at full force. And, if you were at all blessed to lay your strings on it, you would be faced with an even more deadly line-drive return powered by his aggressive baseliner style. Mays is a Bulldog and he will let you know when he barks at you following every point he slams in your face and onto the concrete. With the thunder that he brings to the court every match, there is no question why the man called “The Beast” is this year’s winner for Most Badass.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A version of this article appeared on pages 10 and 11 of June 4, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/","id":3258,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3257,3256,3255],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Farewell to UCSB, Hello to the Future: Martin Cobos","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-1-e1436068718592.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-1-e1436068718592.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Martin says his goodbyes to the Nexus and UCSB after two great years as a sports staff writer","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_64080\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64080\" data-attachment-id=\"64080\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/farewell-to-ucsb-hello-to-the-future-martin-cobos/portraits-print-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-1-e1436068718592.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1433362759\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Portraits Print-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-1-e1436068718592.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-1-e1436068718592.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64080\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portraits-Print-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Portraits Print-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It has been nothing short of a privilege to cover UCSB athletics for the Daily Nexus. I am beyond thankful that I have had the opportunity to be involved with such a wonderful press.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My four years here as an undergraduate have flown by and with only one week left, I sit in bewilderment pondering where the days have gone.

Who would’ve known that a Lil’ B curse on James Harden would actually send his team packing on a long ride home back to Houston?</p>\n<p>After failing to receive recognition for his cooking celebration dance, the Oakland-based rapper had his revenge Wednesday night as Harden had one of the worst performances of his NBA career. The Rockets’ premiere guard went 2-11 from the field including a playoff record 13 turnovers. After his 45-point outing on Monday, the hard-nosed Warriors’ frontcourt shut down the bearded assassin limiting him to a dismal 14 points. It’s safe to say the potential MVP candidate won’t be doing his infamous “stir the pot” celebration anytime soon.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This Bay Area squad really lived up to the hype and showed why they are the number one team in the West. Dominating on both ends of the floor, the Warriors were hungry for this win diving for loose balls, not giving an inch on the defensive glass and literally ending the series with a bang with a couple high-flying dunks from Harrison Barnes and Andre Iguodala.</p>\n<p>Now the stage is set for the Finals. The high-powered Warrior offense will face off against a Cleveland Cavaliers team with arguably the best athlete of our era in LeBron James. So we know the Warriors are good, we know how talented they are, but do they really stand a chance against the red-hot Cavs?</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down a bit. Heading into the Finals with two series sweeps against the Celtics and the East’s No. 1-seeded Hawks, squad LeBron has walked into the big dance like a breeze. It’s ironic that the former hometown hero that was once despised for abandoning his team has now handed Cleveland a ticket to the Finals. But I’m sure the Akron community isn’t complaining at all.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, the Cavaliers have gotten hot at the right time and they will be a tough matchup for this young Warriors squad. It won’t be any smooth sailing for the Splash Brothers of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson as this Cavs team is stacked with veteran potential that can step into the big moment at any time.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe me? I’ll let the numbers speak for themselves. The Cavs have seven vets who have made it to the NBA Finals at least once for a combined total of 8 NBA championships. Talk about knowing what it takes to win.</p>\n<p>From the reliable shooting of veterans Mike Miller and James Jones, to the streaky guard play of Smith, Shumpert and Dellavedova, to the magician-like performance of Uncle Drew (Kyrie Irving), this disciplined Ohio team can attack you from all angles.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, did I also mention their secret ingredient, LeBron James? A four-time MVP winner, 11-time NBA All-star with two Finals MVP awards and two championship rings. I mean, what more can you ask for?</p>\n<p>This guy has not shied away from the bright lights. In fact, he rather embraces it. He takes command of his team and expects greatness each and every night out of it. His leadership can be a testament to the impressive play of Iman Shumpert and J.R. Smith.</p>\n<p>The former Knicks duo really stepped it up in the previous series against the Hawks, adding a spark on the offensive end that the Cavs lacked. Averaging a combined 30 points per game, Shumpert and Smith have turned it on with the absence of combo forward Kevin Love.  The two will really be the X-factor heading into the Finals.</p>\n<p>So the Cleveland Cavaliers have some quality veterans, a deep bench, and the highest rated player in the 2K videogame on their side. Think it will be an easy sweep in four? Wrong.</p>\n<p>This 67-15 record Warriors club also has some familiarity with winning. Coached by a five-time NBA champion and the point guard alongside the most iconic player to ever step on the court in Michael Jordan, Steve Kerr has done all the right things to get his team to this very moment. I’m sure the former Arizona Wildcat has a few tricks under his sleeve.</p>\n<p>Look for the Curry-Thompson combo to wreak havoc on this Cavaliers team. Arguably the best guard duo to shoot the deep ball, their shooting will be the key to the Warriors’ success if they hope to win.</p>\n<p>I guess having the NBA’s Most Valuable Player on their team also helps out quite a bit, not only making plays for himself but also others around him. The scrappy play of Draymond Green will also be something to look out for, especially against LeBron James. Finally, the young prospect Harrison Barnes will have to embrace a bigger role heading into the biggest series of his life next Thursday. The three-year player had a career-setting performance in Game Five, shooting an efficient 50 percent from the field for 24 points. He’s heading into the Finals with confidence and that’s exactly what his team needs from him.</p>\n<p>The wait is finally over, and basketball’s most iconic series is about to take place. Regardless of matchups, the stats, the wins or losses, this series will definitely be one to remember pairing two of the NBA’s most talented teams in a fight to the finish. As fellow basketball fans, it is time to sit back, relax and let the Finals speak for itself.</p>\n<p><strong>by Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The immensely athletic and dominant player whom they call “The King” has sealed his chance to achieve his childhood dream of bringing a championship home to Cleveland.</p>\n<p>The city itself has never seen an NBA Championship or Super Bowl, and have just one World Series win that took place over 50 years ago. It is without question that a statue of LeBron James will be in our near future if he indeed does complete this fairytale. The real question is whether his streaky teammates will show up or get shown up by a gang of young, hungry ballers.</p>\n<p>With Kevin Love sidelined for the playoffs and Kyrie Irving just hopefully just suiting up in all seven games if necessary, it could come down to players who have recently shown some good signs against a Hawks team that flaunts a solid player at every position. That is why guys like Tristan Thompson and Matt Dellavedova are going to play a key role in this series.</p>\n<p>Delly has been a fun topic in the media lately and, of course, it hasn’t been just because of how well he has played in Irving’s absence. This former Australian football player has made a name for himself for being tough, going all out and, most of all, being disruptive and annoying — just what the Cavs may need to mess up the nearly invincible Golden State team. If Dellavedova gets his minutes, he can provide his style of ball and do Cleveland some good.</p>\n<p>Tristan Thompson, who is nearly averaging a double-double in the playoffs, has shown his worth to this Cleveland line up going toe-to-toe with the likes of Horford and Millsap and coming out pretty successful. He, Perkins and Mozgov are going to have to shut out guys like Bogut and Draymond Green who can ultimately drive the series their way. The defense from these guys down low is going to be challenged as well from everyone on the floor from Curry to Iggy to Harrison Barnes. If the Cavs front court doesn’t provide the necessary help defense and lock up the boards, there could be no help for King James.</p>\n<p>We all know that, despite all these guys on this roster, ultimately, this series will come down to how this man heading into his fifth straight Finals appearance can lead this band of injured misfits to four wins. His will to win a basketball game is like nothing that we have seen in a while and he surely impacts a game more than any other player out there. Let’s also not forget that this is not his first dance, not even in Cleveland, which is more than every player on the Warriors roster can say.</p>\n<p>LeBron’s matchup with First Team All-Defensive player Draymond Green will be one for the cameras to watch carefully since Draymond will probably be more effective than some guy blowing in his ear. We’ve seen what happens when good defenders, like Kawhi Leonard, get to see this guy for multiple games. Some of them start to figure out the puzzle.</p>\n<p>The Warriors have the better team, so LeBron is going to have to add a few more pieces to it if he wants to wear the crown once more — and for the first time at home.  An MVP, his supporting cast and their home court advantage will be waiting to wake him up from this fantasy.</p>\n<p><strong>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of May 28, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/nba-finals-the-bay-takes-on-the-king/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/nba-finals-the-bay-takes-on-the-king/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/nba-finals-the-bay-takes-on-the-king/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/nba-finals-the-bay-takes-on-the-king/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/nba-finals-the-bay-takes-on-the-king/","id":2019,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[2018,2017,2016],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Six Former Gauchos to be Honored on Sunday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Former UCSB players and coaches set to be inducted into the Santa Barbara Basketball Court of Champions ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Willie.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"627515209\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63909\"><img data-attachment-id=\"63914\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/six-former-gauchos-to-be-honored-on-sunday/willie/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Willie.jpg?fit=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"232,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Willie\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Willie.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Willie.jpg?fit=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"  wp-image-63914 alignright\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Willie.jpg?resize=283%2C366\" alt=\"Willie\" width=\"283\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Willie.jpg?w=232&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Willie.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Basketball Court of Champions will be welcoming 17 new inductees this Sunday, May 31 in the second annual hosting of the event.

In 1937, he was hired as head coach of the UCSB men’s basketball team. During his 20-year tenure, Coach Wilton totaled a record of 205-163, which still stands as the best winning percentage by any head coach in UCSB history at .557. Although Wilton has passed on, his children, Mike and Wendy, will accept his induction to the Court of Champions.</p>\n<p>Joining Coach Wilton will be one of his former players from UCSB, Gene Snyder. Following his time as a player, Snyder became one of the most successful basketball coaches in Santa Barbara High School’s history, leading the Dons to a total record of 104-77 in eight seasons.</p>\n<p>Lowell Steward is another former player who will be ushered in with the 2015 class. He became the school’s first African-American captain and helped lead UCSB to the semifinals of the NAIA tournament, where he was not permitted to play due to segregation issues. In late 2014, Steward passed on due to illness. His son Lowell Jr. will accept his induction.</p>\n<p>A UCSB alum as well, Coach Jim Eyan will be the final male inductee. Former assistant coach at Santa Barbara City College for four years and head coach of Dos Pueblos High School for a season, Eyan then served as an assistant coach for five years at UCSB. He then transitioned to the professional level. In his time, he has experienced an NBA finals with the Lakers and two Western Conference Championships with the Trailblazers.</p>\n<p>The Court of Champions will also welcome two women, Cori Close and Barb Beainy, who were teammates on UCSB’s women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>A four-year starting point guard, Close is the first Gaucho to record a career total of 1000 points and 500 assists. After graduating, she went on to become an assistant under UCSB Head Coach Mark French for nine years. As Head Coach of UCLA’s women’s basketball team, Close recently led the Bruins to a championship victory in the WNIT tournament this past season and holds an overall career record of 72-60.</p>\n<p>Close’s former teammate Beainy was awarded Big West Player of the Year and Clutch Player of the Year in 1992, when the team won its first ever Big West title.

Instead, he has remained composed and seems to be committed to improving the future of the NFL. Three rules concerning the distance of the Point After Touchdown, known as the “P.A.T.,” and two-point conversion regulations were adjusted.</p>\n<p>The P.A.T. will no longer be kicked from the two-yard line, but will now be attempted from the 15-yard line. Formerly a 20-yard kicking try, the change in range now sets kickers up with a 32-yard extra-point attempt.</p>\n<p>Still, this adjustment is not a definite change as its success within actual game situations has yet to be tested. The restructuring of the P.A.T. will start off as a one-year trial. Depending on its impact, owners will have the chance to vote for or against the rule in the NFL’s following offseason.</p>\n<p>Finally joining college football in use of the same rule, defenses can now return turnovers that occur during an offense’s two-point conversion attempt for a score of two-points. Since the addition of the two-point conversion to the NFL in 1994, a turnover always resulted in a dead play with no points for the defense. Unchanged is the distance of the two-point conversion as it will remain on the two-yard line.</p>\n<p>Since the two-point conversion is already a short distance away from the end zone, this rule is not problematic. Promoting the use of the two-point conversion should attract more football fans, but making the play easier could potentially become a standard score for offenses.</p>\n<p>While other rule proposals await for team owners to discuss and settle on, these new changes are encouraging in the NFL’s progression.</p>\n<p>The change in the P.A.T. will definitely increase the entertainment level of the sport as kickers will face a more challenging 32-yard attempt. Prior to this rule change, the 20-yard point after effort was a routine score that usually was followed with a commercial.</p>\n<p>The P.A.T. not being an automatic extra point after a team scores a touchdown will make games more intriguing. It forces coaches to make gutsier play calls in crucial, sometimes win or lose situations which allows the game to become more enjoyable for fans.</p>\n<p>Kickers may not appreciate extending the P.A.T. distance now, but it elevates the importance of their position. Kickers are commonly underappreciated due to the fact that they can be replaced so easily, especially when scoring an extra point from the two-yard line is such an effortless task.</p>\n<p>Moving the P.A.T. to the 32-yard line makes the point after attempt more appealing as it increases the amount of pressure on the kicker. It is a chance for kickers to remind everyone of their importance on the field.</p>\n<p>We have all known the two-point conversion attempt to be an unexpected, surprise play call. With these rule changes, does this mean that the anticipation of two-point conversions will possibly detract from its spontaneity? Without a conclusive answer, we will all have to wait and see if the change will help or hurt the game.</p>\n<p>Certainly, giving defenses the opportunity to score off of failed two-point conversion attempts may be the greatest adjustment made. It enhances the intensity of late-game situations in which defenses gain the chance of being game changers. Which is only acceptable since “defense wins championships,” right?</p>\n<p>Imagine a return of an interception, fumble recovery or blocked field goal attempt of a two-point conversion try being the difference in a team winning or sending a game into overtime. These are the types of bizarre scenarios that have given college football a slight entertainment advantage over the NFL. Giving defenses the chance to benefit from causing turnovers is another possibility for the NFL to become more amusing.</p>\n<p>Although many blame Commissioner Goodell for a lack of professionalism and responsibility during the 2014 NFL season, the NFL and NFLPA’s effort to improve the game of football is refreshing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 28, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

That may be the oldest sports cliché in the book; however, it has rung true over and over again as the teams that are playing their best come playoff time tend to fare well and make it the farthest. That trend has not been consistent in the 2015 NHL Playoffs as the season-long juggernauts have flexed their muscles and knocked out some of the hottest teams in the league like the Minnesota Wild and the Ottawa Senators. While the Ducks and the Blackhawks have already wrapped things up out west, the Eastern conference remains up for grabs as the Capitals and the Rangers will need game seven and Carey Price is willing the Canadiens back into Montreal’s series after falling behind 3-0 to Tampa Bay.  Recap:</p>\n<p><b>Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers (Tied 3-3)</b>– Alexander Ovechkin put the Capitals on his back this series and carried them to a 3-1 lead over the Rangers. That is when the offense clicked and a Henrik Lundqvist with his back against the wall is a dangerous Henrik Lundqvist. Two straight wins have tied the series and brought it back to New York for a pivotal game seven. There are so many different factors that will affect Wednesday’s game and it will ultimately become a battle of who shows up and who does not. Braden Holtby has been vulnerable in the last two games, allowing six goals over that span while his offense has provided him only three goals of support; none of those from Alex Ovechkin. While Alex Ovechkin and Henrik Lundqvist headline this series, I believe that it will be up to Braden Holtby and the Capitals defense to shut down the Rangers if they want to have any chance of moving on.</p>\n<p><b>Anaheim Ducks vs. Calgary Flames (Ducks win 4-1)-</b> The Ducks seem to be on a mission this postseason as they overpowered the Flames with size and experience to cruise to a 4-1 series victory. This series taught us a lot about both Anaheim and Calgary. We learned that Anaheim has the depth and high-octane offense to make a serious charge at Chicago next round and reach the Stanley Cup. We also learned that Calgary may not have had the firepower to win this year, but they will be back and back with a vengeance. Johnny Gaudreau looked poised and dangerous after being benched in the second period of game two and the sky is the limit for the rookie. Not to mention its hard not to imagine what this team could have done with a healthy Mark Giordano. Anaheim Head Coach Bruce Boudreau has already pegged Chicago “the fastest team in the NHL”, which is going to test the versatile defense of the Ducks. If Frederik Andersen can match Corey Crawford in goal then the Ducks have a serious chance to take this series.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Nbk86c29uI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><b>Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota Wild (Blackhawks win 4-0)- </b>Just a few weeks ago, no one in their right mind would have chosen Corey Crawford to beat Devan Dubnyk in a goalie battle; however, that was the case in this series as it was all Blackhawks all the time. Crawford was magnificent all series and after being benched in the opening series for Chicago, he made the most of this opportunity giving up only seven goals in four games to a high-powered Minnesota offense. The Wild deserve all the credit in the world for even making it to where they did, as no one expected them to make a charge into the postseason, let alone defeat Stanley Cup favorites St. Louis. That is exactly what Mike Yeo did and with a historic second half of the season for Devan Dubnyk, the Wild were able to dominate the NHL and rapidly climb up the standings. Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville has not been shy in praising the talented Anaheim Ducks and knows that his team will have their hands full in the next round. Patrick Kane is playing like the best player in the posteason right now and if he keeps scoring at his current pace, no one will be able to stop Chicago.</p>\n<p><b>Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Montreal Canadiens (Tampa Bay 3-2)</b>-Fresh off of a bruising seven game series against Detroit, no one expected Tampa Bay to come out and play the way they did against Montreal. The Canadiens had far more rest and still found themselves behind 3-0 to the Lightning and scrambling for answers. Carey Price has been the answer for this team all season long and he has responded with two great games to keep Montreal afloat. The offense of the Canadiens cannot be overlooked as they have scored eight goals in their last two games and seem to be putting things together at the right time. Is it too little too late though? Steven Stamkos and the deadly offense of the Lightning will look to stop their mini-skid and move on to the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday. I believe that the Lightning will wrap it up at home, but if they take it to game seven then they will be in a bad position playing on the road with very little momentum.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/","id":2024,"author":{"id":321,"name":"Jack Mathews"},"related":[2023,2022,2021],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":10,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
