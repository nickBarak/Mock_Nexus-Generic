When faced with adversity he did not find excuses but instead found ways to succeed and win.</p>\n<p>Gaucho alum Bill Geivett recently released his book<em>, Do You Want to Work in Baseball? Inside Baseball Operations,</em> which details his experiences in professional baseball as a player, scout, farm director and front-office executive. In the publication, Geivett’s advice is not only applicable to those who seek a career in sports management, but to anyone competing in any type of job market today as well.</p>\n<p>Geivett played for the Gauchos in 1984 and 1985 and posted monster numbers while in a UCSB uniform. Geivett still holds the school records for career batting average (.402), single season batting average (.412, 1985), hits in a season (100, 1985). He also used to hold records for triples in a season (8, 1985), most runs scored in a season (74, 1985), and most at-bats in a single season (243, 1985).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After previously being drafted four consecutive times by four different organizations, Geivett finally signed with then Anaheim Angels organization in 1985 after being drafted in the 13th round.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Geivett, his baseball-playing career would come to a sudden conclusion due to a knee injury in 1988, but this career ending injury still would not stop Geivett from being a part of baseball. Soon after, Geivett would coach for Loyola Marymount University in 1989 and Long Beach State University in 1990.</p>\n<p>While coaching for college programs added to his already impressive baseball resume, Geivett’s future would still lie in professional baseball with him eventually becoming a scout and instructor in the Yankees organization in 1991.</p>\n<p>From 1994 to 1996, Geivett would be hired as the head farm director for the Montreal Expos. The Expos’ farm system was largely known as one of the best farm systems in baseball during this time due to the tremendous talent in the system that housed big names such as Mark Grudzielanek, Orlando Cabrera, Jose Vidro, Cliff Floyd and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>\n<p>During his time as a farm director, in his book, Geivett recalls an experience he had with a particular player, F.P. Santangelo.</p>\n<p>Jeff Blair from the <em>Montreal Gazette</em> published an article with an inside major league source from the Expos’ organization, stating, “We don’t feel there is anyone in Ottawa [Montreal’s Triple-A affiliate] who can help our team in Montreal.”</p>\n<p>This angered many Ottawa Lynx players, but no more so than it angered Santangelo. After a team meeting, most players had cooled down — but not Santangelo. Santangelo would confront Geivett and insist he is ready to be called up to the big leagues, even though Santangelo was hitting a less than impressive .243 at the time.</p>\n<p>After a roster spot opened up on the big league squad due to an injury, Geivett would take a risk on Santangelo, sending him to the big leagues after Santangelo waited seven years in the minors. Stating he went above several people’s heads in the organization to do this in his memoir, Geivett’s career was on the line with this decision.</p>\n<p>Nervous, Geivett’s worst fear would come true and Santangelo’s name would be penciled in the lineup the first day he arrived in Montreal. Putting all his money on Santangelo, a person who was more confident in his ability than anyone, Geivett would come out on top.</p>\n<p>Santangelo would go on to hit a triple that night and would end up staying in the big leagues for seven years. Geivett stated in his book himself, “It was one of my most emotional experiences in professional baseball watching F.P. slide into third base … F.P. Santangelo taught me the power of confidence.”</p>\n<p>After his time in Montreal, Geivett would become the assistant general manager of the Devil Rays in 1997 and would move on to join the Dodgers in 1998 under the same position.</p>\n<p>While with the Dodgers, Geivett shared another story about college graduates looking for work in professional baseball. At the Baseball Winter Meetings, an event where baseball GMs meet and discuss potential trades, a couple college graduates approached Geivett and Tommy Lasorda with their resumes trying to get hired on the spot for jobs within the organization. Right then and there, both Geivett and Lasorda broke down the flaws in each approach the men had … to their faces.</p>\n<p>When asked about this story when speaking as a special guest for a sports management course here at UCSB, Geivett assured the class to do these three specific things that are reinforced and expanded upon in his book: “Have a specialty. Really know what you’re talking about. Make people aware what you want to do.”</p>\n<p>In 2000, Geivett would land and stick with the Colorado Rockies organization for 14 years, moving from director of player personnel to director of minor league operations to assistant general manager to the team’s director of major-league operations in 2012. After a long career in baseball, Geivett would later resign from this position in 2014.</p>\n<p>Geivett hopes the release of his book will both help and inspire generations of sports managers and people alike, stating, “I’m hopeful that in years to come somebody that reads the book remembers, ‘Hey I remember reading the book and that guy talked about that,’ and the lesson has been passed on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/","id":1898,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

He called it his “home” over and over, and he made it very clear he wanted to retire a King. He wanted his jersey in the rafters.</p>\n<p>Just watch his speech at his Sacramento farewell party on Monday night: he can barely stumble through a few sentences without being overwhelmed with tears. He cried more than I did when I left Sacramento, and I was leaving to go live in a dorm with two other guys. He’s leaving to go live in New Orleans and play with Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p>The Kings finally had a star player who loved Sacramento, and they traded him away. For nothing, I should add. Really, a return of Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, a mid-first round pick and a second round pick for one of the greatest Kings players of all time? That’s insulting.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s not surprising.</p>\n<p>It would have been more surprising had the Kings’ front office managed to get a fair return for Cousins. This is a team that drafted Jimmer Fredette over Klay Thompson and Thomas Robinson over Damian Lillard. They traded Isaiah Thomas, who is currently a top-five MVP candidate, for Alex Oriakhi, who is now a Mexican club league player.</p>\n<p>The last decade of Kings management has been a master class in sheer incompetence.</p>\n<p>So yeah, sure, Cousins never made it to the playoffs and only won more than 30 games once. I consider it half a miracle he even did that, saddled with this front office. Cousins had approximately five halfway decent teammates during his Kings career —Thomas, Evans, Rudy Gay, Darren Collison and Jason Thompson — and never more than three at any one time. LeBron James would struggle to bring teams like Cousins’s to the playoffs.</p>\n<p>I can’t deny the fact that Cousins was a lot — sometimes too much — to handle as a teammate and a player. He pouted, whined and fought with referees, teammates and coaches. But when you added it all up, his offensive dominance and love for Sacramento outweighed the negatives, plentiful as they were.</p>\n<p>Cousins’s brilliance and loyalty were some of the only on-court bright spots in the last decade of Kings basketball. As long as the Kings had Cousins, Sacramento had something to hope for. He was evidence that sometimes the front office could succeed in spite of itself.</p>\n<p>That’s gone now. In the end, not even Cousins could end the torture and escape the incompetence of the Kings. No wonder my brother chose to be a Warriors fan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Now define the term “tradition” and the same process follows a loose-ended description of carrying on beliefs from one generation to the next.</p>\n<p>We’ve seen moments in sports where the two components infuse together and create a masterpiece. The Brady-Belichick era, the John Wooden dynasty, the “Core Four” Yankees and more are all relevant examples that permeate the mind when it comes to building a tradition of success.</p>\n<p>But what about the teams that don’t get the same spotlight as these prominent professional dynasties but still deserve to be in this conversation of greatness? Are there other cases of success and tradition that move beyond the noteworthy teams we have come to know and praise? This is the case for Head Coach Geno Auriemma and the UConn Huskies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Achieving success has never been an easy feat when it comes to any sport, but for Auriemma, it has evolved into a fundamental piece of his program. The American Athletic Conference coach has a proven winner with 979 career wins, 28 NCAA Tournament appearances and 11 national championship titles under his belt.</p>\n<p>Just as of Monday night, Auriemma and the Huskies’ program made history by winning their 100th-straight game, which continued UCONN’s longest streak in NCAA basketball history ever.</p>\n<p>The Huskies took down South Carolina 66-55 Monday night. Securing their niche in history, Auriemma and his Huskies continue to reinvent a culture of basketball that is the epitome of longevity for over two decades as the result of one element: winning.</p>\n<p>During his 22 years in Connecticut, Auriemma has crafted some of the finest female athletes to ever hit the hardwood floor. His ability to develop players and help them reach the next level has helped create four Rookie of the Year award winners, nine All-Stars and 12 WNBA champions over the span of 18 years.</p>\n<p>Stars such as Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, and Maya Moore flourished during their collegiate time in Harry A. Gampel Pavilion and under Auriemma, but more importantly, they’ve been able to transfer a winning culture over to their respective WNBA teams.</p>\n<p>As a result, there is no doubt the Huskies’ 2006 enshrinement into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame was well beyond well-deserved. However, the problem remains that Auriemma continues to be overshadowed by the celebrated teams of professional sports.</p>\n<p>Is there a reason the eight-time AP Coach of the Year lacks recognition when commemorating current coaching legends like Gregg Popovich and Belichick? Could this lack of appreciation be due to the polarized attitudes toward intercollegiate athletics and women’s sports? Whatever the case may be, Auriemma has accomplished multiple achievements, specifically his most recent, that are worthy of some praise.</p>\n<p>In an interview with “Good Morning America” co-host Robin Roberts, Auriemma stated, “I try to tell these kids they’re already part of history. No one can ever take that away from them, and all they can do is continue to add to it.”</p>\n<p>Numbers and accolades only paint a small portion of the picture for Geno Auriemma. As a man with excellence at the core of his program, Auriemma can be reasonably justified as his own placement as one of the greatest coach’s in sports history ever.</p>\n<p>His presence as a teacher and role model is one that uniquely connects with a younger generation of college athletes striving to create their own legacy of dominance.</p>\n<p>Auriemma’s time at UConn and current 100-game win streak for the school will be internalized as an unforgettable moment in sports. His efforts stand as a reflection, revision, and redefinition of what a “winning tradition” consists of. Success and tradition can come in many forms; this year’s Huskies are proof of that.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/","id":3359,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3358,3357,3356],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl LI Key Matchups: Offense, Defense, Special Teams Pt. 2","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sportsball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sportsball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Daily Nexus Sports staff was assigned different key matchups that could have a profound impact on the outcome of Sunday's Super Bowl game.

A primetime matchup that often gets overlooked is set to happen in the trenches themselves, primarily revolving around the Falcons defensive line vs. the Patriots offensive line.</p>\n<p>Although not much credit is given regarding their offensive line, the Patriots have been much improved this season after an atrocious 2015-16 season. Much of this credit should be given to offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who has really turned this group around. Left tackle Nate Solder holds the fort down for QB Tom Brady, while Marcus Cannon solidifies the run game on the right side. Joe Thuney, David Andrews and Shaq Mason shore up the middle of the 10th best O-Line in the NFL via <em>Profootballfocus.com</em>.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although the Pats rank seventh among postseason teams in rushing with a modest 2.9 yards per rush, they rank second in passing with an average of 326.5 yards per game. These averages are the outcome of a sturdy offensive line that is healthy. For any quarterback, being provided time in the pocket is key, but it becomes even more advantageous for a quarterback such as Brady, who they protected well with the fifth best ranking in sacks allowed at 24.</p>\n<p>Opposite the line of scrimmage is the Atlanta Falcons, who are an elusive and strong front. This is despite the fact that they rank sixth and seventh in rush and pass defense, respectively, during the playoffs; the Falcons are giving up 5.3 yards per rush to opposing teams, but only 6.8 yards per pass.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in an average of 20.5 points allowed per game; however, Vic Beasley Jr., Jonathan Babineaux, Tyson Jackson, Dwight Freeney and Co. are going to try and limit Brady and the Patriots. They have achieved their average the past two games, but the Patriots’ offense is explosive, and this D-Line may have to battle in a game that could possibly lead to a shootout.</p>\n<p>But don’t count the Falcons out just yet. All eyes will be on Beasley Jr. after he ended the season with a league-leading 15.5 sacks.</p>\n<p>Super Bowl 51 is set to be a great one, with anticipation of a high scoring, offensively charged game that could get out of hand on the scoreboard. The matchup seems sized up to be a battle in the trenches, and it could be a result of which line is willing to push a little harder to obtain the coveted Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Defense by Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>An old mantra of the NFL has been that “defense wins championships.” That hypothesis can both be supported in this year’s Super Bowl by the Patriots, who concluded the regular season with 5,223 yards allowed, the eighth fewest in the league.</p>\n<p>Yet it can be somewhat rejected, as the team graded out as subpar, finishing 16th in Football Outsiders’ defensive DVOA, known as Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, is a stat that measures the overall efficiency of the defense compared to league average.</p>\n<p>Atlanta is no greater on defense either, finishing the regular season ranked 27th in defensive DVOA, with the 25th defense according to total yards allowed (5,939). The unit has been playing well of late though, giving up 21 and 20 points in their first two playoff games against the Seahawks and Packers, respectively, both of which are teams with high offensive ceilings.</p>\n<p>Vic Beasley Jr. was a monster for the team all year, leading the league with 15.5 sacks. Although he’s yet to notch one in the playoffs thus far, the Falcons have sacked the quarterback five times in the past two games, suggesting Tom Brady will be under pressure all evening.</p>\n<p>In Brady’s two Super Bowl losses, a vicious opposing pass rush has been a common element and figures to be an essential factor in determining Sunday’s outcome.</p>\n<p>Atlanta has shown a penchant for creating chaos this postseason, amassing three interceptions, a forced fumble and a safety. New England has created five turnovers itself during the 2017 playoffs and will need to turn Matt Ryan over once or twice to have a shot at stopping this high-powered Falcons offense.</p>\n<p>The main playmakers in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, wide receiver Julio Jones, quarterback Matt Ryan and the backfield duo of Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman should be eager for a Patriots matchup that could work to their advantage.</p>\n<p>While New England allowed more than 20 points in only three games this regular season, it ranks 20th in defensive DVOA versus both number one receivers and running backs.</p>\n<p>But New England has put together a cohesive group on the defensive side of the ball, though the Patriots are bereft of the defensive superstars that have been a key component in each of Bill Belichick’s Super Bowl winning runs.</p>\n<p>No longer are the Pats depending on impact players such as Chandler Jones and Darrelle Revis from two years ago, who have been replaced by Chris Long and Logan Ryan, and it’s yet to be seen if this group can match up with a team as talented as the Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>I’ll take Brady, though, who has only thrown two interceptions on the year and seems pretty intent on sticking it to Roger Goodell and co.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Backfield by Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>Although it will be only the Falcons’ second ever Super Bowl appearance compared to the Patriots’ record-high 10th, Sunday’s matchup could be thrilling, especially when looking at the Falcons backfield going against the Patriots defense.</p>\n<p>Ranked No. 3 in the NFL when defending against the run, opposing teams only complete 88.6 rushing yards per game on average, making evident the cohesiveness and ability of the Pats’ defensive line. New England has only allowed five rushing touchdowns in 18 games this season, including playoffs, while not allowing a single running back to rush for over 100 yards in a single game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the field, the Atlanta Falcons backfield is No. 4 in the league, averaging 4.6 yards per run. They have managed to score 20 touchdowns off running plays during the regular season but will be challenged by the Patriots’ strong rushing defense.</p>\n<p>Propelling the Falcons’ offense are two particularly strong running backs in Tevin Coleman and Devonta Freeman. Twenty-three-year-old Coleman totaled 520 rushing yards in the regular season, scoring eight rushing touchdowns, averaging 4.4 yards per run and has not slowed his roll since season has ended. Coleman is also a huge threat out of the backfield as receiver where he totaled 421 yards on 31 receptions and added three more touchdowns.</p>\n<p>On 28 total touches this postseason, the Indiana alum has registered 143 total yards (86 yards rushing, 57 receiving) and two touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Teammate Freeman made it past the 1,000-yard mark for the second straight season rushing for a career-high 1,079 yards this year while, adding 11 rushing touchdowns. Like Coleman, Freeman also does a great job as a receiver as he totaled 54 receptions in the regular season for 462 yards and two touchdowns. In two games this season, Freeman rushed for over 100 yards and in both, the Falcons won by an average margin of 20.5 points. In his two postseason games, Freeman has totaled 207 total yards and two touchdowns on 36 touches.</p>\n<p>With experience as well as energy on their side, the Patriots present a strong front that could help lead the team to victory if their defensive ends can cover the outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Offense vs. Falcons Offense by Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>Super Bowl LI has potential to be an offensive clash for the ages, as the Falcons and Patriots, arguably the two best offenses in the NFL, flex their muscles on the biggest stage. Beyond the most notable matchup between perennial champion Tom Brady and veteran Matt Ryan — who has taken his game to a whole new level this season — throwing for a career high 38 TDs, both teams boast a countless number of threats that could make for a memorable game.</p>\n<p>If the defenses show up on their top game as expected, though, the running game will be key in deciding which team controls the tempo. Patriots RB LeGarrette Blount has been having a Super Bowl-worthy season, with 18 regular season TDs, adding one more in his team’s AFC Championship victory over the Steelers.</p>\n<p>His counterpart is no slouch either, as Falcons RB Devonta Freeman enters the title bout with 11 rushing TDs in the regular season while eclipsing 1,000 yards for the second straight season.<br>\nAtlanta heads into the big game with a slight edge in nearly every offensive category, with 295.3 yards in the air per game compared to New England’s 269.3 and 38 passing scores to 32.</p>\n<p>On the ground, the Falcons keep their advantage from their three-pronged running game with 120.5 yards per game and 20 TDs to the Patriots’ 117.0 YPG and 19 TDs.</p>\n<p>The Patriots’ biggest strength lies in their two main receiving targets for Brady, Julian Edelman and Martellus Bennett, who have combined for 1,800 receiving yards and 10 TDs this year, while the former was targeted 158 times, more than twice any other teammate. Matt Ryan’s number one target, Julio Jones, has had years to develop a relationship with his quarterback and the benefits this season were remarkable; Jones gathered over 1,400 receiving yards and seven TDs, averaging just over 100 YPG.</p>\n<p>Both teams have playmakers at every key offensive position and both offensive lines give the quarterbacks enough time to control the game, so the spotlight will obviously be on the two star QBs; that being said, it’ll be up to one of the skill players to come up with a game-winning play in the end.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75402\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/super-bowl-li-key-matchups-offense-defense-special-teams-pt-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75402\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/super-bowl-li-key-matchups-offense-defense-special-teams-pt-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/super-bowl-li-key-matchups-offense-defense-special-teams-pt-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/super-bowl-li-key-matchups-offense-defense-special-teams-pt-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/super-bowl-li-key-matchups-offense-defense-special-teams-pt-2/","id":3341,"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava"},"related":[3340,3339,3338],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Key Matchup: Tom Brady vs. Matt Ryan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/compare.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/compare.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Two of this season's top quarterbacks are set to face each other in Super Bowl LI this Sunday.

No other QB in NFL history has ever achieved this mark, so the experience advantage is definitely in his favor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off his four-game ban at the beginning of the season, Brady’s still managed a record-breaking touchdown to interception ratio. A major key to his team’s success will reside on the backfield’s ability to run after catch on short plays.</p>\n<p>Also, considering he’s missing the best tight-end in the league, Gronkowski, Brady has proven time and time again that he’ll get the job done no matter what. He’s looked as stellar as ever throughout the postseason thus far, and with questions of retirement in the air, one thing is for sure: Brady’s going out with a bang.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Ryan</strong></p>\n<p>Matt Ryan has become the franchise quarterback that Falcons fans have been searching for since Mike Vick. Statistically speaking, Ryan has been ranked top three in almost every QB category this season and has been prepping his game all season long.</p>\n<p>Ryan led the Falcons to break the franchise scoring record during the season. Alongside a very talented backfield, Ryan has found much success on screen plays and the safety valve options his running backs offer, not to mention a receiving corps that has proven to be one of the most potent in the league. With a 117.1 passer rating, on paper, he’s been more productive than his opponent counterpart.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse for future defensive matchups, Ryan is merely 31 years old and is hitting his peak at the perfect time. With two great passing QBs waiting to start in this upcoming Super Bowl, viewers are sure to be in for quite the show.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>New England ended the regular season with 1,872 total rushing yards, 117 rushing yards per game and 19 rushing touchdowns. Each total had a top finish in the league at seventh in total rushing yards, seventh in rushing yards per game and fifth in rushing touchdowns in the league.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Patriots’ backfield has been able to keep up their regular season success in the postseason as they have averaged 77.5 rushing yards per game and have two touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Blount led the league in rushing touchdowns with 18 this year and has one touchdown in the postseason. Blount has served as the go-to back for the Patriots’ offense, but Lewis and White have been able to positively affect the offense with their own unique skill sets.</p>\n<p>Lewis, the smaller scat back, has only gotten better since coming off of an ACL injury earlier in the year and is a big play threat due to his mix of speed, agility, and elusiveness.</p>\n<p>While Blount and Lewis will most likely see a large share of touches, White has proven he can come up clutch in situations when given the chance as well.</p>\n<p>Atlanta’s defense has been below average against the run this year as it allowed 15 rushing touchdowns and 104.5 rushing yards per game, making them 19th in touchdowns allowed and 17th in rushing yards per game. Despite their regular season trouble, the Falcons base nickel defense has not allowed a rushing touchdown this postseason.</p>\n<p>The Falcons’ young defense is looking to continue their success as players like Keanu Neal, Vic Beasley Jr. and Deion Jones are defensive playmakers who can put a dent into the success of the Patriots’ trio of backs. Their defense should be well prepared to try and stop the versatile Patriots backfield.</p>\n<p>However, I feel the Patriots’ amount of offensive weapons in both the pass and rush game will be too much for the Falcons to handle, leaving the opportunity for the New England backfield to shine. I predict the final score will be 31-28, with the Patriots hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats WRs vs. Falcons Secondary by Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>While they might not compare to Atlanta’s stellar duo of Julio Jones and Mohammad Sanu, the New England Patriots’ core of wide receivers can mean the difference in another championship banner or empty-handed defeat approaching this year’s much anticipated Super Bowl matchup.</p>\n<p>Operating under Offensive Coordinator Josh McDaniel and his slot-schemed offense, the Pats’ spread of receivers Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan and Danny Amendola will be a primary concern for a strong and ball-hawking Falcons’ secondary.</p>\n<p>Eight-year veteran and Super Bowl XLIX hero Julian Edelman is the first impact player Head Coach Dan Quinn and his Falcons must attend to. Epitomized for the big moment and for being Tom Brady’s go-to guy in crunch time, Edelman has been known for thriving under pressure and making big plays when it matters.</p>\n<p>His go-ahead grab that put the Patriots up against the Seahawks in the final minute of Super Bowl XLIX is a prime example as well as his eight receptions for 118 yards and one touchdown in the Patriots 36-17 AFC Championship win over the Steelers this postseason.</p>\n<p>Edelman had a solid regular season as well with 98 receptions, and a career-high 1,109 receiving yards as well as hauling in three touchdowns. The eighth-year receiver is also coming off his best year in the postseason, averaging eight catches and 127 yards per game in his games versus the Texans and Steelers.</p>\n<p>Monmouth product Chris Hogan is also another liability on offense for the Falcons. Coming off the game of his career, Hogan has proven to be a target that can catch the deep ball, recording 180 yards and two touchdowns in New England’s match against the Steelers.</p>\n<p>In terms of Atlanta’s defense, the Falcons’ pool of cornerbacks will match up well and pose a big test on New England’s athletic receivers. Corners Robert Alford, Jalen Collins and Brian Poole play an integral part in Atlanta’s coverage scheme. They are able to make the sure tackle and jam up their opponent combining for 28 total tackles and five pass deflections this postseason.</p>\n<p>Safeties Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen serve as the stronghold for the Falcons’ secondary. Neal’s 17 postseason tackles and Allen’s two interceptions lead the team.<br>\nOverall, this matchup between the Patriots’ receivers and Falcons serves as an enticing pair that everyone should keep their eyes on.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Secondary vs. Falcons WRs by Tommy Pardini</strong></p>\n<p>An integral part of the high-powered Atlanta Falcons offense is their solid receiving core led by All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, who is consistently in the conversation for the top wide receiver in the NFL.</p>\n<p>The Falcons’ passing attack through Jones has been killing teams all year long. Just ask the Green Bay Packers, who surrendered 180 receiving yards and two touchdowns to the 6’3” 220-pound beast in the NFC title game.</p>\n<p>Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan loves to move players around in different spots on the field. For example, Jones or receiver Taylor Gabriel will frequently line up out wide by either sideline or in the slot depending on the play.</p>\n<p>This means the defensive unit on the other side of the ball needs to be versatile and intelligent, traits that many New England Patriot players possess.</p>\n<p>The secondary for the Patriots is comprised of Super Bowl veterans like cornerback Malcolm Butler and safeties Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung, who have both played in two Super Bowls. McCourty converted from cornerback to safety a few years back, which is evident with his versatile ability to line up with receivers when need be.</p>\n<p>The New England coaching staff seems to always put their players in positions to succeed. Under Head Coach Bill Belichick, while playing in the postseason, the Patriots have only allowed one playoff touchdown to any first-team All-Pro receiver standing 6 feet or taller (Julio Jones), with the average stat line consisting of about five catches and 62 receiving yards as reported on NESN.com. This includes 19 players’ playoff games from only their All-Pro caliber seasons.</p>\n<p>Over this entire year, Julio Jones is averaging 3.2 yards per route run, which is tops in the NFL by nearly half a yard per ProFootballFocus.com. The versatile Patriots’ secondary will undoubtedly have their hands full. Atlanta’s receiving unit has been tough to handle this season because they come at you in so many ways.</p>\n<p>This fascinating matchup could be a big deciding factor in Super Bowl LI. A great performance from Jones and the rest of the Falcons receivers could give Atlanta their first ever Lombardi Trophy. The reverse would give Brady and Belichick the most Super Bowl victories by a quarterback-coach duo in NFL history.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<p><strong>Pats Special Teams vs. Falcons Special Teams by Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>Heading into this Sunday’s Super Bowl, there’s been a lot of debate about Bill Belichick versus Matt Ryan and Tom Brady versus Vic Beasley Jr. Yet there hasn’t been a whole lot of debate about special teams.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<p>That’s understandable; special teams often receive sort of a “redheaded stepchild” treatment when it comes to sports arguments. Just because it’s understandable, however, doesn’t make that lack of debate any less of a shame.</p>\n<p>Most years, New England’s high ranking would lean heavily on their kicker, four-time Pro Bowler Stephen Gostkowski.</p>\n<p>The 11-year veteran has succeeded for most of his career but experienced early-season struggles during the regular season. He ended with three missed extra points and four missed field goals to accumulate an 84.4 field goal percentage — the lowest in his career since 2012 — making Gostkowski less reliable than usual.</p>\n<p>Matt Bryant, on the other hand, has been nothing but reliable for the Falcons this year. Bryant had the best season of his 15-season career, going 34-37 on field goals and 56-57 on extra points. Simply put, if this game comes down to kicking, Atlanta’s got the edge.</p>\n<p>Kick coverage, on the other hand, is an easy decision.</p>\n<p>The Falcons are one of the worst teams in the league in both kickoff and punt coverage, while the Patriots — led by Matthew Slater and Nate Ebner — keep returners pretty much silent.</p>\n<p>New England’s strong kick coverage will be a crucial key in hindering the high-octane Atlanta offense, while the Falcons might have some trouble keeping the Patriots from enjoying consistently good field position.</p>\n<p>In the end, the pivotal point between these two special teams is the return game. New England has struggled to find consistency with its returners and has been plagued by fumbles.</p>\n<p>Dion Lewis remains a threat in the Patriots’ return game in which he showcased his ability with a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the Patriots Divisional Round win over the Houston Texans.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Eric Weems holds things down for the Falcons and provides them with an ideal arrangement. Currently, in his 10th year, the veteran return specialist is sixth in the league in punt return average amongst qualified players and was the team’s leading returner during the regular season with 391 yards on 17 returns.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Falcons seem to have the special teams advantage, thanks to Stephen Gostkowski’s inconsistency and Eric Weems’s consistency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A

I mean, it wouldn’t be the Patriots as we know them without the most unexpected rookies, forgotten vets and other brushed-off players emerging year after year.</p>\n<p>While there’s no pinpointing Belichick’s “system,” his leadership and oftentimes disliked quirkiness has set him apart from the rest of the league.</p>\n<p>New England has become the league’s juggernaut that can never be counted out. The dynasty’s foundation has always been a storyline with tones of a franchise rebuilt from the ground up.</p>\n<p>This Sunday, their Super Bowl 51 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons is no different; the Patriots make their league-record ninth Super Bowl appearance in hopes of winning their fifth Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p>Both Belichick and Brady are currently in their 17th season with the Patriots organization. The opportunity to further cement themselves as the greatest to ever grace the sideline and field in NFL history is in full effect this Sunday.</p>\n<p>Belichick and Brady are the only coach and player ever to each achieve seven Super Bowl appearances. Thus far, they have been members of all four of the franchise’s Super Bowl-winning teams.</p>\n<p>The all-time leader in postseason wins by a quarterback with 24, Brady has the opportunity to become the first quarterback in NFL history to win five Super Bowls.</p>\n<p>While many are anticipating “Tom’s Revenge” after he endured a four-game suspension and witnessing Commissioner Roger Goodell hand Brady the Lombardi Trophy as an apology for the temporary ban, there seem to be more personal things at stake.</p>\n<p>For a quarterback who believes he could play until the age of 45, Brady has bigger concerns than Commissioner Goodell.</p>\n<p>Despite once again being in the MVP conversation after posting regular season numbers of 3,554 passing yards, 28 passing touchdowns, an 112.2 passer rating and just two interceptions, I think it’s safe to say Brady is ready to provide the final verdict of himself as the greatest QB ever.</p>\n<p>I’m sure you’re thinking, “Well, hasn’t he already established that?” However, it’s as if we’ve become so accustomed to Brady’s greatness that admiration for his consistency has gradually diminished.</p>\n<p>Yes, he is still elite. His legacy is further enhanced as a four-time Super Bowl champion and current two-time NFL MVP. Even still, these accomplishments have not been enough for those who doubt Brady’s placement amongst the best.</p>\n<p>From “Spygate” to “Deflategate” or even the argument that he has only attained his greatness because of Belichick’s coaching system, Brady still has something to prove.</p>\n<p>Whether or not a win on Sunday will curtail any of the criticisms Brady receives is unpredictable, but it’s certain that it will take more than Brady if a shootout takes place against the leader of the NFL’s top scoring offense in the Falcons’ quarterback Matt Ryan.</p>\n<p>Although the team’s player-coach duo has received the majority of the praise for its success year after year, the most integral role heading into Super Bowl LI is the Patriots’ receiving core.</p>\n<p>Brady’s ability to produce despite the lack of a true No. 1 receiver over the years is constantly glorified. Aside from Randy Moss’s stint with the Patriots from 2007-2009 and a return in 2010, New England has had few noteworthy receivers but has still managed to be one of the league’s top offenses each season.</p>\n<p>Via <em>sportingcharts.com</em>, since 2009 the New England Patriots have ranked in the top 10 of Team Yards After Catch (YAC) totals in six of the last eight seasons, including back-to-back No. 1 finishes in 2011 and 2012.</p>\n<p>This season, the Patriots ended the regular season third with a YAC total of 2,334, just 48 yards shorter than Atlanta’s second-place finish.</p>\n<p>Despite having just one 1,000 yard receiver in Julian Edelman, whose current total of 84 career postseason receptions is nine away from No. 2 all-time per <em>espn.com</em>, the Patriots’ receiving core was still a nightmare matchup for a majority of teams this season.</p>\n<p>While the season-ending injury to tight end Rob Gronkowski was detrimental to its offense, New England’s bevy of receiving options in Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell, Danny Amendola, Martellus Bennett and even running back James White has exposed defenses.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Falcons, there’s no one Patriot receiver to key in on, as each is versatile enough to line up in the slot or wide out near the sideline. Hogan, for example, is coming off a career performance after a record-setting 180 receiving yards on nine catches for two touchdowns in the team’s blowout AFC title win over Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>As long as the Pats can protect Brady and give him the ample amount of time in the pocket, it could be a field day for New England’s receivers. They will be facing an Atlanta defense that didn’t fare well against the pass during the regular season, allowing the fifth-most passing yards per game and passing touchdowns at a 266.7 average and a total of 31, which was five less than the league-high allowance of 36.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, I initially didn’t approach this piece with the belief that the Patriots would win this Sunday. Although my heart still resides with the underdog Atlanta, I am left somewhat undecided because of the unpredictability the tandem of Brady and Belichick presents.</p>\n<p>Whether it be Atlanta winning its first Super Bowl in franchise history or New England and Brady earning its fifth, history will be made to the benefit of not just football, but the culture of sports.</p>\n<p><strong>Atlanta Falcons by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Rooting for the underdog is definitely not new to a whole lot of people, especially in sports. This year is no different, as countless fans and non-fans alike will be rooting for the underdog Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>Newcomers to the biggest stage the game has to offer — considering their last, and only, Super Bowl appearance was in 1999 —the Falcons will certainly need to accommodate to the spotlight quickly if they have any shot of beating the league’s greatest dynasty, the New England Patriots.</p>\n<p>Looking back to the beginning of the season, no one could have possibly predicted that this team from the NFC South would be representing its respective side of the conference come February. ESPN’s Vaughn McClure had them missing the playoffs with a 7-9 overall record, while Heath Evans and Elliott Harrison of the NFL Network projected the Falcons to finish the regular season with only five wins.</p>\n<p>Having already proven the experts wrong just by making it to the Super Bowl, the Falcons want to take the ultimate step and win the whole thing.</p>\n<p>To go one step even further, who could have predicted that 10 years after the scandal of the once promising Michael Vick hurt the city of Atlanta — not to mention the cowardly departure of former Head Coach Bobby Petrino — that the Falcons would be one win away from hoisting the Lombardi trophy.</p>\n<p>Despite great moves by team owner Arthur Blank in the hiring of coaches and GMs throughout the last few years, no decision was a better one than the drafting of Matt Ryan. In a lot of ways, Ryan and Atlanta are very deserving of each other, especially in a game of this magnitude, as they both know the feeling of being the underdog.</p>\n<p>Drafted to replace Vick two years after Vick’s scandal, Ryan was expected to have great success right away for Atlanta. Although he enjoyed much success early in his career, his allure never reached the stature of the once promising Vick. The city never embraced him quite as tight as they did No. 7.</p>\n<p>The fact is many experts pegged Ryan as someone who would go down as a solid NFL quarterback, but not one that will win multiple, if even one championship. As the years progressed and his play seemed to flat line, this prediction seemed as though it would become true.</p>\n<p>The nine-year quarterback responded with easily the best season of his career, as he passed for career highs in both passing yards (4,944) and touchdowns (38) while throwing a career-low seven interceptions. Using all the weapons he has at his disposal, Ryan did not waste a single snap this year.</p>\n<p>Now, Atlanta and Ryan go hand-in-hand and the two seem to feed off each other in many ways. For the Falcons, Ryan might be the first truly great quarterback to bring them a championship, while Ryan has found a home in Atlanta and seems to love playing there as much as anyone else ever has.</p>\n<p>10 years ago, no one could have expected the Falcons to make such a quick recovery. After being blown out at home by the Packers in the 2011 Divisional Round, no one could have expected Matt Ryan to be the quarterback to lead the Falcons to the promise land. These two underdogs really do deserve each other come Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Falcons organization is truly becoming one of the greats in the NFL, and it started with the drafting of a 23-year-old quarterback from Boston College.</p>\n<p>Despite the MVP play from Ryan, Atlanta has made plenty of other tremendous decisions that have allowed them to enjoy the luxury of playing on the final Sunday of the NFL season. The drafting of star players like Julio Jones, Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, among others brought a new light back to Atlanta, and that has it set up for greatness.</p>\n<p>For those wondering if the Falcons Super Bowl run was just a fluke, you should consider the fact that Atlanta went 11-5 this season against the NFL’s toughest schedule in the league based on prior year’s record and won its division, easily going 5-1 with its only loss coming in week one to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>\n<p>Once more, the Falcons held down one of the best offenses in the entire league, ranking second in total yards and passing yards per game. They possessed the fifth best rushing attack at 120.5 rushing yards per game and owned the league’s highest scoring offense, averaging 33.8 points per game; no other team even averaged more than 30 points per game this year.</p>\n<p>Winners of their last six ball games, including playoffs, the Falcons are certainly coming in as a team that caught fire at the right time. Over its last six victories, Atlanta has averaged a total of 39 points per game, a league high over that span, while only surrendering 19.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>The playoffs have been a breeze for the Dirty Birds as well, as they rolled over both the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers at home, defeating them by an average of 19.5 points in each of those games.</p>\n<p>I mean, just looking at the numbers; Ryan and the Falcons seem poised to be the next champions of the football world, proving themselves much more than underdogs.</p>\n<p>When the playoffs first started, it was safe to assume the Falcons didn’t have many experts picking them to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl. Now that they are here, experts are flocking toward the experienced Patriots to defeat them despite having been proved wrong all season. What’s one more game, Falcons?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 2nd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Just recently it was announced that the Falcons broke their franchise-record with 540 total points scored in 2016. This makes complete sense when you have a top-3 wide receiver in Julio Jones lining up on the outside, an outstanding 1-2 punch of a running back committee with Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, and last but definitely not least the very talented Matt Ryan. Atlanta may have very well found themselves a gunslinger 2.0 in Ryan, better yet he might actually find himself as the league MVP when it’s all said and done. Now, with great offense comes great def- … actually, the Falcons are 27<sup>th</sup> overall in points allowed per game. Luckily, Seattle only averages 15 points per game on the road. Falcons’ fans can also rest even easier considering the Seahawks offensive line will be no match against defensive tackle Grady Jarrett. This youth sensation is sure to see his fair share of tackles, maybe even a sack or two.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive quickly into Seattle’s Wild Card round against Detroit last week. The Detroit defense didn’t show up to play at all, Matthew Stafford had arguably his worst game of the year, keep in mind he was throwing with a finger injury, and the Lions just weren’t as playoff-ready as everyone had figured them to be. Regardless, a great primetime showing from Seattle, however, change needs to be made before facing Atlanta this Saturday. Partially, points need to be put on the board. Therefore, Russell Wilson has to maintain his momentum and the receiving corps has to start catching everything thrown their way; although, for the most part, this game will only be won if they can stop the very productive Falcons offense. Enter Richard Sherman and Michael Bennett. The game plan here is simple gentlemen, Richard stop Julio and Michael sack Ryan. It’s time again for Sherman to prove his moniker of “I’m the best corner in the game” and for Bennett to be as disruptive to an opposing offense as ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Players to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>ATL: (QB) Matt Ryan / (DT) Grady Jarrett</p>\n<p>SEA: (CB) Richard Sherman / (DE) Michael Bennett</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>Atlanta Falcons</p>\n<p><strong>New England Patriots vs. Houston Texans</strong></p>\n<p>Saturday, Jan. 14, 2017</p>\n<p>8:15 PM E.T.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74833\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74833\" data-attachment-id=\"74833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/nfl-playoffs-divisional-round-matchups/pats-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?fit=913%2C795&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"913,795\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"pats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?fit=250%2C218&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?fit=888%2C773&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74833\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?resize=340%2C296\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Matt Stone / Boston Herald\" width=\"340\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?w=913&amp;ssl=1 913w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?resize=250%2C218&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?resize=768%2C669&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Matt Stone / Boston Herald</p></div>\n<p>Is Houston’s impressive pass-rush enough to upset Tom Brady and Bill Belichick’s postseason plans?</p>\n<p>It’s a familiar sight in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Ever since the start of the Tom Brady era, Gillette Stadium and its fans have gotten used to being active this late in January for postseason football. Only difference here is a big thing is missing. The league’s best tight-end, Rob Gronkowski, will not be active ever since his slew of injuries halfway through the season. What does this mean for the Patriots? The receivers will have to carry the slack, which they have been doing for the most part with Martellus Bennett filling in as big man and rookie Malcolm Mitchell surprising us all. However, it’ll be Julian Edelman in at the slot that will set the tempo for the game. Edelman is Tom Brady’s favorite, statistically speaking, target. As for run plays, the new protocol is hand it to LeGarrette Blount. He tried to make a statement last year, but has definitely gotten the idea through this season: Blount is the lead back for New England…and a scary good one for that matter.</p>\n<p>The “Upset Every Raiders Fan in the Nation” award goes to Houston, runner-up: Derek Carr’s season-ending injury. It was a close one considering the circumstances between the Texans and Raiders game, a little too close. Brock Osweiler actually showed his worth last week, even if that worth still comes nowhere near his $70 million cost. In the end, all the applause went to the Texans defense, and rightfully so. Thanks to standout performances by the two outside linebackers, Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus, the Raiders quarterback Connor Cook was hardly able to look down the field for more than a second without +200 lbs. of pressure rushing his way. Therefore, if the Texans wish to scrape a postseason victory on the road, they’ll have to manage Clowney and Mercilus’ playtime whilst making sure the play calls frequently involve blitz arrows pointing towards Brady.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Players to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>NE: (RB) LeGarrette Blount / (WR) Julian Edelman</p>\n<p>HOU: (LB) Jadeveon Clowney / (LB) Whitney Mercilus</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>New England Patriots</p>\n<p><strong>Dallas Cowboys vs. Green Bay Packers</strong></p>\n<p>Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017</p>\n<p>4:40 PM E.T.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74834\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74834\" data-attachment-id=\"74834\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/nfl-playoffs-divisional-round-matchups/dak-and-pack/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dak-and-pack\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74834\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?resize=356%2C237\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Hannah Foslien/Getty Images\" width=\"356\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?w=630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74834\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Hannah Foslien/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>Offense aficionados eat your heart out; it’s going to be a long day of great football.</p>\n<p>Prescott and Elliott, two of the most talked about rookies in the NFL right now. When it mattered most as Dallas lost Romo to yet another injury, Prescott stepped forward and gave Cowboys fans hope. Now, all his work as the QB for “America’s team” has finally paid off…playoff time. Who better to compliment his play than rookie talent Elliott? It doesn’t stop there folks, who will protect Prescott from opposing rushers and open gaps for Elliot to rush through? The larger than life Cowboys offensive line, that’s who; I had to include them here considering they don’t get nowhere near enough media attention as they should for the work they do. At the end of the day though, the spotlight will remain focused on the rookies and whether or not they can lead their team to glory.</p>\n<p>Here’s some big news, really good if you’re a Cowboys fan and really bad if you’re a Packers fan, Jordy Nelson is ruled out for this divisional matchup. What on Earth will the Packers ever do now? Well, when your quarterback is Aaron Rodgers, you tend to find a way to win regardless of the situation. Randall Cobb, you’re up next. Last week, on only five receptions, Cobb caught 116 yards for three touchdowns. It doesn’t take an expert to realize that Cobb should remain isolated as much as possible in the slot receiver position. As for the big question, who will fill in on the outside for Jordy Nelson? Davante Adams, congrats, you’re the winner. Also against the Giants, Adams caught 125 yards for a touchdown on eight receptions. Wow, looks like either the receivers are really great or Rodgers is too good of a quarterback that losing his number one target doesn’t faze him. Well, the truth is that both are correct, and that will be proven as Green Bay is sure to put up a close game against Dallas.</p>\n<p><strong>Players to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>GB: (WR) Randall Cobb / (WR) Davante Adams</p>\n<p>DAL: (QB) Dak Prescott / (RB) Ezekiel Elliott</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>Green Bay Packers</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs</strong></p>\n<p>Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017</p>\n<p>8:20 PM E.T.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74835\" style=\"width: 418px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74835\" data-attachment-id=\"74835\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/nfl-playoffs-divisional-round-matchups/chiefs-and-steelers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?fit=1040%2C781&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1040,781\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"chiefs-and-steelers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?fit=888%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74835\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers-1024x769.jpg?resize=408%2C307\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of                                                                Peter Diana/Post-Gazette\" width=\"408\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Peter Diana/Post-Gazette</p></div>\n<p>Steelers’ best offensive trio in the league versus the Chiefs’ best defense in the league, surely this will be game of the week.</p>\n<p>It’s plain and simple; the Steelers swept the Dolphins last week. With the final score at 30-12, star players like Le’Veon Bell had 167 all-purpose yards for two touchdowns. Not to mention Antonio Brown’s 124 yards for two more touchdowns on five receptions, truly phenomenal play and very entertaining for the fans. The player to highlight here, however, is the man behind the passes, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Aged 34, Roethlisberger is still making plays he’d normally make five years ago. Which is why the Steelers postseason success will revolve around Big Ben’s consistency from here on out. Now, onto some media drama, Head Coach Mike Tomlin has been in the news recently for being picked apart on his true team role. “He’s a ‘cheerleader guy’”, “he runs an organization built on emotion, not on actual structure”, these are but a few things critics have stated against Tomlin’s tactics. The rational thing here is to not lash back at media outlets, rather do what every other NFL coach does before a game on Sunday; plan for a win. It’ll be a hard one, but Tomlin will be sure to come out to Arrowhead Stadium with something to prove.</p>\n<p>Marcus Peters, Eric Berry, Justin Houston, Dontari Poe. These are just a few of many highly esteemed players on the Chiefs defense, but surely postseason games can’t be won on defense alone. This is where Tyreek Hill comes in. Hill is arguably the fastest player in the entire NFL and will have opposing defensive coordinators scratching their head at how to shut him down. He can catch touchdowns, he can run them in, and heck, he can even return kicks. All around, Hill is the most exciting player for Kansas City right now, and he will once again have his day, this time in the postseason. Don’t count on him having all the fun however, running back Spencer Ware has been quite the replacement ever since Pro Bowler Jamaal Charles was injured early on in the season. Averaging 4.3 yards per hand-off, don’t be surprised when Ware is running straight through the center on 3<sup>rd</sup> down.</p>\n<p><strong>Players (Personnel) to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>PIT: (QB) Ben Roethlisberger / (Head Coach) Mike Tomlin</p>\n<p>KC: (WR) Tyreek Hill / (RB) Spencer Ware</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>Kansas City Chiefs</p>\n<p><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>It’s the postseason, so every game from here on out is sure to be exciting. This late in the season, it’s all up to the star athletes to come through for their teams and really show how much they want that championship ring.

During the 1968 Summer Olympics, U.S. runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith famously did the Black Power salute in the medal ceremony, raising their black-gloved fists in the air while the national anthem played.</p>\n<p>The athletes were subsequently banned from the games, and upon returning home they found themselves, and their families, receiving death threats.</p>\n<p>The two Olympic runners never wavered from their protest, and just this year the pair supported another protest from a fellow athlete, Colin Kaepernick.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco 49ers quarterback has been kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in football games since the start of the 2016 season in protest of recent wrongdoings done to the black community in America.</p>\n<p>Fellow football players have joined Kaepernick in his protest during the national anthem, and the reason for his protest has inspired other demonstrations in other professional leagues.</p>\n<p>On July 9 and 10, several teams in the WNBA wore black shirts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. They bore the names of victims Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The teams also wore shirts in memory of the five victims of the Dallas shooting.</p>\n<p>The WNBA fined the three teams (the New York Liberty, the Indiana Fever and the Phoenix Mercury) $5,000 each, and each player was fined $500 for violating the league’s uniform policy.</p>\n<p>The WNBA later rescinded the fines and vouched support for the players’ protest, but the initial punishment is exactly the type of action that prevents and intimidates players from attempting to use their platform to make their political statements.</p>\n<p>No matter what the political views or stances are that athletes desire to use their platforms to advocate for, the leagues must commit to providing an environment for athletes to utilize their First Amendment rights and demonstrate if they choose to do so without fear of reprisal.</p>\n<p>Players like the ones in the WNBA, Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are no different from the likes of celebrated athletic and cultural icons like Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos.</p>\n<p>These players from the past and present have used their platform and influence to evoke change, not because of a need to boost their own profile, but to serve the basic human desire to speak out against something that is unjust and unfair.</p>\n<p>These players deserve to be seen as people, not just athletes, who patriotically utilize their First Amendment rights to take a stand despite criticism from the public or even their own league.</p>\n<p>All athletes from across the country, whether at the professional, collegiate or high school level, deserve an environment conducive to exercise their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>“In any protest, I think you make a statement to try and reach the far ends of the Earth.

Such is the case for the UC Santa Barbara men’s water polo program who, after 24 years in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), made the decision to transition over to a new conference: the Golden Coast Conference (GCC).</p>\n<p>UCSB’s decision to move was influenced by many different factors, but one of the biggest was the lack of winning in the conference that was made up of the four perennial powerhouses of NCAA water polo: UCLA, USC, Cal and Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Throughout that same time span, the four big teams won every single conference tournament, with USC winning the most at nine MPSF titles and UCLA, Cal and Stanford each winning five apiece.</p>\n<p>Most notably, an MPSF water polo team has won the national title since the inception of the conference in 1992.</p>\n<p>In the 24 years the Gauchos spent in the MPSF, they never once enjoyed the luxury of taking home a conference tournament or an NCAA title.</p>\n<p>Only one team was not a part of the big four, as Pepperdine won the NCAA championship back during the 1997-98 campaign. In the other 23 years, USC again has had the most titles with nine after winning six straight titles from 2008-2013. UCLA has the second most with seven, Stanford has five and Cal wraps it up with three.</p>\n<p>With those four squads constantly dominating a water polo conference that held as many as 10 teams a year, it was hard for the Gauchos to embrace being in the middle of the pack time and time again.</p>\n<p>“We always try hard no matter what league we were in,” junior attacker Shane Hauschild said. “But it was a bit deflating not being able to go to the NCAAs just because you couldn’t beat the top two teams [in the country].”</p>\n<p>The frequent finish in the middle of the conference undoubtedly had a discouraging effect after gradually achieving upsets over some of the nation’s top teams each season. To feel like the peak of the season could be to earn a No. 4 seed in the conference tournament, then losing to the No. 1 ranked team in the country after just upsetting the No. 2 seed was demoralizing.</p>\n<p>During many years in the MPSF, teams like Santa Barbara had great seasons that ended all too soon because of one loss. UCSB has had the talent in years to defeat teams like UCLA, which it did back in 2012 during the Southern California Tournament. Before winning against the Bruins, the Gauchos also defeated the Cardinal before ultimately falling to USC in the championship.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, that result alone highlights the issue at hand. At that time, UCSB was ranked No. 6 and defeated No. 3 Stanford, then No. 2 UCLA and was expected to beat No. 1 USC all within 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The reality of the matchups were nearly implausible considering that those three aforementioned teams garnered players from other countries that already had Olympic experience on their rosters.</p>\n<p>In comparison to other sports, specifically the current college football season, No. 1 Alabama opened the season against No. 20 USC, which it routed. But the week after they weren’t expected to compete against another top-20 team, let alone a top-five opponent.</p>\n<p>It is deflating to think that the only way UCSB and other schools like Pacific, LBSU, UCI and other middle-of-the-pack teams of the MPSF could make the NCAA tournament is by having to knock off the top three teams in the country first. This is something that isn’t expected in most other collegiate sports, unless it’s in the actual NCAA Tournament, and even then it’s not always the case.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74229\" style=\"width: 426px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74229\" data-attachment-id=\"74229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-refreshing-change-of-scenery-ucsbs-conference-turnaround/tommy-fellner-passes-the-ball-to-a-teammate-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-22-16_8-web-1.jpg?fit=2400%2C1590&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1590\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tommy Fellner passes the ball to a teammate.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>That is why, after 24 years, Santa Barbara men’s water polo and Head Coach Wolf Wigo decided to make the jump and move on to a new conference, one more suitable and one that could give teams such as itself what they desired: a chance to make a run at the NCAA championship.</p>\n<p>The GCC had already established women’s water polo, which UCSB also is a member of dating back to 2013. When the circumstance emerged that many teams were looking for a new home for men’s water polo, the GCC jumped in.</p>\n<p>Moving on, just like UCSB, are Pacific, Long Beach State, UC Irvine, Pepperdine and San Jose State. Each program’s departure left only the big four schools in the MPSF, leading to the conference being in a temporarily troubled state.</p>\n<p>“We lost six of our 10 teams after they were forming a new league in an effort to find an easier path to the NCAA Tournament,” MPSF Commissioner Al Beaird said. “That did put us in a difficult bind since the NCAA requires six teams to have an automatic bid into the championship.”</p>\n<p>In order to help soften the blow, the MPSF announced on June 30 that it was able to find one more team to join the elite four and granted membership to Penn State University Behrend. Getting the fifth team, the MPSF was granted a grace period to retain an automatic qualifier for this year; however, they still will most likely lose that bid come next season.</p>\n<p>“Even if we can get six teams next year, we probably will not be able to qualify for an automatic [bid] because those six teams have to play together for a total of two years,” Beaird said. “We will have to earn our way into the tournament with at-large berths which isn’t the ideal situation, but the quality of the MPSF teams is still strong.”</p>\n<p>On the other side, despite not being able to get an automatic qualifier for the first year, UCSB was happy to be in a conference that feels more evenly matched than stacked against them.</p>\n<p>Earning immediate results, UCSB went out and proved itself in its first year.</p>\n<p>In the inaugural GCC season, the Gauchos ran away with the regular season conference title going a perfect 5-0 after defeating Pacific, LBSU, UCI, Pepperdine and San Jose State.</p>\n<p>The perfect GCC finish was UCSB’s first undefeated conference season since 1979, which coincidentally was the last time Santa Barbara won their first and only Division I NCAA title. Now, the Gauchos hold the No. 1 seed heading into the conference tournament, something they never experienced when they were in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>The newfound confidence in this Gaucho team is evident. They closed out the season winning their final seven games and 10 of the last 11. Influencing the successful finish was not having to face the challenge of playing the top-four nationally ranked talent every single game.</p>\n<p>“Having a legitimate shot of winning the conference, even if you’re a low seed, and getting a shot at the NCAA is huge,” Wigo said. “Any team in the GCC can beat a Pac-12 team, but they can’t typically win three games in a row against them, and starting next year, you win one game and suddenly you’re in the National Championship where anything can happen.”</p>\n<p>And even when they did face top talent this season, UCSB did well. Despite not beating UCLA or Cal, the Gauchos played each game pretty close. Not only that, it did knock off Stanford earlier this year to reach the No. 4 spot in the national rankings, its highest spot since 1990.</p>\n<p>Even though it’s still early and hasn’t been a full calendar year yet, it’s pretty safe to say that the Gauchos made the right decision in making the move out of the MPSF. It was not done out of spite or hate but instead out of what was truly better for UCSB’s program going forward.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t in their best interest for us to leave, but it was in all our best interests, and I think it’s in the best interest of the sport,” Wigo said. “They were a little upset at first, but anyone not in the MPSF would recognize it was a good move.”</p>\n<p>Even though most coaches declined to be interviewed for this piece — most of them due to the fact they were getting ready for the MPSF Tournament this week — it is clear there is still a respect among all the coaches, especially due to the fact they still all scheduled to play each other.</p>\n<p>“We do some joint scheduling and ensured that coaches from both conferences and commissioners like myself maintain those relationships, because having that competition is important to both conferences.” Beaird said.</p>\n<p>Overall, although the move did hurt the MPSF a bit, it is clear that this was the right thing for the Gauchos to do. The confidence that has peaked in this team — as it knows that it can win its conference year in and year out — is apparent especially in seniors who have experienced UCSB’s past before its present state.</p>\n<p>“It’s great that we now have that confidence of going undefeated during season,” senior attacker Mitchell Hamilton said. “And it really helps drive us to win those last two games [conference tournament] and win our division.”</p>\n<p>It is underwhelming to stay in the same middle of the pack each year, never feeling like you are living up to the true potential that lives inside you as it does in every person, every family and every team.</p>\n<p>Like UCSB proved, moving forward and pivoting from that same old structure could make the difference by you not only living up to your potential, but also finding that confidence to be as happy as you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

night in which LeBron James sat out the second game of a back-to-back trip, the Cleveland Cavaliers remain the best team in the NBA thus far.</p>\n<p>The mission to “Defend the Land” has been placed in full drive with the Cavs, who once again look like the clear favorite to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals come June.</p>\n<p>The journey to repeat as NBA champions is no guarantee, but through 11 games — 10 of which have been against Eastern Conference opponents — the Cavs are 9-2. Most notably, they have defeated two of the East’s projected top contenders: the Toronto Raptors (twice this season) and the Boston Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its first defeat, the Cavs’ 6-0 start stands as the best team start in LeBron James’s career, having reached the 5-1 mark a total of three times in two consecutive seasons with Miami in 2012 and 2013 in addition to last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>\n<p>The end result of each season that started 5-1? Three NBA championship titles.</p>\n<p>It was the second-best start in franchise history, falling short of the 1976-77 Cavaliers’ 8-0 start.</p>\n<p>Although records don’t tell all about a team, Cleveland’s current squad could be the best team that has ever surrounded James, who is currently in his 10th season with the franchise since returning in 2014.</p>\n<p>Despite still being in his prime, at 31 years old James faces the reality of father time creeping up, considering the retirements of basketball legends Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett this past season and offseason.</p>\n<p>Although the King’s dethronement isn’t expected anytime soon, having recently surpassed NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon for 10th place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, the Cavaliers’ hometown superstar has about four to six years remaining in his career.</p>\n<p>It is a time span that reinforces the same message since his return to Cleveland: Win now.</p>\n<p>No one can predict what the Cavaliers will become post-LeBron, especially after the additions made in recent years, but it is likely the team will lose its value as a top contender. The immediate decline in wins from 2010-2014, occurring during James’s stint with the Heat, was more than enough evidence that it must build around their star player.</p>\n<p>The first step toward rebuilding during those four seasons was the selection of Kyrie Irving with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA with a foot injury and offset by other nagging injuries throughout his career, the most significant being his fractured kneecap in game one of the 2015 NBA Finals, Irving slightly became a forgotten cause as a player with the potential to be one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>Despite Irving earning the 2011-12 Rookie of the Year award and being known for his ability to score, a lack of acknowledgment for his game still remained.</p>\n<p>After LeBron James signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension during the 2014 offseason, his unexpected return that same year has worked in the favor of Irving ever since.</p>\n<p>Playing in just 53 games last season after recovering from the previous year’s knee injury, Irving has excelled, proving his ability to take over on the game’s biggest stage in the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Convincing many that he outplayed the two-time NBA MVP Steph Curry in the series, averaging 27.1 points per game and scoring the game-winning three-point dagger in his face to secure Cleveland’s first-ever title, Irving used the postseason to remind and prove to the world he is one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>It was obvious then, and it is obvious now that without Irving the Cavaliers cannot win an NBA championship.</p>\n<p>Whenever it seems like the Cavs are down and out on the brink of defeat, it is Irving who has stepped up as the team’s savior when even James wouldn’t be expected to prevail.</p>\n<p>Although other players such as J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Kevin Love and more play pivotal roles in the Cavs’ success as well, the tandem of Irving and James has formulated a one-two punch that is capable of carrying Cleveland to future title victories.</p>\n<p>The pairing of the two has helped reduce the pressures on James and provides Cleveland with an option to stay within winning games as the team’s leader rests.<br>\nFor purposes of rest, James intentionally sat out for the first time this season in the Cavs’ game against the Pacers.</p>\n<p>In addition to scoring the ball well, ranking third in the league in scoring at 109 PPG, Cleveland has remained consistent on defense, allowing 103.5 PPG. Despite the average, the Cavs have allowed 100-plus points in just six of their 11 games this season.</p>\n<p>Although the Golden State Warriors, considered Cleveland’s rival as we anticipate a third-consecutive Finals meeting between the two, are a team capable of going back and forth in a shootout with any team, their occasional lapses on defense detract from their league-leading 117.3 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Warriors are tied for allowing the seventh highest opponent PPG average at 109.3. In comparison to Cleveland’s six games, Golden State has allowed 100-plus points in nine of its 11 games.</p>\n<p>It is true the Warriors are still adjusting to their addition of former NBA MVP Kevin Durant and the departures of primary role players Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut, but Golden State must find a way to resolve its inconsistencies, which mainly fall on it becoming smaller around the key and paint areas.</p>\n<p>One can only hope another Cavs-Warriors championship matchup will take place. After leading in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks in the NBA Finals, if James and co. were able to defeat the self-embraced “Super Villains” of Golden State, he would achieve the ultimate victory that would earn him a nod in surpassing two of the game’s greatest in Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Much is still to occur throughout this season. There will be phases during which Cleveland will look like the best team or falter to its high expectations, preventing the prediction of the Cavs winning it all in 2016-17.</p>\n<p>It’s a game-by-game process in which teams continue to develop, even in the case of the Cleveland Cavaliers heading into year three of James being back at the helm. Their “All In” mentality is a motto that persists in the championship-or-bust expectations that have become standard for fans such as ourselves to judge accordingly.</p>\n<p>All stats are accurate as of Nov. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/","id":3338,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3337,3336,3335],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cubs Win World Series, End 108 Years of Torment","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After 108 years, the curse is over and the Cubs are winners again.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_73821\" style=\"width: 591px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73821\" data-attachment-id=\"73821\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/ap_16308175159360/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=1500%2C1111&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1111\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ap_16308175159360\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=888%2C657&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73821\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360-1024x758.jpg?resize=581%2C430\" alt=\"David J.

The Cubs, having not won since 1908, and the Indians since 1948, gave both teams the intense motivation to push them to game seven. Each game, inning, and play has kept baseball fans across the nation glued to their televisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading by three at the top of the eighth inning, the Cubs had reason to feel confident, but leave it to the Indians to come back from behind when pressure is on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the first World Series to be tied in the ninth inning since 1991 between the Twins and the Braves, according to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These two knock-out teams managed to keep it tied and send the game into extra innings, stirring up every Cubs and Tribe fan alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here it was, the 10th inning that will go down in Cubs baseball history. Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw  intentionally walks Anthony Rizzo, a hitting all-star this post-season, as well as Addison Russell,  to prevent any chance of hits from these two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist slammed double into left field, sending Albert Amora Jr. home to push the Cubs ahead. Miguel Montero, then singles, knocked Rizzo home for another run. The Cubs headed into the bottom of the 10th with just three outs standing between them and their first World Series title in over a century. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd has seen this scenario before in the eighth inning when the Indians were able to turn it around; the real question was would they be able to pull it off again in the 10th?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carl Edwards Jr., Cubs reliever, managed to snag two outs. But with one left, the Indians scored as right-handed hitter Rajai Davis smacked a line drive to center field. Mike Montgomery enters as the Cubs attempt to clench one last out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within two pitches, the Chicago Cubs had made history. It took every member of the team, both offensively and defensively, to achieve what this group has achieved, and the victory is oh so sweet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist, Cubs second baseman, and seasoned player, was named Series MVP after his hit in the 10th-inning of game seven that changed baseball history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zobrist was most recently a Kansas City Royal and helped in winning the 2015 World Series. His presence on the field as a defender has made quite the impression, causing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usatoday.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to call him a “super utility player,” as well as his stellar record as a switch-hitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cubs coaches and administrators alike have called Zobrist a professional and role model both on and off the field — both from his “work ethic” to “clubhouse professionalism.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A close runner-up would have been Rizzo as he played an enormous role in leading his team to victory, but the second baseman’s title was well earned. Ben Zobrist is a name no Cubs fan will ever forget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This National League powerhouse team was chosen early in the 2016 season as a team to watch and has now surpassed all expectations and crushed all doubts.

Shoulders commercials, gracing the Madden 2016 cover, having a friendship with Drake and, of course, the unforgettable one-handed catch, Beckham is constantly surrounded by the glitz and glamour of superstardom, especially while in one of the nation’s biggest markets: New York.</p>\n<p>Currently in his third season, Beckham is well-deserving of the praise he receives for his performance on the field. His 2,744 receiving yards through his first two seasons is the most in NFL history, eclipsing the previous record of 2,726 yards set by Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Although his immediate impact will be considered, the question of whether Beckham belongs within the diva class still persists.</p>\n<p>Quite frankly, the answer is no. Beckham is not a diva.</p>\n<p>It’s as if people have forgotten the exuberance and appreciation we had when tuning in not to watch the New York Giants play but rather to see the performance of Odell Beckham Jr.</p>\n<p>From the pregame catching drills full of one-handed snags to graceful jumps in the air displaying his vertical explosiveness, Beckham has served as the main attraction since his introduction to the Big City of Dreams.</p>\n<p>Sure, each player has their own way of expressing their anger when frustrated or dealing with overcoming the challenge of biting on the bait of an opponent, but is it plausible to define a player by such a behavior?</p>\n<p>In the case of Beckham, excluding his fiery and sensitive character when on the field, he hasn’t been a true detriment to the Giants’ success.</p>\n<p>While he deserves to be held accountable for the penalties he has amassed this season, a total of three (one apiece for taunting, unsportsmanlike conduct and offensive pass interference), Beckham has yet to be the reason as to why the Giants have lost games.</p>\n<p>With Super Bowl XLVI being the New York Giants’ last postseason appearance, it’s safe to say that OBJ is not an inhibiting element in the team’s playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>But football is a team sport in which brotherhood is vital to the locker-room culture, right? No individual player should be excused of the team’s successes and failures, correct?</p>\n<p>Despite the truths of both of these questions, the team loyalty of players such as quarterback Eli Manning and first-year Head Coach Ben McAdoo has to be acknowledged as they both proclaimed Beckham’s sideline acts to be a distraction to the team.</p>\n<p>Yes, Beckham was a distraction. But shouldn’t these issues be attended to and resolved internally? The calling out of Beckham just added more fuel to the fire in painting the progression of the wideout receiving the diva label.</p>\n<p>By making claims of football not being fun anymore to celebrating on the sidelines, mocking his incident with the kicking net in the form of a proposal, Beckham has become one of the league’s most unpredictable personalities.</p>\n<p>Of course it is always more appealing to be on the positive end of this spectrum, but sometimes the reserved or under under-the-radar demeanor of some players doesn’t exist for all.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider the Hall of Fame career of Terrell Owens.</p>\n<p>Second in all-time NFL career receiving yards with 15, 934 yards, third in receiving touchdowns at 153, sixth all-time in career receptions with 1,078 receptions, the record holder for receptions in a single-game with 20 to go along with a multitude of other accolades, Owens is one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history.</p>\n<p>While his renowned talent and statistical achievements surpass the qualifications of a Hall of Fame nomination, it was the diva stigma that prevented Owens from being a first ballot Hall of Famer.</p>\n<p>Yes, Owens was a diva, beyond the behavior of Beckham thus far. Yes, he did play on five different teams in his NFL career. But, most importantly, he produced when it mattered most and at some point reigned as the league’s best wide receiver. These are facts that should have outweighed personality in the evaluation of Owens.</p>\n<p>Two different players, two different personalities cut from a different cloth.</p>\n<p>The narrative of the diva wide receiver remains and is here to stay. However, the headlines and perceptions formed are only parts to a story that has yet to be fully disclosed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 27, 2016’s print

She began her collegiate career playing outside hitter in all 27 of UCSB’s matches, something that, as a first-year, gave her insight into the importance of hard work.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely a big transition coming from high school to college; every athlete knows that,” Hoffman said. “The biggest thing is that as soon as you come in, you have to have the same maturity as everyone else. Once you’re in college, age doesn’t matter. You have to just work for your spot.”</p>\n<p>Hoffman immediately proved herself a worthy contributor on the court, and by season’s end, she’d racked up almost 230 kills on an average of 2.34 per set, both of which ranked in the top four on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgement for her play would come soon, as she was awarded Big West Freshman of the Week honors, earned a place on the All-Big West Freshman Team and received an honorable mention for the All-Big West Team itself.</p>\n<p>“It was a great experience,” Hoffman reminisced. “I was able to play with all the seniors that left, and I learned a lot from them.”</p>\n<p>The team found decent success with a 13-14 overall record and an 8-8 mark in conference play. While slightly down from the wildly successful 2013 season in which the Gauchos went 13-3 and won a share of the Big West crown, the season was a useful development period for Hoffman and UCSB’s other younger players.</p>\n<p>After such a stellar start to her UCSB career, Hoffman’s continued improvement was seemingly inevitable in her sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>Through non-conference play last season, her game was clearly growing and becoming more efficient. While Hoffman’s offensive production dropped somewhat with only 1.95 kills per set in her sophomore campaign, her kill percentage rose from .138 in her first-year season to .221 in her second.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 25, the Gauchos were handed a 3-0 sweep by a Hawaii team that would go on to an undefeated conference schedule. Hoffman lead the team that night with seven kills and only one error on 18 attacks (.333 kill percentage) and added 11 digs.</p>\n<p>“It was such a sudden injury,” Hoffman recalled. “I actually played on it the rest of the match. It was in a tournament here, and then we travelled to Hawaii and I played on it there. I found out after we came back.”</p>\n<p>After learning that she’d torn her PCL, Hoffman would have to begin the long road to recovery.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73476\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2062297678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73498\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73476\" data-attachment-id=\"73476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/wvball_vsucd-161006-dustinharris-04-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"wvball_vsucd-161006-dustinharris-04-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73476\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=335%2C502\" alt=\"Chanel Hoffman serves with topspin to the deep corner.

Both marks rank ninth in the Big West, as she’s established herself as one of the best outside hitters in the conference. She’s been killing her attacks at a .237 mark, and is one of five UCSB players in the Big West’s top 25 for the statistic.</p>\n<p>The junior outside hitter is tied for 11th in the conference with 19 service aces on the season (.24 per set), and her offensive dominance in the 2016 season has notched her seventh in the Big West with 3.8 points per set.</p>\n<p>Hoffman’s 2.35 digs per set are an improvement of 1.52 from her mark in the previous season and of 0.42 over her first-year campaign. The defense from the outside makes Hoffman a consistent double-double threat, and her presence at the net to the tune of 0.54 blocks per set further contributes to her role as one of the league’s most all-around players.</p>\n<p>“The coaches really push us in the gym and in the weight room,” Hoffman said. “I’ve been helped by the athletic trainers especially to get back [physically].”</p>\n<p>Team chemistry has also helped Hoffman reach personal success.</p>\n<p>“We have a really good team dynamic,” Hoffman said. “All of the freshmen coming in have key roles on the team, and I’m really proud of them.”</p>\n<p>The team has focused heavily on creating that team dynamic this season. With all the young talent on the roster, creating team unity has proved its most valuable tool.</p>\n<p>“C3HD: commitment, confidence, communication, happiness, determination,” Hoffman said. “That’s really been our motto all season, and it’s really helped us.”</p>\n<p>With seven conference games left, the Gauchos are hoping to win out and claim a spot in the NCAA postseason. The young Gaucho squad has shown serious flashes, including taking the league leading Long Beach State 49ers to a fifth set this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“One of our goals is to win the Big West, and it’s still possible,” Hoffman declared. “We really want to get to the NCAA tournament, and I believe we can as long as we keep winning and keep this streak.”</p>\n<p>Whatever success the Gauchos are able to have toward the end of this season, it will be a direct cause of the consistent excellence and unity that Hoffman has helped foster. With the injury behind her, success is the only thing that lies ahead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 and continued on page 9 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/","id":1917,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1916,1915,1914],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
