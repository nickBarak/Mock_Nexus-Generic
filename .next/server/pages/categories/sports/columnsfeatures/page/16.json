Instead of a selecting big time playmakers, the Chiefs and Jaguars selected offensive tackles Eric Fisher and Luke Joeckel with the first two overall picks.</p>\n<p>This draft marks the first time since 2008 that an offensive tackle was taken first overall, and the first time since 1970 that offensive tackles were taken with the first two picks. The madness didn’t stop there either. Out of the 32 picks in the first round, 18 were spent on either an offensive or defensive lineman. To top it all off, this draft was the first time a running back wasn’t taken in the first round since 1963.</p>\n<p>All of that was semi-expected. What was not foreseen was the Bills selection of Florida St. quarterback E.J. Manuel with the 16th overall pick. Many experts had West Virginia’s Geno Smith as the top rated quarterback, but the Bills and first year Head Coach Doug Marrone decided to go with Manuel. Marrone is coming to the Bills via Syracuse, where Ryan Nassib was his quarterback. There was a lot of speculation that the Bills would select Nassib and keep him with his college coach. However, the Bills ultimately decided to trade down from their original spot at number eight overall to 16th overall and select Manuel.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Those were some of the top story lines from the first round; here is a look at some of the draft classes for individual teams.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Francisco 49ers:</p>\n<p>The 49ers did not have any glaring needs heading into the draft. During the offseason, defensive tackle Isaac Sopoaga signed with the Eagles and safety Dashon Goldson signed with the Buccaneers. However, before the draft, the Niners added depth at those positions by signing safety Craig Dahl and former fifth overall pick and defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey. These replacements aren’t on the same level but they are certainly capable players.</p>\n<p>With their first three picks in the draft, the Niners went with safety Matt Elam, defensive end Cornellius “Tank” Carradine, and tight end Vance McDonald. Elam is coming out of the University of Florida where he proved he can impact the game with his coverage and tackling skills. McDonald fills the void left by back up tight end Delanie Walker’s departure. In the fourth round, the Niners selected South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore. Lattimore was a perennial preseason Heisman candidate before tearing his ACL and dislocating his knee cap in consecutive seasons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Diego Chargers:</p>\n<p>The Chargers are in an awkward place as a team right now. Five or six years ago, the Chargers were one of the most talented teams in the league. Now it seems as though the rest of the league has gotten better, while the Chargers have let their roster wither. Now with a new general manager in Tom Telesco and first year Head Coach Mike McCoy at the reins, the Chargers are headed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Entering the draft, the Chargers had obvious needs on the offensive line and at the wide receiver position. With their first three picks, San Diego took Alabama offensive tackle D.J. Fluker, Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o and Cal wide receiver Keenan Allen. The Chargers really nailed it with these picks. Fluker will start right away and will probably develop into a solid left tackle. Te’o was a projected first rounder but fell all the way to the Chargers at 38th overall. Look for all three of these picks to contribute right away in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Green Bay Packers:</p>\n<p>The Packers need to protect Aaron Rodgers, develop a better running game and shore up their aging defense. So what did they do? Drafted a beast of a defensive end from UCLA in Datone Jones, selected two offensive linemen and locked up two of the best running backs in the draft with Alabama’s Eddie Lacy and UCLA’s Johnathan Franklin. With these players and their other draft selections, the Packers did a beautiful job at filling the team’s needs. However, Green Bay does need to find an answer to the departures of defensive back Charles Woodson and wide receiver Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings:</p>\n<p>The Vikings made the most out of their three first round picks. The Vikings needed help on defense and at the wide receiver position after the departure of wide receiver Percy Harvin. At 23rd overall, they drafted an absolute stud in defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd, who many projected to be a top-10 selection. Then they grabbed cornerback Xavier Rhodes out of Florida St. Rhodes is a physical player, who also possesses good ball skills. At 29th overall, Minnesota filled Harvin’s spot with Tennessee wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson. Patterson is 6’2”, 216 pounds and can jump out of stadium; however, he did only play one year of big time college football after transferring from the junior college ranks. Nonetheless, the Vikings are a much better team now with Patterson lining up with new acquisition Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Philadelphia Eagles:</p>\n<p>After a few years of controversy and rumors, the Eagles finally parted ways with Head Coach Andy Reid after fourteen seasons. Now the man calling the shots is former Oregon Head Coach Chip Kelly. Kelly is thought of around football as an offensive genius who is going to try to bring his patented style of lightning quick offense to the NFL.</p>\n<p>With the fourth overall pick, the Eagles went with Oklahoma offensive tackle Lane Johnson. Johnson makes sense because he played in a similar quick tempo offense in college. Johnson is a freak athlete who converted to tackle after playing quarterback in high school. Philadelphia then went on to take Stanford tight end Zach Ertz who can do a lot of things on the offensive side of the ball. He is a tough, versatile athlete who will fit into Kelly’s offense nicely.</p>\n<p>With the first pick in the fourth round, the Eagles shocked a lot of people by drafting USC quarterback Matt Barkley. Barkley’s stock plummeted in his final year of college after he would have likely been a top-10 pick in the 2012 draft. Barkley’s arrival brings a lot of attention to the QB situation in Philadelphia. Is Michael Vick the right fit for Kelly’s spread offense? Or it could be either Nick Foles or Barkley, who are more pocket passers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oakland Raiders:</p>\n<p>The first five teams that I mentioned all had great drafts. The Oakland Raiders, unfortunately, did not. While the Raiders’ woeful roster management should come as no surprise, they just continue to baffle me.</p>\n<p>The Raiders ended up taking D.J. Hayden, a cornerback out of Houston, with the 12th overall pick. Hayden is a great story because he almost lost his life in college after a knee to the chest caused immense internal bleeding. But if you are the Raiders and you want to take a cornerback, how about just staying at the third overall pick and select Alabama’s Dee Milliner? Milliner is a player you can build your defense around, but instead the Raiders traded down to gamble on a player who may never play a down of professional football.</p>\n<p>So, with the 2013 NFL draft in the books we can all look forward to the Ravens-Broncos game on opening night, another New York Jets quarterback controversy and another year of Tony Romo playing quarterback for the Cowboys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1624917340\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51102\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51103\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/eric-fisher/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=486%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"486,560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Fisher\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=217%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=486%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51103\" alt=\"Eric Fisher\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher-216x250.jpg?resize=216%2C250\" width=\"216\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 30, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Anna Xu of The Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51102\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51102\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/","id":3187,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3186,3185,3184],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Germany Taking Over Soccer","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/robert-lewandowski-gtrt.org_.jpg?resize=298%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/robert-lewandowski-gtrt.org_.jpg?resize=298%2C295&ssl=1","description":"The semi-final round of the UEFA Champion’s League is underway, and the two German teams are attempting a coup d’état of the Spanish soccer dominance.

He didn’t score, but his presence on the field commands so much respect that it opens space for Andres Iniesta and David Villa. The second and final game for this match up will be on May 1, at Camp Nou in Barcelona.</p>\n<p>In Borussia Dortmund’s win on Wednesday, the formula was no secret. Real Madrid was beaten by Robert Lewandowski. Whether it be the toughness around the net on a corner set piece or his shifty footwork followed by a beautiful top shelf shot, each one of his four goals put a particular scoring trait on display. Although Christiano Ronaldo did score a valuable away goal in the 43rd minute, Dortmund shouldn’t be too worried because they are now 2-0-1 this year against Real Madrid.</p>\n<p>In order to overturn the momentum and beat Dortmund, Real Madrid will have to play a much better team game the second time around. Even after they were up by three goals, Dortmund kept on the offensive attack because they had so much confidence in their team play. Real Madrid was just trying to set up Ronaldo with a long pass or out run them up and down the field. We will find out whether Madrid can score three goals and move on to the finals on April 30 at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid.</p>\n<p>While these deficits are imposing, Real Madrid and Barcelona are certainly capable of re-capturing their magic and turning it into a ticket to the championship round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of gtrt.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/","id":3186,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3185,3184,3183],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Solving the ‘Hack-a-Howard’ Dilemma","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dwight-howard-trendingsearches.net_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dwight-howard-trendingsearches.net_.jpg?resize=560%2C421&ssl=1","description":"Earlier this season, on March 12 to be exact, Dwight Howard tied his own NBA record for most free throws shot in a game with 39 attempts against the Orlando Magic.

After all, he shot over 15 percent better than his regular season average of 49.2 percent. But is this really something people should be commending?</p>\n<p>During the 2012-13 regular season, Howard shot 721 free throws and made only 355 of them. The 721 attempts are the most free throws shot by a center in the league by a long shot. DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings shot the second highest amount of free throws of any center in the NBA and he took 423. In the NBA as a whole, Howard ranks second in free throws per game with 9.5.</p>\n<p>With such a poor free throw percentage, teams have become smart, creating the Hack-a-Howard phenomena. It’s not completely new; it wasn’t rare that opponents would hack former Laker Shaquille O’Neal (of course termed Hack-a-Shaq). Unlike with Shaq, who was grabbed once he received the ball, teams are now fouling Howard off the ball.</p>\n<p>Intentional fouling off the ball can only be done until the final two minutes of the game, at which point it is no longer allowed. Up until that point, Howard becomes an extreme liability on the court.</p>\n<p>In the defense of Howard, he isn’t the only one being hacked. DeAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers is receiving the same treatment, as he is one of the worst foul shooters in the league at a dismal 38.6 percent from the charity stripe. However, Howard draws much more attention, partly because of his star status, partly because he’s a Laker and also because the Clippers have a backup for Jordan, whereas the Lakers have no solid sub for Howard. As a result, Jordan shot just 249 free throws this season, about a third of what Howard shot.</p>\n<p>Many basketball fans (Lakers’ fans specifically) are questioning if a rule should be implemented to stop the hacking, but really, there is no answer. Fouling off the ball is not allowed in final two minutes of the game, putting an end to the Hack-a-Howard, but to make a rule where you can’t foul off the ball during the entire game would be ridiculous and would question the integrity of the game.</p>\n<p>There’s already a six-foul disqualification rule for a reason. Fouling off the ball happens and is valid. Besides, there is no reason to make a rule for basically one player. What L.A. fans need to realize is that the rule is not the problem, Howard is.</p>\n<p>Free throws are about three key concepts: mental toughness, muscle memory and hard work. A player has to put in the time at the gym to get it right.</p>\n<p>This year, Howard made approximately $20 million. There is absolutely no reason that a player making millions of dollars should get away with this. He’s being paid to play a sport that he should love and if being paid that much, to do it well. Let’s be honest, a high school basketball player, on average, shoots a better percentage than Howard. Hire a coach or do whatever you have to do, but there is no excuse to make less than half of your free throws.</p>\n<p>So do I like the Hack-a-Howard strategy? No. After all, basketball is a game for entertainment.</p>\n<p>However, I’m not going to deny it as a valid strategy. Basketball is about exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses and while Dwight brings a lot of positive aspects to the game, he is a downright horrible free throw shooter.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Hack-a-Howard is a valid option for teams. If down, you save time on the clock, earn more possessions and, chances are, you’re going to have the opportunity to gain ground on the Lakers. In his 76 games this season, Howard missed an average of five free throws per game. That can give any team the momentum it needs to turn the ball game around. And if you do have a lead, you’re taking away the option of the Lakers finding a better and more reliable shot, like from Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Basketball is about making other team adjust and the Lakers will have to do that. If a team starts to hack, take Dwight off the floor. That’s what the Clippers do with Jordan. However, Howard’s contract ends after this year and he will become a free agent, so the Lakers have to keep him happy and, as a result, leave him on the floor.</p>\n<p>Really though, allowing Howard to stay on the floor does nothing for his team. His teammates, coaches and the city of Los Angeles clearly have no confidence in him, so it’s not helping to build team chemistry. The missed free throws simply cause frustration. Plus, they’re obviously not helping the Lakers win ball games.</p>\n<p>If you must, keep Howard happy for this season, but if the Lakers (or whatever new team) re-sign him, they should put him on the bench when opponents start to hack. He doesn’t deserve to be on the floor if he can’t make free throws. It’s not any different from the end of a ball game and you’re up one with the ball, so you put your best free throw shooters on the floor. If Howard’s not one of them, sit him on the bench.</p>\n<p>From an early age, players are taught that free throws can win or lose games. Howard needs to figure that out if L.A. wants to win.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of trendingsearches.net</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/","id":3182,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3181,3180,3179],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2013 NFL Draft Full of Linemen","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The NFL draft begins on Thursday and will conclude on Saturday in what will be a marathon of a three-day event where many teams will fill their biggest needs with promising young stars.

Last season, five rookie quarterbacks started in the first week of the season. This year, however, there is a lack of elite quarterback prospects, with the majority of the top players in this year’s draft sitting on the defensive side of the ball. Linemen on both sides of the ball will be the story of the 2013 NFL draft.

With this pick, Kansas City can solidify the important left tackle position to protect their recent investment in former 49ers quarterback Alex Smith. Joeckel gives the Chiefs a dominant and well-balanced blocker who can give the quarterback time and open up lanes for running back Jamaal Charles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jacksonville Jaguars: Dion Jordan, DE/OLB, Oregon</p>\n<p>Jacksonville could go a number of ways here but, as has been the sentiment for what seems like the past decade, the Jaguars need help in the pass rush. Jordan is one of the best athletes in this year’s draft and is a proven commodity with his level of production for a successful Oregon program. He can definitely help to improve Jacksonville’s pass rush and switch between defensive end and outside linebacker.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oakland Raiders: Sharrif Floyd, DT, Florida</p>\n<p>After a few mediocre seasons in which they showed signs of life, Oakland returned to the bottom tier of the NFL once again after a disappointing season. The Raiders have a number of needs and could look at Geno Smith here, but that pick would be a reach so I have them taking Floyd, a dominant run stopping defensive tackle who can help the Raiders bulk up along the defensive line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Philadelphia Eagles: Eric Fisher, OT, Central Michigan</p>\n<p>So much for new head coach Chip Kelly making a giant splash with his first pick in the draft. Pressure is on the Eagles to find a new franchise quarterback in Geno Smith, but Smith would once again be a reach here. Fisher would provide the Eagles with a solid tackle that can play on either the right or the left side and help protect whoever Philadelphia decides to run out at quarterback. Maybe Philly makes a move later in the draft to get Geno.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Detroit Lions: Dee Milliner, CB, Alabama</p>\n<p>Cornerback isn’t the most pressing need for the Lions, but it certainly couldn’t hurt to have a defensive stopper like Milliner, especially in a division where the Lions must face the Packers and Aaron Rodgers twice a season. If Fisher is available here, I think the Lions’ priority is finding pass protectors to keep Matthew Stafford upright and healthy, but, in this case, Milliner is the choice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cleveland Browns: Ezekiel Ansah, DE, BYU</p>\n<p>Ansah is a raw prospect with as much potential as anyone in this year’s draft, but he is somewhat unproven. Cleveland needs help with the pass rush and Ansah seems like the player with the highest potential reward. He is a freak of an athlete that can really help provide the Browns with a defensive presence to create havoc for opposing quarterbacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Arizona Cardinals: Lane Johnson, OT, Oklahoma</p>\n<p>This draft is full of impressive linemen on both sides of the ball and it shows with the third offensive linemen taken already. Arizona doesn’t need a quarterback now that they have Carson Palmer, so the Cardinals should focus on improving the offensive line. Johnson is the best available prospect in terms of value and need. He may not be as talented as Joeckel or Fisher, but Johnson presents a solid prospect that can help to solidify a weak Arizona line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Buffalo Bills: Chance Warmack, OG, Alabama</p>\n<p>Warmack is one of the most impressive offensive guard prospects in the last several years and will help Buffalo to establish a pretty good offensive line. The Bills could reach for a quarterback here so Ryan Nassib makes sense for Buffalo, but not this early in the draft. Look for Buffalo to address the quarterback situation in the second round or trade up into the later parts of the second round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Jets: Barkevious Mingo, DE/OLB, LSU</p>\n<p>The Jets sucked last year and that mainly falls on the lack of quality quarterback play. Unless the Jets find a match with either one of their two first round picks, they may stick with Mark Sanchez for another season and help to reload what used to be a scary defense. Mingo adds versatility to a Jets defense that is in need of an intimidating pass-rusher, especially when facing Tom Brady twice a season. Without Darrelle Revis, the Jets need to refocus on bringing back that defensive mindset that helped them advance to the AFC Championship two years in a row.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tennessee Titans: Jonathan Cooper, OG, North Carolina</p>\n<p>Cooper is a more athletic guard than Warmack and can provide the Titans with a solid player to help create room for Chris Johnson. Cooper’s athleticism will prove valuable when he is pulling downfield and setting up blocks for Johnson. Tennessee needs pass rushing help and could look at Star Lotulelei, but the defensive tackle is more of a run-stopping specialist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall, I’m projecting five offensive linemen and four defensive linemen to go in the top 10 with the only non-linemen being Dee Milliner. This draft class is obviously rich with linemen on both sides of the ball. I feel that no teams will choose a quarterback in the early parts of the first round and will instead wait to either trade up into the first round or wait until the second round to find their man.</p>\n<p>Quarterback is the most important position in the game, but there is no sense in forcing a pick when there are talented linemen galore available. However the draft shakes out on Thursday, be sure there will be surprises aplenty. This year’s NFL draft is as hard to predict as any in the last decade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2015883844\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50984\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50985\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/2013-nfl-draft-full-of-linemen/eagles-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Eagles Art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50985\" alt=\"Eagles Art\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of April 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Campaigned as the “3 to See,” Brittany Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins will make an immediate impact on the women’s game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Brittany Griner</span></b></p>\n<p>Griner has become a household name in the basketball world with her 6’8’’ frame. With a wingspan longer than that of Andrew Bynum, Griner brings a presence that the WNBA has never seen before. Yes, there have been taller players than Griner to play in the WNBA, but none that can jump or have the talent of Griner.</p>\n<p>Coming from Baylor University, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind, including Griner’s, that she would be going as the No. 1 pick to the Phoenix Mercury. General Manager and Head Coach Corey Gaines knew as well, even if he tried not to admit it.</p>\n<p>The accolades for Griner are numerous. She set an NCAA record for blocked shots, ranks second on the all-time scoring list, tallied a 50-point performance last season and led the Lady Bears to a perfect, unprecedented 40-0 season in 2011-12. Not to mention, she’s already dunked 18 times. And these are real dunks.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Griner will change the game with her dunking and blocking ability. Heading to Phoenix, there was an initial question of whether she would fit in with the Mercury’s run and gun high-paced offense. However, Griner’s rebounding ability will only jumpstart Phoenix’s break and give them a post presence in the half court set they’ve yet to have.</p>\n<p>Plus, for a team that doesn’t focus on defense, Griner’s blocking ability will only help the Mercury execute its game plan: outscore the opponent.</p>\n<p>For the first time in years, all the attention will not be on Griner. The game will be more physical for her, but she won’t have the constant triple team she’s accustomed to. The reason for that is that Phoenix also happens to feature the No. 1 player in the world — and I’m not talking about Griner.</p>\n<p>Diana Taurasi is back this season after missing last season with a hip flexor injury. She’s the best scorer in the world and can knock down the three-point shot from NBA range, which will allow Griner freedom down low.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to bet on who will win the WNBA championship this early, especially with the defending champion Indiana Fever returning its core group, but it is certain that Phoenix should dominate the Western Conference and be contending for a WNBA championship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Elena Delle Donne</span></b></p>\n<p>After this year’s NCAA Tournament, Delle Donne has become America’s sweetheart in a women’s basketball jersey.</p>\n<p>She boasts a phenomenal story, signing with Connecticut after becoming one of the top high school recruits in the country only to leave overnight during the summer without telling anyone due to homesickness. She wasn’t enjoying basketball anymore and stepped away from the game.</p>\n<p>Thankfully for women’s basketball, Delle Donne did return to basketball, but this time for Delaware, the college close to home.</p>\n<p>Dominating for the Fighting Blue Hens, Delle Donne led her team to the school’s first ever Sweet 16 performance, going in as the underdog and defeating great teams like North Carolina.</p>\n<p>Like Griner, Delle Donne is used to seeing double and triple teams on a nightly basis, but what sets Delle Donne apart is her versatility. Delle Donne is 6’5’’ and can easily body up down low, but she also has a spectacular three-point shot and the ball handling skills of a guard.</p>\n<p>She finished fifth on the all-time NCAA scoring list, finishing with over 3,000 points, which is remarkable considering she missed time on the court during her career due to Lyme Disease.</p>\n<p>She’s a player unlike anybody the women’s game has ever seen before, almost resembling a combination of Lauren Jackson and Diana Taurasi — which says a lot considering those are the best two players in the women’s game today.</p>\n<p>Delle Donne will join the Chicago Sky, a team with potential that has also never made the playoffs. Playing with the great inside presence of Sylvia Fowles and young guards like Courtney Vandersloot and Epiphanny Prince, Delle Donne will fill a large role in the forward position and should mesh well with Swin Cash on the wing.</p>\n<p>Despite the recent media attention that comes with her success, Delle Donne still remains an underrated player after playing at a smaller college. But look out Eastern Conference, she’s ready to play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Skylar Diggins</span></b></p>\n<p>Notre Dame’s all-time leading scorer, Diggins brought the Fighting Irish back into the national spotlight in women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>While she leaves without a national championship, Diggins is the future point guard in the WNBA.</p>\n<p>A solid all-around player, Diggins has great range on her shot, but also can be deceptively quick getting into the lane, showing essences of a Becky Hammon-like guard.</p>\n<p>However, Diggins also gets it done on the defensive end and is known for picking the pocket of her opponents’ point guard, leading to easy layups on the other end.</p>\n<p>As equally important as her play, though, is her leadership. For Notre Dame, Diggins was always the player to get her teammates fired up and has a competitive spirit unmatched by any other rookie this year.</p>\n<p>Selected as the No. 3 draft pick to the Tulsa Shock, Diggins goes to a team that will probably surprise people this season. Tulsa has yet to find success since its days in Detroit and finished last in the Western Conference the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>However, they are a completely different team than last season, and Diggins will fill a role much needed by the Shock. She will facilitate an offense with plenty of talent, playing beside Stanford grads Candice Wiggins, Nicole Powell and Kayla Pedersen. All will be great options for Diggins on the drive and dish, or she can lob the ball down low to the young Australian, Liz Cambage, who, by the way, is also 6’8’’.</p>\n<p>She may be a rookie, but this point guard could lead the Shock to its first successful season. Already beyond her years, this team will belong to Diggins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With all bringing something different to the table, Griner, Delle Donne and Diggins have created a buzz around the WNBA this season.</p>\n<p>The WNBA is continuously improving and showing the capability of women as basketball players. With every year, the league brings in more and more talent, and this rookie class is absolutely no exception.</p>\n<p>For a still very young league, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear int eh print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50929\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50929\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/","id":3184,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3183,3182,3181],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"History Made in the 2013 Masters Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"He can’t win the big one.

He is good, but he will never win a major. He doesn’t have the clutch gene. These are only a few of the many criticisms that Adam Scott dismissed with his Master’s win this past Sunday.</p>\n<p>When his 12-foot birdie putt found the bottom of the cup on the second playoff hole, Scott clinched his first Major Championship win and eliminated previous winner Angel Cabrera. This winning putt, along with his 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole of regulation, will be remembered as two of the greatest putts in Master’s history.</p>\n<p>Those putts, and his final score of -9 in 74 holes, did not look anything at all like the play of an “un-clutch” player. So now, Australia has its first Master’s championship and Adam Scott has his first major victory.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Scott’s historic run was not the only thing that made the 2013 Masters exceptional. This year golf fans were treated to the youngest participant in history and a controversial ruling regarding the No. 1 player in the world. That’s right, 14-year-old Tianlang Guan of China was not only the youngest participant ever, he made the cut and won the Silver Cup. The Silver Cup is the trophy awarded to the tournament’s “low amateur,” or the amateur who posts the best four-day score in the tournament.</p>\n<p>The excitement surrounding Guan didn’t end there. On Friday, Guan became the first player in Master’s history to incur a penalty for slow play. Rules officials said that he was warned about his pace numerous times on the back nine and was finally assessed a penalty on the 17th hole.</p>\n<p>As for the controversy regarding the No. 1 ranked player in the world, Tiger Woods was assessed a two-stoke penalty for an illegal drop. On Friday at the fifteenth hole, Woods was chipping onto the green when his ball hit the flagstick and rolled into the water. Woods then elected to take a drop at the spot of his original chip; unfortunately, he dropped the ball two yards behind the original spot.</p>\n<p>What was controversial about it was that the rules committee assessed the penalty over night instead of on the course. That means that Woods signed an incorrect scorecard on Friday, which should result in an automatic disqualification. However, Rule 33 states that the rules committee can waive a disqualification in certain cases.</p>\n<p>The fact that the committee penalized Woods over night instead of during his round led them to waive his disqualification. Woods said later that he did not know he was breaking the rule by dropping the ball about two-yards behind the spot.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Woods finished at -5 and his major championship victory drought has now extended to 15 tournaments. Did the two stroke penalty cost Tiger a real shot at competing with Scott and Cabrera on the final day? We will never know.</p>\n<p>What we do know is that Tiger is getting closer to a major championship and to Jack Nicklaus’ record of 20 career major victories.</p>\n<p>As for the 2013 Masters, however, Tiger and the rest of the field could only watch as last year’s champion Bubba Watson presented Adam Scott with his Green Jacket and Scott immortalized himself into a legend for Australia and as a Masters Champion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 16, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/","id":3183,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3182,3181,3180],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Clippers are the Team to Beat in LA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clips.jpg?resize=250%2C156&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clips.jpg?resize=250%2C156&ssl=1","description":"The Los Angeles Lakers have always dominated basketball in L.A., overshadowing the Clippers and stealing the attention.

After the Slam Dunk Competition in 2011, any basketball fan knows he is explosive and can jump.</p>\n<p>But he’s also extremely strong and surprisingly quick for a big man, allowing him to get deep into the lane and finish. As he continues to work on his outside game, Griffin is certain to become one of the best players in this league.</p>\n<p>However, even with Griffin, the team would not be great if it weren’t for its floor general in Chris Paul. Paul is such a unique player nowadays, being one of the few true point guards remaining in the game. His ball-handling skills and quickness make him a very fun player to watch and at times he can be too unselfish.</p>\n<p>With his finesse in the lane, CP3 nearly averages a double-double with 17.0 points and 9.2 assists. An MVP candidate for much of this season, he is a nearly impossible match-up for any team.</p>\n<p>Unlike many teams in the NBA, the Clippers have then surrounded their stars with a mix of solid players. They have balance, combining veterans with young rising stars, defensive players with offensive ones as every player knows his role.</p>\n<p>For example, Jamal Crawford averages 16.7 points per game this season, adding another huge offensive threat to the team.</p>\n<p>Caron Butler adds another ball-handler and three-point threat as he averages 38.5 percent shooting from behind the arc this season. This spreads the floor, allowing an open lane for Griffin or Paul on the drive. Chauncey Billups, AKA Mr. Big Shot, can knock down the long ball too and adds another veteran leader as an option for Head Coach Vinny Del Negro.</p>\n<p>Then, there’s Matt Barnes, who had jumped around from team to team over the course of his career, but definitely seems to fit with the Clippers. He does average double-figure scoring, but Barnes brings an edge to the team and will always scramble for the loose balls.</p>\n<p>One of the Clippers’ most improved players is DeAndre Jordan. The man is certainly athletic, as shown by his monster dunk over Brandon Knight in March, but Jordan brings a solid defensive presence more than anything. He leads the team this season in blocks with 1.3 per game, serving as that important force in the key that makes any player think twice about going to the basket.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Clippers are finally a force to be reckoned with in the NBA. While the Lakers might be the team that continues to get a lot of media coverage, it’s the Los Angeles team in the red, white and blue that has the best chance to make some noise come playoff time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50812\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50812\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/","id":3181,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3180,3179,3178],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Top Performers After Week one of the MLB Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Major League baseball season is underway and the players are already treating fans with some unbelievable sights and stories.

He set a MLB record with 16 RBIs in his team’s first four games and was also named AL Player of the Week for his efforts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The man patrolling centerfield for the Orioles hasn’t started off too bad either. His name is Adam Jones and he is an emerging superstar. He is hitting .522 (15-30) with four doubles, one home run and eight RBIs. If the Orioles are going to repeat their success in the AL East from a year ago, they will need to pitch as well as they are hitting.</p>\n<p>Down in Atlanta, the Braves and Justin Upton are flexing their muscles in the NL East. Upton is hitting .423 with eight RBIs and leads the MLB with six home runs.</p>\n<p>The Braves are also getting some great production from their young first baseman Freddie Freeman. Before a trip to the 15-day disabled list for an oblique strain, Freeman was hitting .412 with seven RBIs in only five games. After the retirement of Chipper Jones, Freeman is slowly becoming one of the faces of the franchise.</p>\n<p>Atlanta certainly has the roster to challenge the Washington Nationals from clinching a second consecutive AL East title despite solid performances from youngsters such as Bryce Harper.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to have a better week than Clayton Kershaw had. He went 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA and a minute .44 WHIP. In their first game with the game tied at zero, Kershaw blasted a home run to go along with a complete game shutout. He was named NL Player of the Week and has Dodger fans thinking about a deep playoff run.</p>\n<p>Overall, Kershaw has led a dominant Dodgers pitching staff that has allowed a mere six runs in six games, good for a 1.00 ERA, by far tops in the majors. Whether or not the rest of the lineup can support the pitching staff with run support is another question.</p>\n<p>After a disappointing season last year, the Red Sox have put that all behind them. Clay Buchholz and Jon Lester are dominating on the mound. They have combined for three wins and have allowed only three earned runs.</p>\n<p>Their young third baseman Will Middlebrooks, is turning into a star. On Sunday, Middlebrooks hit three home runs and flied out to the warning track in his final at-bat.</p>\n<p>In an AL East that has no clear cut front-runner, Boston may be able to put together enough wins for a division title despite the firesale they displayed during last season’s trade deadline. Look for these players to put up some monster seasons and hopefully avoid the injury bug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 9, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/","id":2116,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[2115,2114,2113],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The NBA Playoff Picture","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With the beginning of April comes an end to college basketball.

March Madness will officially come to a close next Tuesday, but basketball fans should have no reason to worry. Why? Because just a little over a week down the road begins the NBA playoffs.</p>\n<p>Slated to begin April 21, most teams have about seven games remaining in their regular season. This means crunch time for several teams looking to secure those last few playoff spots.</p>\n<p>In the East, the teams that will enter the postseason are pretty much locked up. After its 27-game win streak, the Miami Heat has secured the top seed in the Eastern Conference and probably in the league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Teams one through seven have guaranteed their spots in postseason play. The only team not locked in is Milwaukee, but with a six-game lead over ninth-place Philadelphia, there’s very little chance that the Bucks won’t be part of the playoffs.</p>\n<p>The rest of the teams may see changes in seeding, but overall, the East is set and should be very exciting heading into playoffs. While the conference will be Miami’s to win or lose (and it would be extremely surprising if they don’t win), seeds two through seven are all extremely competitive and should feature some very competitive series.</p>\n<p>The West, on the other hand, is a very different story.</p>\n<p>At the top of the conference, San Antonio and Oklahoma City are still neck and neck. Personally, I don’t really think it matters who wins the conference because in the end, the Thunder’s youth and athleticism will be too much to handle for even a great veteran team like the Spurs.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the Western Conference, though, features a very tight race for that coveted eighth spot. It looks like Houston will take seventh, but the fight for the last spot comes down to Los Angeles and Utah.</p>\n<p>The Lakers currently hold the eighth seed at 39-36. Just a half-game behind is the Jazz at 39-37, who would win the tiebreaker if the two teams were to tie.</p>\n<p>L.A. comes off a crucial victory Tuesday night against Dallas in which it won convincingly 101-81. The win was not only important to take the lead over the Jazz, but also created a two-and-a-half game gap between Dallas and a playoff spot, making it just a two-man race to enter the postseason.</p>\n<p>Utah has won five of its last six, but neither team has an easy schedule down the stretch. Utah has six games remaining, the Lakers seven, and both teams have only Western Conference teams remaining on the schedule. For both teams, the majority of their opponents coming up are seeded higher and they will play three of the same opponents, so in this case, the best team should win.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I give the advantage to the Lakers. The first reason is because they have more games at home to end the regular season. Los Angeles will play five of its final seven games at home, which gives it an edge over its tougher competition. Utah, meanwhile, will only play three of its final six games at home.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Lakers have Kobe Bryant. Love him or hate him, the guy knows how to play under pressure. He’s got six rings and I’m sure has no plans of sitting out the best time of the year for a pro basketball player.</p>\n<p>He’s averaging 27.0 points per game, third best in the NBA, and if it weren’t for his team’s subpar year that didn’t come close to meeting the large expectations put upon the star-packed Lakers, and LeBron James, Bryant would be considered in the MVP voting.</p>\n<p>For the most part, the team has gained all its pieces back too. Steve Nash continues to sit out with hip and hamstring injuries, but quite honestly, the Lakers are just as good without Nash as they are with him. Without Nash, Bryant becomes not just a scorer, but also the facilitator, and the Lakers have been very good when Bryant breaks into single digits in the assist category.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how the Lakers do with both Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol healthy and on the floor together, but in the end, the team just has too much talent. Someone (aka Bryant) will step up and lead the Lakers into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Like in the East though, I don’t think it really matters who takes the final spot when it comes down to who will play in the NBA Finals. Oklahoma City and San Antonio will most likely be the two teams competing for the chance to play Miami, as they have been the superior teams in the West all season long.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for any teams at the bottom of either conference, this isn’t March Madness. It takes four games to defeat a team in a series and playing that one miracle game won’t get you very far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/","id":2114,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2113,2112,2111],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Sports Examines Hottest Teams in the NHL","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NHL.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NHL.jpg?resize=666%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The National Hockey League is back and the painfully long off-season lockout seems like ancient history.

Although this season will only feature 48 games, it is proving to be worth the 119 day wait. The Blackhawks have earned a point in 28 straight games dating back to last season, making them tied for the second longest streak in league history. The Los Angeles Kings are playing very well recently, and Coach Darryl Sutter will have his team ready to defend Lord Stanley’s Cup. On the other side of the country, the fans in Pittsburgh are ecstatic to have Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin healthy and playing together again. These exciting storylines and record setting performances are crucial for the league to retain its integrity after an ugly offseason. Here is a review of some of the hottest teams and best players so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chicago Blackhawks</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just when it looked like the Blackhawks were finally going to lose in regulation this season, Patrick Kane netted a goal with 2:02 left in the final period of last Sunday’s game against the Red Wings. Then, Kane carried his team to a victory in an overtime shootout when he beat Detroit’s goaltender Jimmy Howard with a multiple-deke move.</p>\n<p>Kane is leading the team in goals, assists and overall points with 11, 15 and 26, respectively. If the Blackhawks continue their dominance and Kane keeps up this type of performance, he will be a strong contender for MVP.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goaltender Corey Crawford leads the league in average goals allowed with a stingy 1.41 per game. The Blackhawks also boast the best goal differential in the league at +29 and have allowed the fewest goals overall (41). Chicago plays will round out this week with two games against the Avalanche and one against the Oilers on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anaheim Ducks</p>\n<p>After missing the playoffs last season, the Ducks have played much better hockey so far this season. They are second in the entire league with 33 points and are 7-2-1 in their last ten games.</p>\n<p>They do not have a dominant offensive scorer, but they can pass the puck. Six players have eleven or more assists, and ten players have five or more goals. Captain Ryan Getzlaf leads the team in goals(8), assists(17), and overall points(25).</p>\n<p>As for the men tending the goal, Viktor Fasth is 9-1 with an average of 2.08 goals allowed per game. Also, veteran Jonas Hiller is averaging a surprisingly high 3.24 goals allowed per game. The Ducks have lost consecutive games to the Coyotes, 5-4 in shootouts. Their next three games will be at home against the Coyotes, Flames and Blues.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p>The defending Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings got off to a rough 3-7 start this season. However, Anze Kopitar and the rest of the Kings have won eight of their last ten games.</p>\n<p>Kopitar leads the team in points with 18, while fellow center Jeff Carter is first on the team and tied for second in the league with 14 goals. In the Kings 5-1 win over the Predators on Monday, Carter completed his fifth career hat trick with two goals within a 19 second span in the final period.</p>\n<p>After putting together one of the greatest post season performances ever last season, goaltender Jonathan Quick has struggled this season. He is a meager 6-6 this season and is allowing an average of 2.54 goals per game. Recently the Kings have been mixing in Jonathan Bernier between the pipes. Bernier is 5-1 this season as the goaltender and is allowing an average of 1.53 goals per game. The Kings have three more games on this homestand and then travel to play the Coyotes and Sharks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the Penguins have their superstars healthy and scoring the puck. As a team, they are second in the Eastern Conference and lead the league in average goals per game with 3.48.</p>\n<p>Sidney Crosby is leading the league in points with 36, and assists with 25. Right behind him is the Penguins left wing Chris Kunitz, who is second in the league with 28 points and first in plus-minus with 17. In addition to Kunitz and Crosby, they have seven other players with ten or more points this season. Left wing James Neal is tied for second in the league with 14 goals and Malkin is tied for fourth in the league with 18 assists.</p>\n<p>Their goaltender, Marc-Andre Fleury, is tied for the lead league in wins with 11 and is allowing an average of 2.44 goals per game. The Penguins are 7-3 in their last ten games and if their defense improves they will be a tough out in the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Montreal Canadiens</p>\n<p>The Canadiens are in first place in the Eastern Conference with 32 points. They are 7-3 in their last ten games and are allowing the fifth least amount of goals per game with 2.32.</p>\n<p>Goaltender Carey Price is tied for second in the league with 11 wins and tied for second in shutouts with two. After finishing in 28th place last season, the Canadiens have turned the page and are firing on all cylinders. In their game against the fourth place Bruins on Sunday, Montreal took advantage of the penalty on Boston’s key defender, Zdeno Chara, to take the lead for good in the third period.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ice, the Canadiens are led by left wing Max Pacioretty, and centers David Desharnais and Tomas Plekanec. They have combined for a total of 49 points this season and are distributing the puck nicely. After yesterday’s game against the Islanders, Montreal will travel to the Hurricanes, Lightning and Panthers this week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Leaders (as of March 4)</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<p>17 – Steven Stamkos, Center, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>14 – James Neal, Left Wing, Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>14 – Jeff Carter, Center, Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assists:</p>\n<p>25 – Sidney Crosby, Center, Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>23 – Martin St. Louis, Right Wing, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>19 – Henrik Zetterberg, Left Wing, Detroit Red Wings</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Points:</p>\n<p>36 – Sidney Crosby, Center Pittsburg Penguins</p>\n<p>34 – Steven Stamkos, Center, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>28 – Chris Kunitz, Left Wing, Pittsburg Penguins</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Artwork by Anna Xu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50513\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50513\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/","id":2115,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[2114,2113,2112],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Seventh Wonder of the World","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a freshman at UCSB, Barbara Nwaba didn’t know what the heptathlon was.

Now, it may be the event that takes her to the Olympics.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always had big dreams and [the heptathlon] is what I think will get me there,” Nwaba said. “I’m so blessed [my coach] put me in it. I feel like it was meant to be.”</p>\n<p>In high school, the redshirt junior from University High School in Los Angeles participated in sprints, the high jump and hurdles. Even during her first season here at UCSB, Nwaba simply specialized in the hurdles. Yet, former Track and Field coach Josh Priester saw something more and began training Nwaba in her sophomore season for the heptathlon, a race that takes place over two days and involves seven events: the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200-meter run, long jump, javelin throw and 800 meter run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Immediately, Nwaba took to the event. She ran her first heptathlon March 13 and 14, 2009 at the Sam Adams Combined Events and earned a score of 4772, breaking the school record of 4767 set by Erika Bornhorst in 1996.</p>\n<p>“My high school coach mentioned [the heptathlon], but I had no idea what it was,” Nwaba said. “Then, [when I was a sophomore], the coach here thought I’d be really good at it. I was really scared, but my first time out I broke the school record, so I was like, ‘I’ll keep with this.’”</p>\n<p>Since then, Nwaba’s success seems endless. In 2010, Nwaba was named an NCAA All-American and broke her own UCSB record twice in the heptathlon, including at the Big West Championships, where Nwaba scored 5,552 and won the event.</p>\n<p>“She’s done so much for the program and you know when she steps onto the track, she’s going to put 110 percent into it,” senior Ryan Martin said. “Pretty much every time she competes, she’s PR’ing. I know she wants to do great things and I think she’s going to.”</p>\n<p>This April at the Sam Adams Multi-Events, Nwaba finished the heptathlon with a phenomenal score of 5,986. The score was not only a personal best for Nwaba, but was good enough to break the overall Big West Conference record. As a result, Nwaba also earned the No. 1 ranking in the nation in the heptathlon.</p>\n<p>“That day was so perfect,” Nwaba said. “Day one went really well — way better than I was expecting. I wasn’t worrying, I was just competing. To see how close I was to 6000, it was a great day.”</p>\n<p>Two weekends ago in the Big West Multi-Event Championships, Nwaba won again with a score of 5,709 and surpassed the conference record set by Sharon Day four years ago in 2008. “I was a little disappointed by the score, but I still broke the record, so I felt I accomplished something,” Nwaba said. “I’ve come a long way. It was good to get a win there because the first time [I competed there,] I came in third.”</p>\n<p>After the victory, Nwaba earned her fourth consecutive Big West Athlete of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>“I remember at the beginning of the year I thought it would be cool to get one [Big West Athlete of the Week award], and now to have four is amazing,” Nwaba said. “I’m happy I’m doing so well this year.”</p>\n<p>While Nwaba has proven to be the best heptathlete to compete at UCSB, she strives for perfection and is never happy with just a win.</p>\n<p>“To get a PR is a good feeling so that reinforces you to keep [training],” Nwaba said. “And I’m competitive with myself.”</p>\n<p>The training is strenuous, but for Nwaba, has always kept practice interesting.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot more hours [of practice] because there are so many events, so it’s so hard to get them all in during the week,” Nwaba said. “It takes a lot of dedication when you have to master seven events, but it’s definitely fun.”</p>\n<p>The determination may pay off, as this summer, Nwaba will have a shot at earning one of three heptathlon spots at the Olympic Games in London. Like most athletes, the Olympics have been the ultimate dream for Nwaba as long as she can remember.</p>\n<p>“In the last Olympics, it [gave] me chills to see [the track athletes] cross the line and win,” Nwaba said. “I want to excel and I know that’s the biggest accomplishment ever, so that pushes me.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba’s dream could very well become a reality. She is currently No. 2 in the nation in the heptathlon behind senior Brianne Theisen. The last two years, Nwaba has also taken a step toward her dream by competing at the USA Nationals. Nwaba placed eighth this year, but knows she can do better.</p>\n<p>“It was defining to be with girls whose scores were so big, but I knew I could do just as well,” Nwaba said. “I started to feel like, ‘I could beat this girl. I can compete with them.’ I didn’t really believe [my dream was possible] until I was competing [there] with the U.S. National Team.”</p>\n<p>Olympic trials will be held in Eugene, Oregon, beginning June 21.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be hard because there are three great heptathletes in the U.S., but she has a chance,” Martin said. “If she competes well in the trials she could do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/","id":3174,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3173,3172,3171],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ex-Gaucho Excels At World Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Former UCSB sprinter and current Olympian bobsledder Nick Cunningham completed his participation in the World Championships this past weekend, driving his rookie team to finish ahead of a slew of expe...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bobsled.jpg?resize=267%2C241\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"241\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Former UCSB sprinter and current Olympian bobsledder Nick Cunningham completed his participation in the World Championships this past weekend, driving his rookie team to finish ahead of a slew of experienced veterans in both the two-and four-man bobsled races.

The team’s total time of 3:39.68 marks Cunningham’s best as a pilot and represents a small sliver of the progressive personal growth that he has undergone since the start of his bobsled career in 2008.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a stepping stone to what I really want to accomplish overall in the sport … not only … to make a statement for myself and my team, but also to see where I stack up,” Cunningham said.</p>\n<p>On top of his experience gained from this past World Championship, Cunningham also had the joy of being able to witness fellow U.S. bobsledding pilot Steve Holcomb and his other USA-1 representatives capture the Olympic gold medal in both the two-and four-man bobsled races. In doing so, Holcomb became the first person in the history of the sport to finish first in every event he participated in.</p>\n<p>“I was actually their alternate when they won the gold medal back in 2009, so to … watch them ultimately come here and make history by winning the two- and four-man, which has never been done before, is just a really cool thing to watch,” Cunningham said. “It’s motivating to me because even though we’re all on different teams we’re all pretty close.”</p>\n<p>Although Cunningham didn’t place as high as he’d originally hoped, there’s no doubt in his mind that he’ll be back again next year, once again competing for another gold medal to add to his already extensive list of accolades.</p>\n<p>“I’m definitely hungry now. I really wanted a top-10 finish … but that’s racing,” Cunningham said. “It won’t always work out there on race days, so I gotta get out there and get ready for the season and always try to get a little bit faster.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Massari wanted to know how the school’s athletic program would get better without better facilities.</p>\n<p>He was right. Our facilities suck. Community colleges look better. Isla Vista Elementary looks better. Even Cal States look better — a fact that escapes the Gaucho Locos that chant “if you can’t go to school, go to State!” like we’re actually superior.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sports do seem to have a common theme. We get close, we upset higher-ranked teams in our conference during irrelevant regular season games and then we lose. The cycle continues. We had an unprecedented two teams (men’s volleyball and club rugby) make the national championships this season and we couldn’t close either game.</p>\n<p>So we debated: Which comes first, the facilities or the team?</p>\n<p>I said the team. Sorry, Massari.</p>\n<p>Money doesn’t care about soccer. Volleyball almost won, but money doesn’t care about volleyball, either. Or women’s sports.</p>\n<p>Money cares about football and men’s basketball. Maybe even baseball. We don’t have a football team, of course, and our basketball team seems content with tournament berths. They’re happy just to be under the nationally televised lights.</p>\n<p>You’re going to tell me that there isn’t one high-major caliber player down to come to UCSB for the beaches and the girls — in spite of some of our shoddier facilities? That nobody wants to be the guy to lead a team from a no-name conference to a Sweet 16? That the first time Gonzaga won a tournament game with a bunch of white guys was because they had superior talent?</p>\n<p>There’s too much complacency amongst some of the athletes and personnel in all Gaucho sports. Conference championships are great, but they should be expected. Dare to be great, like the ads say, and it will happen.</p>\n<p>In spite of the disappointments and a really awkward drive back from Berkeley after soccer lost, my year as a Sports Editor was one of the best and most challenging of my life.

Even on the road in Berkeley for the NCAA second round, our fans were louder than the home team’s. That is fucking awesome. The match was not.</p>\n<p>2) Speaking of the loss to Cal, I saw quite a sight afterwards: Chancellor Henry T. Yang and his lovely wife, Dilling, consoling a tearful Big Mike on the sidelines. I feel like there are a number of interactions between the two that I can picture, but that was never one of them.</p>\n<p>3) Gaucho sports have an identity, and it isn’t a good one. Our teams always seem to have the drive, but not the talent. Or the momentum, but then they stumble. Or they finally make an NCAA Championship, and do not make it over the top. I’ve learned to lower my expectations for big games here, because it’s not worth the emotional investment. Until someone proves me wrong and brings home a trophy, I’m going to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>4) Being the boss is the shit. Since the Nexus is completely run by students, the only person who can tell me what to do is the editor in chief. Telling writers and photographers what to do, where to go and by when is a nice preview for the distant future. Unfortunately, starting the day after graduation, it’s right back to the bottom of the totem pole. It’s been real.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I hope I’ve been a satisfactory sports editor for everyone. Based on the website comments, the only thing we do is make errors, so sometimes I’m not sure. I’m not going to say I gave it 100 percent every day. But you know what? I was hovering around 80 percent for almost most of the time.</p>\n<p>Not too bad, if I do say so myself.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40258\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40258\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/","id":3172,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[3171,3170,3169],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice: The Right to Be Wrong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As surprising as it may seem, I don’t spend all of my time thinking about fantasy baseball.

Josh Johnson, Jon Lester and Roy Halladay have been knocking down fools like bowling pins all season. And since my hitters can’t find their swings, they are the reason my fantasy team is still doing well.</p>\n<p>I was right about a few lesser-known players. Kyle McClellan, though he has started to come back down to earth, is still 5-1 with a 3.62 ERA, making him a great option. Josh Tomlin is also 5-1. He won’t strike out many, but he has yet to let off more than three runs in a start and has given up that many in just two of his eight starts so far.</p>\n<p>I was right about the Red Sox being able to recover from their awful start. Jon Lester and Josh Beckett held that team together through the force of their combined will until the hitting came around. Now that it has, I can confidently return to my Red Sox division title prediction.</p>\n<p>I was right about the San Francisco Giants. To my friends who are Giants fans: try not to get mad, but the Giants suck. Last season’s World Series win was a fluke. True, the Giants are in first place, but seriously, the NL West is a joke.</p>\n<p>I was wrong that drafting fast was the best strategy in fantasy drafts. Yes, it cuts down on draft time and therefore increases the chance that you’ll leave with your sanity intact, but it also increases the chances that you’ll miss out on that one player that could catapult you to the top of your league. If you’re going to take the time to sit through a draft, you might as well do a thorough job of drafting.</p>\n<p>I was wrong about Justin Bieber. I used to think that he was the worst thing to happen to music, but Rebecca Black has proved me wrong. She has convinced me that music is officially dead, and every time I hear her song, which I refuse to mention by name, I die a little bit on the inside.</p>\n<p>I was, unfortunately, right about the NFL labor situation. The lockout is still in effect and there are no signs that it is going to lift anytime soon. I would not be at all surprised if there was no football next season and honestly, that might be good for the NFL. Those rich bastards will learn that their fans aren’t so loyal that they will put up with this nonsense and maybe, just maybe, football will once again become about the fans instead of the money. But probably not.</p>\n<p>Finally, I was wrong that I wouldn’t resort to shameless self-promotion.
