Michael Crabtree started it. All season long, Crabtree has been talking about Sherman and about how overrated he is. He was never quite blatant about it, and most of his comments were said when few people were watching. He surely never said anything on the same stage that Sherman did. But he said it nonetheless, and it was a chip that Sherman carried on his shoulder all season long.</p>\n<p>Then after all that, Sherman still went to congratulate Crabtree on “a hell of a game”. After the final whistle, Sherman went to shake Crabtree’s hand, but his olive branch was met with a hand in the face. Crabtree might be more quiet and passive-aggressive about it, but the unsportsmanlike conduct went both ways and started with Crabtree’s “DeMarcus Cousins-esque” rejection of civility. Imagine what Crabtree would have said about Sherman if Crabtree wasn’t a loser this season.</p>\n<p>So after that, Sherman was a little fired up. He has just made the game-winning play, sending his beloved team to the Super Bowl. The adrenaline was still pumping, and Sherman’s eyes had a fierce, hungry look in them.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He had just proved all his critics wrong, yet, again, but there was still unfinished business to attend to. He wanted it to be perfectly clear to the whole world that his Seahawks were not the underdogs against anyone, including the red-hot 49ers and the mighty Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Sherman has had to defy the odds and make his statement through actions his entire career. Crabtree was a first-round draft pick, Sherman was a fifth-round pick. Crabtree is making top-ten-pick money, while Sherman is making the league minimum.</p>\n<p>Crabtree is being labeled as having the best-hands of all-time, a distinction that completely disrespects previous 49er legends such as Jerry Rice, while Sherman was still an unknown entity to NFL fans even this season. Yet Sherman has been to multiple Pro Bowls and leads the best defense in the NFL, while Crabtree is just a good player on an average offense.</p>\n<p>Even Crabtree’s after-the-fact retort was weak. After the game and the interview, Crabtree tweeted “Film don’t lie. Show me the tape where the guy is the best.” Well Mike, we could show you that tape of the final play of the game a thousand times, and you still won’t get the picture. The fact that there is no other tape besides that play is a testament to the extent of which your quarterback fears Sherman Island.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question: Who do you want on your team? Seattle fans and Sherman’s teammates alike adore their star cornerback. He has demonstrated loyalty, intensity and excellence ever since he came to Seattle, and his trash talking is funny and endearing to everyone who isn’t on the receiving end of it. Pete Carroll approves of Sherman’s aura and believes it inspires the rest of the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>Sherman backs up his trash talk on the field and is a well-spoken, respectful, interesting dude off the field. I don’t think any “thugs”, as Niner fans refer to Sherman, have graduated from Stanford with a GPA hovering around 4.0.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Sherman is the best cornerback in the game, and if his intensity and trash talking in the game are part of what makes him the best in the world, that’s just something fans must live with. The 12th man is behind Sherman every step of the way and love who he is on and off the field.</p>\n<p>While Sherman’s postgame interview might have been a little off-putting to some, it was an extreme and highly publicized moment. It was the culmination of years of adversity being overcome, expressed in the heat of the moment after a positive gesture was rejected. Crabtree needs to shut his mouth and hit the practice field if he wants to say anything about Sherman in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/","id":3250,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3249,3248,3247],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leaders for the Next Great Japanese Pitcher","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Masahiro Tanaka might be the next great Japanese pitcher to come to the MLB.

And no, I’m not talking about Manny Ramirez and his latest comeback bid.</p>\n<p>Of every player getting a new contract or switching teams via trade, none will make the kind of franchise-changing impact over the duration of their deal as Masahiro Tanaka will. The pitching sensation, formerly of the Rakuten Golden Eagles, is the kind of talent who can be built around as a cornerstone for the long haul or be added to a current contender as the final piece on the way to being named World Series favorites.</p>\n<p>Tanaka is just 25 years old and coming off what may be the best season for a pitcher in Japanese Baseball history. He went 24-0 with a 1.27 ERA on way to an MVP award and a Japan Series championship. The superstar from Hyogo started 30 consecutive games without recording a loss, a streak that lasted until his 160-pitch effort in game six of the Japan Series. Tanaka then bounced back to close out game seven and secure a championship for the Golden Eagles.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>From a scouting perspective, Tanaka has the makeup to match the numbers. He stands at 6’2” with a smooth, repeatable delivery that results in pinpoint control (183 strikeouts to 32 walks in 2013).</p>\n<p>Although he doesn’t have the overwhelming power fastball of the other Asian pitcher who came to America in recent memory with this much hype, 6’5” Texas Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish, Tanaka’s heater sits in the low 90’s and comes with a great horizontal slider to offset it. His out-pitch is a split-finger fastball that will instantly be among the best in baseball and bring back memories of Roger Clemens. Like Darvish, Tanaka utilizes a wide repertoire of pitch types to keep hitters off-balance, including off-speed pitches and a variety of cuts and sinking breaks on his fastball.</p>\n<p>In style and professional background, Tanaka resembles Hiroki Kuroda of the Yankees and Hisashi Iwakuma of the Mariners more than Darvish, but the level of success in Japan is more reminiscent of the latter. Given that all three pitchers are Cy Young contenders at their best, Tanaka faces high hopes and expectations. His predecessors established a blueprint for a successful Japan to U.S. transition, and while not every import is a success story (see: Daisuke Matsuzaka), Tanaka has shown the potential to be the greatest of them all.</p>\n<p>The question on everyone’s mind remains: Where will Tanaka sign? The courting process is coming to an end with teams making their pitches and final offers. According to the new international posting rules, Tanaka must sign by Friday, which means he will have to announce his decision by Wednesday in order to allow a couple days for the necessary physical examination.</p>\n<p>Five teams have been named as “finalists” for Tanaka’s services. The New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers are widely regarded as the favorites to sign him, for a variety of reasons. The Yankees are in desperate need of a new ace pitcher and are opening up the checkbook with no further regard for the luxury tax threshold. In previous years, what would have been a sure-thing signing for the Yankees is not so concrete today. They have the money and the need, but Tanaka is said to prefer the west coast. His wife is a pop star in Japan, and the bright lights of Hollywood might affect his decision. If Tanaka wants to play for a contender while also being the unquestioned staff ace, the Yankees might have the edge. If Tanaka wants to play for the best team on paper with no regard for his spot in the rotation, he might choose Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers under Stan Kasten are the new big spenders in baseball and have yet to make a big splash this offseason. Even after signing Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw to long-term contracts, money is still no object for Los Angeles, especially considering they will have the huge contracts of Josh Beckett, Chad Billingsley and Dan Haren off the books by 2015, clearing up over $40 million a year in payroll.</p>\n<p>Kasten worked for the Atlanta Braves during their 1990’s dynasty, when Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz dominated the National League East. He obviously has similar aspirations with this Dodger team, and a rotation of Kershaw, Greinke, Tanaka and Hyun-Jin Ryu would be really difficult to beat in a seven-game series.</p>\n<p>Three other teams, the Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox, have also made offers to Tanaka. Arizona in particular plans to offer every penny they can scrounge up in an attempt to woo Tanaka. The D’Backs need to take their team to the next level to compete with the other juggernauts in the National League West, and getting a great pitcher for the next decade would be a good place to start.</p>\n<p>The Cubs are rebuilding under the guidance of Theo Epstein and would offer Tanaka the chance to slowly adjust to American baseball while comfortably being the face of the franchise when they finally start to contend in a couple years. The White Sox do not have a ton of appeal, but are making a strong push anyway. Consider Seattle and the Los Angeles Angels to be dark horses in the Tanaka sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>Whatever team wins the bidding for Tanaka, expect the deal to average around $20 million a year. Even though he has no MLB experience, $120 million over six years seems like a fair price to pay for a pitcher who is just entering his prime.</p>\n<p>Based on teams’ spending power, ability to contend, location, international marketing appeal and long-term track record, the Dodgers seem to have the slight edge on the Yankees for signing Tanaka. However, nobody will really know his priorities until a decision is made. Based on Tanaka’s Twitter post expressing his inability to reach a final decision, expect the race to come down to a photo finish at the end of the deadline.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of january 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/","id":3251,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3250,3249,3248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"If It’s Broke, Should We Fix It?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Baseball-Hall-of-Fame.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Baseball-Hall-of-Fame.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The MLB Hall-of-Fame Voting System Is Seriously Flawed, and Players are Suffering For It","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The politics of the Hall of Fame voting have created a situation where obviously worthy candidates are being passed over. Baseball fans can blame this on a set of rules (or lack of rules) that makes the voting entirely subjective and seemingly random.</p>\n<p>For those readers who don’t know about the Hall of Fame voting system, here it is: The voting is open to hundreds of sports writers across the nation, most of whom are very familiar with Major League Baseball. Notice that is “MOST,” not ALL. Sports writers who know nothing about the game or its history are still included. Players need a 75 percent vote to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, and they have a 15-year window to be inducted, given that they receive at least the 5 percent needed to stay on the ballot. However, writers can only vote for 10 players on any given year, even if there are more than 10 worthy nominees.</p>\n<p>This is where I take issue with the Hall of Fame vote. Even though baseball is, by its nature, a competitive sport, there does not need to be any sort of competitive element to the Hall of Fame voting. Baseball has one winner and one loser. There is only one championship and players will take their at-bats for 30 innings or more to decide a game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, there is no limit on the number of players that can be inducted into the Hall and the standards of excellence have been established and have evolved for over 100 years. Upon retirement, players should not still be needlessly competing. Let the Hall of Fame stand to honor and immortalize the greatest players of all time, not create drama and debate based on some sports writers’ agendas.</p>\n<p>The weight that has tipped the scales toward the side of flaw is the issue of performance-enhancing drugs. Players who have been caught using steroids and other substances are still included on the ballot with their career numbers intact. They are not even approaching the numbers needed to be inducted, yet they stay on the ballot year after year, stealing votes away from clean players who might otherwise be inducted. While one could make an argument for steroid users being inducted in the Hall of Fame, one must agree that they are being evaluated differently.</p>\n<p>A player who hits 763 home runs should not be receiving 35 percent of the Hall of Fame vote. Intuitively, he should be receiving near 100 percent or 0 percent, depending on whether or not steroid users deserve induction into the Hall of Fame. Of course, everyone has a different opinion on this, which is why the voting numbers come up somewhere in between. But a debate such as this should not interfere with the voting process of clean players. Something is wrong with the system.</p>\n<p>Steroid issues aside, there are players who are obviously being excluded who need to be in, and if a change in the system is necessary, it should be implemented next year. Frank Thomas, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux were all locks and rightfully inducted in their first year of eligibility.</p>\n<p>But what about Craig Biggio? The Houston Astros legend recorded 3,000 hits in his career while playing Gold Glove defense and holding three of the most demanding positions in baseball: catcher, second base and centerfield. Those numbers, combined with his impeccable baseball character, make Biggio’s Hall credentials undoubtable, yet he fell two votes shy of induction. Common sense says he’ll make it next year, but what happens when another crop of bonafide legends (Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz, Gary Sheffield and Nomar Garciaparra) come up on the ballot? The steroid issue will surely not be resolved by next year, and the field will remain crowded.</p>\n<p>And that doesn’t even consider the other 2014 snubs. Mike Piazza of the Dodgers and Mets is the greatest offensive catcher of all-time, yet he fell 13 percent shy of induction this year. Piazza seems like a surefire Hall-of-Famer, yet he was excluded this year because certain baseball writers thought that even though he was worthy, he wasn’t “first-ballot” worthy. Politics like this have skewed the voting for far too long.</p>\n<p>Jeff Bagwell teamed up with Biggio in Houston for years and was one of the best first basemen ever, every bit the equal of his teammate. Curt Schilling of the Phillies, Diamondbacks and Red Sox has the numbers and career success, if not the popularity. Edgar Martinez of the Mariners revolutionized the designated hitter position and with Thomas’ induction this year, the anti-DH argument is now dead.</p>\n<p>Former Tigers pitcher Jack Morris has accumulated over 250 wins, nearly 2,500 strikeouts, all while keeping an ERA at 3.90. He is not a Hall of Fame lock by any means, but his candidacy is overshadowed due to the abundance of worthy nominees created by this logjam. In his last year of eligibility, his vote percentage actually fell 6 percent. If not for the issue of steroid users on the ballot, Morris likely would have been inducted years ago when he wasn’t going against such pitching locks as Maddux and Glavine.</p>\n<p>Lee Smith is one of the greatest closing pitchers of all-time and, after receiving 48 percent of the vote last year, saw his numbers fall below 30 percent this year. Granted, the “saves” statistic and the role of closers in general is controversial, but if a player was a pioneer of the role and is also one of the top five ever at their position, doesn’t that warrant a spot in the Hall?</p>\n<p>Poor Larry Walker of the Rockies and Cardinals is one of the greatest hitters of his generation, accumulating 383 home runs while maintaining a .313 career batting average and a .400 on-base percentage over his 17-year career. Oh yeah, he also garnered seven Gold Gloves and an MVP award. Considering he was never linked to performance-enhancing drugs in the era where they were rampant, at the surface he seems destined for Cooperstown. But Walker struggles to get 10 percent of the vote. Instead of having Hall of Fame goals, he is proud just to be on the ballot year after year.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t even consider worthy candidates with solid credentials like Tim Raines, Jeff Kent and Mike Mussina. These three have also fallen victim to the Hall of Fame problem, failing to get even 50 percent of the vote even though their numbers stack up with previous Hall of Fame players.</p>\n<p>The only reasonable solution is to eliminate the 10-vote limit. This would eliminate the issues of steroid-linked players on the ballot and allow players to be inducted purely based on their baseball merit. Voters who choose to include the likes of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens can do so without excluding the likes of clean Hall-worthy players whose numbers aren’t quite as flashy.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it wouldn’t split the vote among worthy players, thereby eliminating the stalemate that has occurred in recent years. The vote would come down to, “Who is worthy of the Hall of Fame?” a must less subjective question than “Who is most worthy of the Hall of Fame?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53529\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53529\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/","id":3245,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3244,3243,3242],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nothing But the Best Out West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Durant.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Durant.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Grade Breakdown for the NBA's Western Conference","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The NBA is nearing the halfway point in its season and already there is plenty to talk about. Some teams have surprised us, like the Portland Trailblazers; other teams that looked promising have turned out to be massive failures, such as the two teams in New York. One of the biggest stories this season is the domination of the Western Conference over the East. Only four teams in the East are over .500 compared to eight in the West. With the exception of Indiana and Miami, there has been no competition when teams from the two sides have gone head-to-head. So, it’s time to take a look at the teams in the West. While the West has dominated over the East, there are some teams have overall have done really well and some that haven’t.

His partner in crime on offense, Russell Westbrook, was having one of his best NBA seasons until he suffered another injury, but he will be back this season.

San Antonio doesn’t allow opponents to find an offensive groove and continues to rank among the best in scoring defense. Most didn’t think San Antonio would compete with Miami last season, but this team of veterans doesn’t like to lose. They will always be around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Portland Trailblazers, A+</p>\n<p>One of the biggest surprises in the NBA this season has been Portland. A team that was at one point topping the West, the Blazers are the top scoring team in the NBA, averaging 108.7 points per game. The scoring starts with LaMarcus Aldridge, who is averaging an incredible 23.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. Complementing Aldridge’s inside game is point guard Damian Lillard, who adds 21.3 points and 5.8 assists per game. Combined with Wesley Matthews on the perimeter, all-around player Nicolas Batum, and Robin Lopez, who is exceeding expectations, Portland finally has a team that is coming together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Clippers, B</p>\n<p>The Clippers are right where they’re supposed to be, atop the Pacific Division. While the defense needs to improve, Chris Paul continues to show why he’s the best point guard in the NBA, averaging 19.6 points and a league-leading 11.2 assists per game. However, Paul is now out for three to five weeks with a shoulder injury and without its glue, L.A. must show it can still win games. Blake Griffin, who is currently averaging a team-high 22 points per game, will be critical. L.A. has plenty of role players on this team, so if they can play well, the Clippers should be able to manage until Paul’s return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Rockets, B</p>\n<p>Houston has dealt with inconsistency this season, losing to bad teams like Utah and Sacramento. Yet, the Rockets could be a great team going further into the season. Of course, the Rockets should be winning games with two of the best players in the game. James Harden is having another fantastic year, having his way with opponents’ defense, averaging 24.4 points per game. In the middle, Dwight Howard has returned to more of the dominant center fans know. Howard is giving the Rockets 17.8 points, 12.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. Along with Chandler Parsons and Jeremy Lin this is a team with plenty of firepower.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Golden State Warriors, B+</p>\n<p>The Warriors aren’t atop the Western Conference right now, but they’re always dangerous and have won eight straight games. They’ve dealt with small injuries along the way to Stephan Curry and Andre Iguodala, but scoring will never be a problem on this team, which features the most dangerous backcourt in the game right now. Curry is averaging 23.3 points per game while Klay Thompson is tallying 19.3 points per contest. David Lee has stepped up too, giving the Warriors 18.9 points per game. Defensively, Golden State has Iguodala and Andrew Bogut to keep opponents in check, so if healthy, they could go far this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Phoenix Suns, A</p>\n<p>Nobody thought Phoenix would be a playoff team. Most, including myself, thought the Suns would be a cellar dweller in the West. We were all wrong. Currently in the seventh seed, Phoenix is in the top 10 in the NBA in scoring, putting up 103.7 points per game. The reason for that can be found in Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. Bledsoe, the understudy of Chris Paul last season, has spread his wings, averaging 18.0 points and 5.8 assists. Dragic is averaging slightly better numbers, tallying 18.8 points and 5.9 assists. The pair of guards has made Phoenix a playoff team and a huge surprise this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dallas Mavericks, B</p>\n<p>When your team has Dirk Nowitzki, you always have a good chance of making the playoffs. The veteran forward is not showing signs of age by any means, putting up 21.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. He’s shooting 48.8 percent from the field, 40.8 percent from behind the arc and 92.0 percent from the free throw line. With Monta Ellis also making a big impact, averaging 20.2 points per game, there isn’t one player defenses can focus on. Defense might not be this team’s strength, but Nowitzki is a veteran player, making Dallas a team nobody can overlook.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Timberwolves, B-</p>\n<p>Kevin Love has been a monster on the court this year. Averaging 26.4 points (second-best in the NBA) and 13.5 rebounds per game, Love has been consistent, putting numbers on the board night in and night out. Kevin Martin and Nikola Pekovic also keep the defense busy, tallying 19.8 and 18.0 points per game, respectively. So the offense is strong in Minnesota. The problem keeping the T-Wolves out of the playoff picture? Defense. The team gives up 102.9 points per game, fourth-highest in the NBA. Yet, the Timberwolves are currently just one spot out of the playoffs, so this is a team not to give up on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Denver Nuggets, C+</p>\n<p>There’s one name to know in Denver: Ty Lawson. With Andre Iguodala gone, Lawson knows this is officially his team, and has put up the numbers to prove it, averaging 17.7 points and 8.1 assists per game. His teammates have matched his energy and the team has plenty of threats from behind the arc. Nevertheless, I don’t see this as a team that makes the playoffs. They simply don’t play good enough defense to be a top-eight contender.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New Orleans Pelicans, B-</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has stepped up big for New Orleans this season. The power forward continues to spread the opponents’ defense, shooting 40.9 percent from three-point range. Overall, he’s averaging an impressive 19.8 points per game. The problem for the Pelicans is that last week, Anderson went down with a neck injury and is still undergoing tests in Boston. The Pelicans do have Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans, all of which are capable of putting up big numbers, but without Anderson, this team will struggle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Memphis Grizzlies, C-</p>\n<p>It seems like the Grizzlies have always been known for their defense. And they still are, holding opponents to 97.5 points per game. Defense will win a lot of ball games, but to win, you also have to be able to score points. Mike Conley has found his stride on the offensive end, giving the Grizzlies a solid 17.3 points per game. Zach Randolph has also done his job for Memphis this season, leading the team with 17.1 points per game. Yet, the Grizzlies are still on the bottom end of the NBA in scoring. This may change when Marc Gasol returns, but the Grizzlies need to find an answer now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Lakers, B+</p>\n<p>The Lakers have to be wondering how they could receive so much bad luck in one season. Many teams have suffered injuries, but none as many as L.A. First, superstar Kobe Bryant returned from his torn Achilles tendon. Six games later, he injured his knee and will be out for extended time. Steve Nash has also only played in six games. He is one of a handful of point guards the Lakers have gone through. L.A. has gone deep into its D-League team with the only recognizable name left on the Lakers being Pau Gasol. With so much uncertainty and so many roster changes, Head Coach Mike D’Antoni requires a lot of credit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sacramento Kings, D</p>\n<p>In a rebuilding year, star DeMarcus Cousins has proved himself a premier center in the NBA, averaging 23.2 points and 11.4 rebounds, but Cousins still has a lot of maturing to do as he currently leads the league in technicals. Isaiah Thomas has also stepped up, adding 19.3 points and 6.2 assists per contest. The recently acquired Rudy Gay has been great thus far, putting up 19.5 points per game. But offense isn’t the problem. Despite Head Coach Michael Malone preaching defense, Sacramento still gives up 104.5 points to its opponent, second-worst in the NBA. The formula for improvement is pretty simple: play defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Utah Jazz, D+</p>\n<p>Compared to most NBA teams, Utah doesn’t have much talent, lacking a huge NBA star. Therefore, the team wasn’t expected to win big. Nevertheless, with the worst record in the West, it’s not possible to give this team a passing grade. In what was supposed to be a developmental year for the Jazz, Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors have been decent for the Jazz, averaging 16.5 and 13.5 points per game, respectively, but the Jazz need more from Trey Burke. The highly-anticipated rookie that slipped to the ninth pick in the draft has struggled with consistency despite averaging 13.3 points and 5.2 assists. Right now, the Jazz would have a good shot in the lottery, which looks to have several franchise-changing players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53394\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53394\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/","id":3246,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[3245,3244,3243],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One NBA Star on His Way Back, Another Out for the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Recovering Kobe Bryant Inks an Extension While Rose Goes Down Again After Just 11 Games","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Two huge stories broke yesterday that will dramatically alter the landscape of the NBA for at least the next two years.</p>\n<p>First, tragic news from Chicago validated Bulls fans’ worst nightmare: After missing all of the 2012-13 season with a torn ACL in his left knee, Derrick Rose’s comeback campaign was abruptly ended with news that he will miss all of 2013-14 with a torn meniscus in his right knee.</p>\n<p>Across the country, Laker fans got the first bit of good news on Kobe Bryant since he returned to practice.

A torn Achilles tendon can be a career-ender, especially for veterans like the 35-year-old Bryant.</p>\n<p>However, if there is any player that can do it, I’d bet my money on Kobe Bean Bryant. The man’s competitive drive and dedication to improvement is unmatched by any contemporary athlete not named Michael Jordan. He has played through broken fingers, tweaked wrists and ravaged knees. An injury to his foot is just the latest challenge to overcome, and Kobe has shown for years and years that he doesn’t mind taking some physical punishment.</p>\n<p>However, the basketball gods can be cruel. As an old man continues to defy the odds and return to prominence, a young man with all the talent in the world has his potential taken away with a simple buckle of his knee.</p>\n<p>Rose has the potential to be every bit as good of a player as Kobe is, if not better. Rose was better than Kobe at a younger age, and has a work ethic that compares. Unfortunately, NBA fans will have to wait another year to see if Rose is the same player he once was, and the question must be asked if we will ever get the pleasure of watching him dominate the game offensively again.</p>\n<p>If there is a silver lining for Bulls fans, it’s that the meniscus was salvaged and repaired via surgery, and Rose is expected to be able to make a full recovery. The results of the surgery show that the injury is not as severe as the torn ACL was, and Rose managed to come back from that in the best physical shape of his life. Rose never quite found his rhythm this year, but the athleticism was back.</p>\n<p>There is still hope that Rose can return next season and become the MVP-caliber player that he was before the injuries. He was a 22-year-old MVP and is only 25 today, still yet to reach his prime years. But to the average observer, playing like an MVP after two missed seasons in a row due to knee injuries is a hard scenario to imagine. If the Bulls’ locker room atmosphere is any indication, we could have just witnessed a Hall of Fame-worthy career deteriorate before our very eyes.</p>\n<p>But keep in mind, the last player to win an MVP award besides LeBron James was Derrick Rose. To doubt his return to greatness is to tempt the competitive spirit of a man who was seemingly born to be a champion. Rose has elite, athletic DNA, and his triumphant return would be a testament to his greatness and to the achievements of modern sports medicine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/","id":3242,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3241,3240,3239],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Cinderella Story","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776639-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776639-O.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's historic run has catapulted the Gauchos from mediocrity to the top of the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>What makes sports so fun to follow? As fans, we try to write the scripts of our favorite sports even before any games are played. We always think we know what’s coming — which team will end up in first place and which one is doomed to a season of insignificance — yet we keep watching. We do this because we know that on any given day, an underdog can win a game that they weren’t supposed to. The script is constantly being flipped, and we are reminded that every statistic we see on paper is thrown out the window the second the two teams step onto the playing field. We don’t want to miss out on the teams making those amazing runs, those improbable upsets that no one could have seen coming. This season, the UCSB women’s volleyball team just happens to be one of those teams.</p>\n<p>After the Big West Preseason Coaches Poll predicted the Gauchos to finish in sixth place out of nine in the conference, expectations weren’t exactly sky high. New coaches, new players and a conference dominated by Hawaii, the No. 11 ranked team in the nation — not the ideal formula for a season with championship aspirations. For whatever reason, though, this team of scrappy Gauchos has done the improbable this season. They are currently second in the Big West at 10-2, trailing only the 12-2 Matadors of Cal State Northridge. With just four matches left and a tiebreaker over Northridge, UCSB has its destiny in its own hands; win out, and they’re the champs. But how did this happen?</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons I took the program is because I knew we could have success, challenge for Big West championships and make the NCAA’s,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “However, back in February when I took over, I did not think that we would be challenging [this season], and that’s just a testament and credit to the team.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Twelve games into the year, the Gauchos didn’t look like the team that they knew they could be. They had played well at times, but with a 5-7 preseason record, that sixth place prediction wasn’t looking too far off. Despite the sub-.500 record heading into their first conference match, though, the team knew it was capable of much more.</p>\n<p>“We had a really tough preseason, and there were some games that we should have won,” freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt said. “But I think the preseason showed us what we could do. Taking games off top-teams gave us a lot of confidence, we just kept working super hard in practice and everything sort of came together.”</p>\n<p>In their Big West opener at home against Long Beach State, the Gauchos were seemingly at a disadvantage because of an injury to senior outside hitter and co-captain Leah Sully’s hitting arm the week before. As a result, UCSB stumbled to a disappointing 3-2 loss, but the injury would prove to be a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>“That was the first match we moved Leah to libero and so we had a brand-new lineup and only a day or two to practice with it,” Lantagne Welch said. “We really got into a rhythm after that and were able to really produce. People were really comfortable in their roles and really started to excel from that point on.”</p>\n<p>With Sully now playing libero, other positions began to open up for the younger players on the team. Sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau’s production skyrocketed thanks to the absence of Sully on the outside, and Spindt established herself as a nightly threat for a double-double. The Gauchos also received consistent contributions from freshmen middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg, who have remarkably risen to first and fourth, respectively, in blocks per set in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for any freshman to come into a starting role, there’s a lot of adjustments to be made,” Sully said. “But they did a really great job at taking on their roles and when they play well other people play well, so that helps the team a lot.”</p>\n<p>With the role players in place, Sully continuing to anchor the middle at libero, and senior opposite Katey Thompson performing at a high level as the team’s top hitter, the Gauchos were ready to make a run, and they did just that.</p>\n<p>Following the loss to Long Beach State, UCSB took down UC Irvine in straight sets and a hot Cal Poly team, 3-1. Next up was the most difficult road test of the season: Hawaii. The Rainbow Wahine had risen to No. 3 in the nation at the time and had been undefeated in the Big West since they entered it last season, but the girls from Santa Barbara came in ready for a fight. After five grueling sets, the Gauchos came away with one of their biggest and most exciting wins in the team’s recent history, reminding everyone, including themselves, that anything was possible.</p>\n<p>“I think the team really believed that we could play with anybody,” Lantagne Welch said. “The combination of the older players believing in the new players, and everyone just being ready to go after it was a big point in that victory.”</p>\n<p>From then, things became almost too easy. UCSB defeated the Big West’s top team for the second straight week in Cal State Northridge, 3-0. The next day, it showed its resilience in a comeback victory over a tough UC Davis squad. In the Gauchos’ next three road matches, they failed to drop even one set, sweeping UC Riverside, Cal State Fullerton and Cal Poly as they prepared for the season’s final stretch of matches.</p>\n<p>“One of the best things is we had such balance,” Lantagne Welch said. “One match it would be a Katey Thompson, another match it would be an Ali Spindt, then it was Ali Barbeau and Leah Sully’s passing and defense. There isn’t one particular player, and I think that’s the reflection of our success because there have been so many contributions.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s historic winning-streak of eight straight matches, its longest since 2005, came to a close in a tough loss to Hawaii a couple of weeks ago, but the Gauchos have since bounced back with wins over Davis and first-place Northridge. The Gauchos haven’t made it to the NCAA tournament since 2009, and they haven’t won the conference since 2004, but for whatever reason, this is the year that it might happen.</p>\n<p>With all the unexpected ups and downs a season has to offer, it is difficult to predict how any team’s year will go. Sometimes, like in the case of the 2013 UCSB women’s volleyball team, everything just comes together the right way at the right time. Now, just four more wins is all it will take to complete what has been a storybook season. Four more wins, and these underdog Gauchos are Big West champs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 20, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/","id":3241,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3240,3239,3238],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Carolina Cooking Something Special","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11192013-CamNewton-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11192013-CamNewton-1.jpg?resize=650%2C352&ssl=1","description":"Carolina is the hottest team in the NFL with a six-game winning streak.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s always fun to see the maturation of a player with the tools to become a star finally perform on the field in personal accomplishments, but more importantly in team victories. One such example this season is quarterback Cam Newton and the emergence of the Carolina Panthers as a postseason contender. The Panthers currently own the third-best record in the National Football Conference (NFC) and sit only one game behind the New Orleans Saints in the NFC South. Carolina has won six straight games, the previous two over perennial Super Bowl contenders in the San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots and looks like a team with a legitimate chance to make a postseason run.</p>\n<p>Before delving into why the Panthers have been so successful this season, I will address the controversial victory over the Patriots on Monday Night Football. In the final play of the game, linebacker Luke Kuechly wrapped his arms around Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski as Patriots quarterback Tom Brady’s last-second heave was intercepted by Panthers safety Robert Lester. The back judge threw a flag for pass interference before conferencing with the other officials. The referees then proceeded to pick up the flag, say there was no foul on the play and run off the field. There was no explanation offered to the Patriots and the game simply ended in a controversial non-call.</p>\n<p>First off, the officials should have explained waving off the penalty. Analysts seem split on whether this play warranted a flag, and I’m on the side saying Brady deserved an opportunity to give the Patriots a win with one final play from the one-yard line. Sure, maybe Gronkowski wouldn’t have been able to get back to the ball in time to stop the interception. But the play was too close to call to avoid such a blatantly clear penalty. It’s not as if the ball was 15 feet above Gronkowski’s head or twenty yards short. Gronk was close enough to the play that if he wasn’t held, it is reasonable enough to imagine a player of his magnitude at least tipping the ball in the air and extending the play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I think it should have been a penalty giving the Patriots one final play to win the game, but that was not the sole determiner in the game. The Panthers played extremely well against a talented New England squad and asserted themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the NFL this season with back-to-back quality wins over probable postseason squads.</p>\n<p>Newton has improved his play this season tremendously, and while his passing yardage totals are down from his first two seasons, his accuracy and decision-making skills are way up. Newton ranks ninth in the NFL in quarterback rating at 91.8 and finished Monday’s game 19-28 with 209 yards passing and three touchdowns. Add in an additional 62 yards on the ground and Newton really displayed just how dangerous he can be to opposing defenses.</p>\n<p>The former Heisman winner displays the big-play ability, both with his arm and legs, to make Carolina just dangerous enough to scrape by offensively. Carolina’s key offensively is Newton and the Panthers live or die depending on how Cam performs week to week.</p>\n<p>Carolina’s offense may not be elite, but the Panthers possess some formidable weapons in deep-threat receiver Steve Smith, a tough pass catching tight end in Greg Olsen and a trio of diversely skilled running backs in DeAngelo Williams, Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert. It’s certainly not the best or even one of the top ten offenses in the NFL, but with such a dominant defense, the Panthers don’t need their offense to carry them every game. Newton just has to limit mistakes and make enough big plays to ensure the Panthers put points on the board and keep it out of the other team’s hands.</p>\n<p>Where the Panthers’ true strength lies is in its defense. Carolina is allowing a mere 13.5 points per game through 10 games this season, a mark that if it holds up over the remainder of the season would rank as the lowest point per game total allowed by a defense in the NFL since the 2006 Baltimore Ravens. Pretty impressive for a Panthers squad that started the season 1-3 including losses in which they allowed over 20 points at the hands of Buffalo and Arizona.</p>\n<p>Kuechly and fellow linebacker Thomas Davis are racking up the tackles in the middle of the field, ranking ninth and 13th in the league in tackles, respectively. The duo has combined for a total of 170 tackles. On the defensive line, defensive end Charles Johnson ranks ninth in the NFL with 8.5 sacks this season, while defensive tackles Dwan Edwards and Star Lotulelei have helped the Panthers stuff the run. Carolina ranks third in the league allowing 84.5 rushing yards per game.</p>\n<p>The defensive secondary has been solid all season as well, aided by the frequent pressure the front seven puts on quarterbacks. Carolina ranks fifth in the league in passing yards allowed and is second in forced turnovers with 23 this season. The Panthers rank third in the league in turnover differential, a major component to the team’s success this season.</p>\n<p>With a roster consisting of many young and developing stars, the Panthers’ brightest days are certainly ahead of them. Already possessing a dominant defense and a still growing and versatile franchise quarterback, Carolina is in position to be a NFC South contender over the next several years. NFL teams should be afraid if the Panthers continue to perform as they have during this six-game winning streak, especially if they can continue defeating elite teams like the 49ers and Patriots.</p>\n<p>Carolina’s ceiling this season depends largely on the two remaining games against New Orleans in weeks 14 and 16. If the Panthers can manage to win one of these matchups, or even miraculously pull off a sweep, a NFC South title and possibly even a first-round bye would not be out of the question. Aside from these two games, the Panthers’ remaining schedule is less than daunting with matchups against the inconsistent Dolphins and Jets, and games against the lowly Buccaneers and Falcons. An 11-win campaign, as unlikely as it would have seemed at the beginning of the year, looks like a definite possibility for Carolina this season.</p>\n<p>Flaws remain for the Panthers however, specifically in the running game, where they have had only one 100-yard rusher in a game all season. As a young squad, it is still early to tell whether Carolina can maintain its current pace and make the postseason in a competitive NFC. This is after all a team that lost earlier in the season to a mediocre Buffalo team.</p>\n<p>Again, if Carolina continues its spectacular defensive play and Newton can avoid costly turnovers and make big drive-extending plays when necessary, Carolina could emerge as the surprise team of the season. If the next six weeks of the season are in any way like the previous six for the Panthers, the NFL better watch out for Carolina come the postseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 20, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Irene Kuo of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/","id":3244,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3243,3242,3241],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dolphins’ Locker Room Antics Show Flaw in NFL","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A look at the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the NFL you are supposed to channel all your aggression and violence toward your opponent — not your teammate.

Martin hired a lawyer who released Incognito’s messages to Martin, a move that has stirred up controversy in a league that prides itself in keeping player issues behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>Say what you will about football being a “man’s sport” or the fact that Martin should have handled this situation inside of the locker room. When someone work in an environment where racial slurs and threats are part of the norm, something needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>What is even more shocking is that teammates have come in support of Incognito, dismissing his threats and racial epithets.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has come to the defense of Martin and rightly so, because whatever locker room culture the Dolphins have created over the past years leading up to this situation is not normal — far from it.</p>\n<p>If the players of the Dolphins actually support Incognito and his use of racial slurs, then that says something about the nature of the Dolphins locker room and what exactly is allowed to go on in there. Not only that, it shows the lack of leadership on the team. If football really is a man’s game, it’s time for the Dolphins players to start acting like men.</p>\n<p>Ross has formed his own task force of former Miami Dolphin greats such as Don Shula, Dan Marino, Jason Taylor and highly respected NFL figures, such as former head coach Tony Dungy. Their job will be to analyze exactly what was going on in the Miami locker room and most importantly, establish a code of conduct for the team, because clearly the team is in need.</p>\n<p>For Ross, this is a step in the right direction not just for his franchise, but for all of the NFL, because if this is happening in one locker room it is more than likely happening to more teams.</p>\n<p>Expect NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to come down hard on the Miami Dolphins and that includes excessive fines and suspensions. Dolphins Head Coach Joe Philbin will likely be out of a job for being oblivious to what was going on in his own locker room and General Manager Jeff Ireland in all likelihood will also be out of a job.</p>\n<p>In his first sit-down interview, Incognito insisted he is not racist and did not apologize for his actions. Incognito has also said that Martin sent him messages with the same type of language. This is a poor defense to hide behind extreme behavior encouraged by teammates and does not justify his actions.</p>\n<p>The big picture is this — any type of bullying inside the locker room has no place in the NFL or any other sport for that matter. It is up to the Miami Dolphins organization and the NFL to correct this situation and prevent it from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>Martin is now currently in Los Angeles receiving counseling and a report came out yesterday that Martin wants to play professional football again, just not this year and of course not with the Dolphins. Though Martin is just 24 and a former second-round draft pick, the question to ask is which team will bring him in considering the potential risk he can bring to a team after seeing what the Miami Dolphins are now under.</p>\n<p>Some players will definitely be against the idea and many general managers would not like the distraction from the media Martin would bring. Until then, you can only hope that the league will be there for Martin because that was clearly missing in Miami.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/","id":3243,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3242,3241,3240],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jonathan Martin Wrong to Ditch His Teammates","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A look at the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Let me start by saying that the Miami Dolphins’ guard Richie Incognito should feel horribly guilty in his role regarding the pending-resignation of fellow offensive lineman and teammate Jonathan Martin. Evidence has come forward regarding Incognito’s harassment toward Martin, proving that the nine-year NFL veteran made vulgar, racist threats to the second-year pro. I don’t care what your line of work is; nobody deserves to put themselves in a hostile work environment where they feel their safety is in jeopardy. Racism and bigotry go beyond the boundaries of safety and are as open to condemnation as physical abuse and harassment. And of course nobody should be forced by others to attend “team meetings” at strip clubs and pay tabs that are not their own.</p>\n<p>But I propose that we put the most stock into the testimony of the teammates, and consider NFL locker room culture for what it is. Many of the most respected veterans on the Dolphins side with Incognito and want his suspension lifted. According to NFL Hall-of-Famer Cris Carter’s conversations with wide receiver Mike Wallace and center Mike Pouncey, Incognito is “loved” and “respected” by all his teammates. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill described Incognito as a “big brother” to Martin and “the best friend he had on the team.”</p>\n<p>And then one day, Martin cracked. After a lunchroom prank by Incognito, completely commonplace between teammates throughout the history of the NFL, Martin decided he no longer wanted to be the scrub and that he had enough. However, not once did he talk to Incognito or anyone else to express his frustration. He surprised his teammates, coaches and the league by quitting the team right before a big game and filing a formal complaint with the league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>By doing this, Martin committed multiple cardinal sins against his teammates, the ones who stand the most to lose from locker room dysfunction. He went to the media and exposed information regarding team chemistry without consulting any teammates. And HE QUIT AN NFL TEAM MID-SEASON, just because he got his feelings hurt. Abandoning your teammates for any reason within your control is far worse to a teammate than some expletive language and idle, empty threats. This behavior is despicable when acted out with sincerity and real malicious intent. But in the NFL, this kind of behavior between teammates is meant to build the mental toughness that is required in such a violent, crude, high-pressure and high-stakes job.</p>\n<p>An NFL field is a violent place by nature. Imagine 11 300-pound men trying their best to knock you out and injure you continuously for three hours. Then imagine every vile slur regarding you and your mother being spit at you while you try to counter this force. There is a reason that NFL rhetoric most resembles that of military personnel.</p>\n<p>I’m not proposing that Incognito had the right to do what he did. I’m proposing that Martin, as a fully-grown adult and an NFL player, should have a thick enough skin to stand up to Incognito and fight his battles himself. Martin is actually 10 pounds heavier than Incognito, so he has nothing to worry about as far as physical intimidation. Martin is also an educated man, a Stanford graduate who should be able to understand the context and disregard what would be considered bullying in any other line of work.</p>\n<p>Martin’s reaction could have been reflective of deeper-seeded issues. He has struggled on the field this year and lost his job as starting left tackle. If Martin has personal demons to battle before he is ready to play football again, he should take the time to sort those out and help himself get healthy. But he did not need to throw his best friend and teammate under the bus. Instead of being the bigger man and dealing with Incognito in a mature, adult manner, Martin left his team in shambles and now faces an uphill battle towards acceptance in any NFL locker room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus</p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of </em>The Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/","id":3240,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3239,3238,3237],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2013 MLB Season Recap: The Best of the Best","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cabrera-by-Amy-Chase.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cabrera-by-Amy-Chase.png?resize=504%2C504&ssl=1","description":"The best players in each position for the 2013 MLB Season","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The MLB season has come and gone.

A 16-9 record, 232 strikeouts in 236 innings, a 1.83 ERA, a 0.92 WHIP and a trip to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) should be more than enough good work to walk away with the NL Cy Young Award. The Phillies’ Cliff Lee and the Marlins’ Jose Fernandez had excellent seasons as well, but Kershaw is far and away the best pitcher in baseball, and looks to continue his reign for the next decade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Relief Pitcher: Craig Kimbrel, Atlanta Braves</p>\n<p>Kimbrel was unhittable as the closer for the Braves this year, posting a 3.3 Wins Above Replacement mark and a 1.21 ERA while registering 50 saves. In an age where Mariano Rivera is retired and elite relievers are considered a rare luxury, Kimbrel’s 101 mph fastball earns him the title of Franchise Closer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First Baseman: Chris Davis, Baltimore Orioles</p>\n<p>Baltimore faded down the stretch, but there was a time when it looked like the O’s were going to come away with the AL East crown. Davis’ historic home run streak was the heart and soul of Baltimore’s offense through the All-Star break, at which point he had 37 home runs. Davis finished the year with a .286/53/138/.370 line, enough for MVP consideration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second Baseman: Dustin Pedroia, Boston Red Sox</p>\n<p>Dusty might not have the power numbers of rival second baseman Robinson Cano from the Yankees, but the leadership, clutch hitting, defense and intangibles that Pedroia brings to the Red Sox vault him into this spot. He is the most valuable player on the World Series Champions and would have won the award by default if not for David Ortiz having the greatest offensive series of all time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shortstop: Andrelton Simmons, Atlanta Braves</p>\n<p>You might be surprised to see a player with a .248 batting average make this list. But even if Troy Tulowitzki and Hanley Ramirez had been healthy all season, I think the 24-year old rookie phenom still would have won this award. Simmons came up with some big hits this season and provides a little pop to the Braves offense, but his true value is as the best defensive player in baseball playing the most important defensive position. To put it in numbers, Simmons won 5.4 extra games for his team compared to the average player, just as a result of his defense. The next closest shortstop put up a 2.2 DWAR. To put it rhetorically, Simmons is the next Ozzie Smith.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Third Baseman: Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers</p>\n<p>Stat nuts and Bay-Area folk might be disappointed to find Miggy here over A’s third baseman Josh Donaldson, who was fourth in baseball with an 8.0 WAR. But Cabrera’s deficiencies on defense are overshadowed by his impact on offense as the most dominant hitter of our generation. A .348/44/137/.442 line speaks for itself when this MVP caliber season is merely average considering the player’s recent history.</p>\n<p>Outfield: Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels</p>\n<p>Trout got off to a slow start, but quietly bounced back to be the best player in baseball yet again (9.2 WAR). If not for the Josh Hamilton/Albert Pujols disaster, the Angels would have been in contention and trout would have taken home the MVP hardware he should have won last year. Instead, he will get snubbed for the second year in a row. Good thing the kid is only 22 years old and has another 15 years to dominate baseball.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Outfield: Andrew McCutchen, Pittsburg Pirates</p>\n<p>The Pirates never would have ended their playoff drought without the incredible performance of their superstar centerfielder. McCutchen is the epitome of a five tool player, the NL’s equivalent to Trout. As long as he’s in town, the Pirates should be able to show that they were no fluke.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Outfield: Carlos Gomez, Milwaukee Brewers</p>\n<p>Gomez enjoyed a renaissance 2013 season, which established him as the star many thought he would be years ago. Maybe it’s the water, maybe it’s the local beer, but whatever it is, Gomez needs to keep drinking it. A career sub-.250 hitter, the 27 year-old broke out not only in average (.284), but in power (24 homeruns) and defense (career high 4.6 DWAR). The 8.4 WAR he brought his team are as many as every previous season combined. The career journeyman should have a home in Miller Park for many years to come.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52826\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52826\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/","id":3239,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3238,3237,3236],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Despite Offensive Struggles, Patriots Showed Potential vs. Steelers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Patriots-sports.jpeg?resize=329%2C153&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Patriots-sports.jpeg?resize=329%2C153&ssl=1","description":"NFL column","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When examining the New England Patriots’ 7-2 record, most would assume they have been the same old offensive juggernauts they have always been.</p>\n<p>However, before this week’s 55-31 trouncing of the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England’s offense, and Tom Brady specifically, struggled to put points on the board.

Brady topped 300 yards once in the first eight games and never threw more than two touchdown passes in any one game.</p>\n<p>With Gronk and Amendola fully healthy, Brady no longer had to rely on the likes of Julian Edelman, undrafted rookie Kenbrell Thompkins and Aaron Dobson to be the primary pass catchers. Dobson has proven to be a valuable rookie receiver and will blossom now that defenders’ focus will shift to Amendola and Gronkowski.</p>\n<p>Amendola is one of the top slot receivers in the game and his shiftiness and ability to create space gives Brady plenty of options in the middle of the field. Gronkowski is as deadly of a weapon deep and in the middle as anyone in the game and Dobson has showed signs as a dangerous deep threat with breakaway speed.</p>\n<p>Add in a versatile Edelman and a balanced running attack with weapons such as Stevan Ridley and the injured, but expected to return soon, Shane Vereen, and the Patriots maintain a balanced and dangerous offensive attack. Defenses will certainly have trouble slowing down the many options Brady has at his disposal.</p>\n<p>Some may question how much merit can be put into New England’s offensive performance against a lowly Steelers squad that has struggled mightily this season. Sure, New England’s 610-yard performance (the third-most in franchise history) may have been aided by Pittsburgh’s defensive ineptitude. But give credit where it is due: The Patriots were absolutely dominant on Sunday, and any offense that features Tom Brady throwing to such formidable targets as Gronkowski and Amendola can’t be as bad as what the Patriots put on the field early this season.</p>\n<p>Despite their offensive struggles, New England has still found a way to win, entering the halfway point of the season atop the AFC East standings and holding the fourth-best record in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Barring further injury to offensive personnel, the Patriots are once again positioned for a run at Super Bowl title. Other teams such as Kansas City and Denver may have performed better up to this point in the season, but New England presents as dangerous an option as any to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. The Patriots are on a short list of teams that can realistically challenge the Broncos as the expected AFC Super Bowl representative.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/","id":3232,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3231,3230,3229],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Projected Top Five Picks of the  NFL Draft: Marcus Mariota Goes First to the Jaguars","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Marcus Mariota Goes First to the Jaguars","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Jacksonville Jaguars — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>Jacksonville is perhaps the worst team in the NFL since the 2008 Lions finished the season 0-16. The Jaguars are finishing this season with two wins at most and should secure the first pick. While Jadeveon Clowney is the highest-rated player on most experts’ draft boards, the Jaguars need a franchise quarterback and cannot afford to pass up the opportunity. Blaine Gabbert simply isn’t getting the job done. Mariota is an interesting dual-threat quarterback with unlimited potential, as he is only a redshirt sophomore at Oregon. If he keeps improving as a passer this year and helps the Ducks to a BCS title, he could very well be the first pick.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Jadeveon Clowney, DE, South Carolina</p>\n<p>Tampa Bay hasn’t been much better than Jacksonville this year and has yet to win a game. A new quarterback doesn’t seem to be an option here as the Buccaneers have faith in rookie Mike Glennon to develop into a formidable option. That’s when the Buccaneers go for the highest-rated player rather than the area of most need. Clowney is a once-in-a-decade-type athlete with the size and power of a defensive end and the speed of a safety. Tampa Bay would be foolish to pass up on Clowney and could pair him up on the defensive line with Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. That would certainly improve the Buccaneers’ defense and give them a multitude of weapons similar to their glory days in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Last season, Minnesota rode Adrian Peterson’s record season to the playoffs, but with A.P. slowed down this year, the Vikings are once again floundering The Vikings trio of quarterbacks in Christian Ponder, Josh Freeman and Matt Cassel don’t seem like likely long-term options in Minnesota, although Freeman certainly has an opportunity to change the front office’s mind once he returns from injury. Bridgewater entered this season as the top-rated quarterback, but Mariota simply has more upside and has performed better to date. The Louisville signal caller has the poise in the pocket to balance a Minnesota attack so heavily reliant on the run.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Louis Rams — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Just when the Rams look like they’ve turned a corner, starting quarterback Sam Bradford tears his ACL in a season-ending injury. With Kellen Clemens as the current starter for St. Louis, there does not appear to be much hope in the Gateway City this season. Bradford will be back and fully healthy next season with a young array of offensive weapons. Defensively, St. Louis is set at the most important positions, so the Rams will look to upgrade their offensive line with Matthews replacing the oft-injured Rodger Saffold at right tackle. Matthews has done a superb job of protecting Johnny Football’s blind side the last two seasons at A&amp;M and should have no trouble sliding over to the right side of the line and protecting Bradford this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Steelers — Anthony Barr, OLB, UCLA</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh has been the biggest disappointment in the NFL this season. Defense has always been the key to success for the Steelers, and adding an elite pass rusher who can wreak havoc in Pittsburgh’s 3-4 system looks to be the smartest move. Add Barr to a core of linebackers including LaMarr Woodley, Jarvis Jones and Lawrence Timmons and Pittsburgh might feature the best and most athletic group of linebackers in the game. Barr has been a defensive revelation for UCLA after switching over from playing fullback during his first two seasons. He has the size and speed to slide over to defensive end if need be and does a solid job not only rushing the quarterback, but also roaming the field, racking up tackles and even dropping back into coverage. This guy is a freak of an athlete and the best defensive prospect other than Clowney.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52662\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52662\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/","id":3238,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3237,3236,3235],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Projected Top Five Picks of the  NFL Draft: Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Jacksonville Jaguars — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Jacksonville’s woes don’t figure to end at any point.

Instead, Freeman is now a benchwarmer for the Minnesota Vikings, leaving Vincent Jackson and Mike Glennon as the only notable players on a porous offense. The defense is actually alright, especially against the run. Clowney is far and away the best player in the draft, and the only way he doesn’t go to the Bucs here is via a trade. An elite pass rusher is the only missing ingredient from this defense and would be exactly what Tampa Bay needs to get back to their smash-mouth, physical style that took them to the Super Bowl over a decade ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>The signing of Josh Freeman signifies the end of the Christian Ponder era in Minnesota. However, after Freeman’s cringe-worthy debut for the Purple People Eaters, it is clear that their franchise QB is not on this roster at the moment. Enter Mariota. The redshirt sophomore phenom is skyrocketing up draft boards and is now being ranked even higher than Teddy Bridgewater. Mariota’s 95.5 Total Quarterback Rating is tops in the nation and better than all of the last four Heisman-winning quarterbacks. He has elite athleticism comparable to Robert Griffin III, and this season he has added the ability to throw deep passes down the sidelines. Bridgewater is considered more of a sure thing, and thus more likely to go number one. But Mariota has the highest upside of any offensive player in the draft and has a chance to leapfrog into the number one spot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Giants — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Through the first six games of the season, New York was historically awful, even giving the Jaguars a run for their money as worst in the league. They seemed to have turned it around a bit, although their only two wins have come against a demoralized Vikings team and a beat-up Eagles team. Their point differential and unbalanced team composition are the makeup for a terrible team, and they need to add some great role players to contend next year. A franchise left tackle like Matthews would help protect Eli Manning, restore the capacity to utilize Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks and rejuvenate the worst running game in football. A playmaker on defense is also a possibility, but I expect NY to look to improve an offense that earlier in the season got shut out by the Carolina Panthers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Texans — Sammy Watkins, WR, Clemson</p>\n<p>This would be the pick if the season ended today and no trades were made, but I don’t expect it to actually shape up this way. Houston needs a quarterback, but with Mariota and Bridgewater off the board, there is no player worthy of a top five pick. I expect Houston to trade down and go after someone like Brett Hundley, Tajh Boyd or Johnny Manziel. However, all this considered, Watkins would be a solid pick for the Texans here. An explosive playmaker on offense, Watkins has the potential of an elite number one to take the place of the slowing Andre Johnson. He does incredible things after the catch and is showing the technical ability to be a reliable, go-to threat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/","id":2086,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2085,2084,2083],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Can’t Miss Predictions Entering the NBA Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NBALogo.svg_.png?resize=197%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NBALogo.svg_.png?resize=197%2C447&ssl=1","description":"LeBron and co. are ready for a three-peat.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I must be honest. As a Los Angeles Lakers diehard fan, I don’t remember a year where my enthusiasm for the impending NBA season was so low.

LeBron has firmly established his place as one of the greatest NBA players of all time, and he’s still in his prime at the age of 28. The only wings you could throw in the same sentence would be Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. And even that’s an unfair comparison to James since he plays all five positions as well as anyone in history, including Magic Johnson. Nothing short of a devastating injury or Kevin Durant scoring 50 points a game will knock the King off his throne.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>The Los Angeles Lakers will miss the playoffs for the third time since 1976</strong></p>\n<p>This pains me to write, but even the most loyal Lakers fans see the writing on the wall. Last season’s seventh place finish was a complete disaster, and the team has been blown up with no significant improvements in the offseason. Dwight Howard abandoned ship after failing to live up to the hype while recovering from surgery. Now the hopes of the Lakers rest in the hands of Canada’s founding father Steve Nash, a pair of seven-foot cavemen [age and facial hair considered] in Pau Gasol and Chris Kaman, and a trigger happy journeyman wing referred to as “Swaggy P.” Shooting guard Nick Young fills the void left by Kobe Bryant and figures to be the Lakers’ leading scorer as long as Kobe is rehabbing. Of course, Kobe is the toughest athlete in the nation and could surprise everyone with an early triumphant return, and Pau is aging gracefully as a still effective starter. But the stars are aligned for the team in red that plays at Staples Center this year.</p>\n<p><strong>The 76ers will “win” the “waste for Wiggins” race</strong></p>\n<p>With the balance of power in the NBA extremely top-heavy for the last decade, teams realize that being awful and throwing a season in the hopes of landing the top pick in the draft is more advisable than dwelling in mediocrity for years and years. Just ask the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors and Portland Trail Blazers, among others. The 76ers could be historically bad, with the Andrew Bynum experiment ending in failure and their best player Jrue Holiday being traded for a first round pick with a torn ACL. Nerlens Noel is out for the season, leaving Evan Turner as the only solid starter on the entire roster. Spencer Hawes has shown flashes of being a very productive player, but the team will still be awful even with those two playing their best basketball.</p>\n<p>We could see some great stories this season. The Cavaliers could return to contention, the Pacers will be better this year, and the return of Derrick Rose to the Bulls could give the Heat a run for their money. But at the top of the hierarchy, the song remains the same. Cheers to classic rock references.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/","id":2084,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2083,2082,2081],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Down But Never Out: Leah Sully Battles Back from Injury","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Leah Sully Battled Back From a Torn ACL","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There are a select few injuries in sports that every athlete can only hope they never have to experience.

The increasingly prevalent season-ending knee injury can happen to anyone at anytime, ending a promising season or even a career in a flash.</p>\n<p>Some players never come back from tearing their ACL.

She was third on the team with 223 kills and led the entire Big West with 52 service aces. In the only NCAA tournament appearance of her college career against St. Mary’s, she posted a then-career-high 20 digs.</p>\n<p>“Her first year she was a tremendous impact player,” Gregory said. “Her hitting was good, but that wasn’t the most important thing. She was a great all-around player. Her passing, defense and serving were what was really good.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the first match of her sophomore season, Leah came down with the injury that ended her year just as it began.</p>\n<p>“It was tough because I was excited to have a good season and it’s just a hard thing to cope with in the beginning,” Sully said. “Once I got over that initial hump though, I was just trying to work hard at rehab and push myself to get back as quick as I could.”</p>\n<p>Her coach, however, looked only at the positives that she believed would come from an injury of such magnitude.</p>\n<p>“As difficult as it is to go through an injury, there’s always a silver lining,” Gregory said. “She sat out a year and her hitting got better and better, and by the last year I coached she was the go-to hitter. She really developed her all-around game.”</p>\n<p>While most athletes fear that knee injuries will hinder their physical abilities in a more general sense, when it comes to a sport like volleyball, players and coaches are more concerned with one thing in particular: jumping. Sully made it a point to battle her way into peak physical form before the start of the next season and prove that that would not be an issue.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to improve my vertical,” Sully said. “That was the biggest thing, and I ended up gaining two inches when I came back to the team.”</p>\n<p>Since coming back from her injury, Sully has led the Gauchos in total kills, digs and aces, further solidifying her reputation as an all-around player. She has earned All-Big West First Team honors, she’s placed her name all over the UCSB record books, and she will surely hit many more statistical milestones before her time is done. Despite all of these accomplishments though, there are still a few goals that have continued to elude her.</p>\n<p>“Obviously I would like to go as far in NCAA as possible,” Sully said. “But a Big West title would be huge.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a difficult preseason this year, going 5-7, but they received some bad news before their first conference game of the season when an MRI showed that Sully had a sprained ligament in her elbow. As the team’s top outside hitter, it wasn’t a very good time for her to be forced to sit out games for the first time since her ACL tear.</p>\n<p>As a result, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch moved Sully to libero; a position where she could play without risking further injury, but also one which she had never before started at in college. Since that decision, UCSB has gone on a tremendous 5-1 run to start their Big West campaign, highlighted by an incredible road win over No. 9 Hawaii in which Sully had a game-high 22 digs.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of what position she’s playing, she’s trying to win at everything,” Sully’s teammate senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “There’s always this intensity and heart to play 100 percent, to just leave it all out there.”</p>\n<p>Thompson perhaps knows better than anybody what Sully went through while rehabilitating her ACL because she too was sidelined for the majority of the 2009 season with a knee injury.</p>\n<p>“After she came back, her mindset completely changed, and she was more driven than ever,” Thompson said. “Her mindset is just so aggressive, she wants to win so badly and she’ll do whatever it takes and play whatever position she’s assigned to.”</p>\n<p>During her time as a Gaucho, Sully has excelled in everything she’s been tasked with doing on the court. Since tearing her ACL, she became the team’s number one hitter, she has been a calming force on the defense whether she’s playing libero or any other position, and she’s become a true leader for her teammates both on and off the court. Not surprisingly, she can owe much of her success to the time she was forced to spend off the court.</p>\n<p>“That knee injury was really inspirational for me because I had never had a serious injury before,” Sully said. “Just always having that in the back of my mind, every day when I come into practice there’s times when I think about it and how I couldn’t play for so long. It really makes you want to practice every day as hard as you can.”</p>\n<p>The silver lining that Coach Gregory foresaw may just be the reason why Leah Sully has, and will continue to be one of the best women’s volleyball players that UCSB has ever been lucky to call a Gaucho.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52583\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52583\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/","id":3230,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3229,3228,3227],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":13,"route":"/categories/sports/columnsfeatures","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
