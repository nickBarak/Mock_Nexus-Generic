The last series, they had two games of more than eight hits each with a total of two runs combined, as oftentimes base runners were left stranded in scoring position.</p>\n<p>Against a team like Fullerton, whose pitching staff has a combined 2.55 ERA and is led by senior Kelsey Kessler’s (19-6) incredible 1.39 ERA, leaving runs on the table is not an option, as opportunities to score will be few and far between.</p>\n<p>Kessler earned her third consecutive Big West Pitcher of the Week in the Titans’ outright claiming of the conference title. Prior to allowing a run in the second inning in Game 1 of the series against the Matadors, she had a streak of 32 straight scoreless innings in her complete game pitching performance.</p>\n<p>When at the plate, part of the difficulties UCSB has had with putting runs on the board has been the lack of production over the last two series from two of its best hitters: Jessica Johnston and Sierra Altmeyer.</p>\n<p>They went a combined 0-for-14 in the Gauchos’ two losses to UC Davis, with the sole victory in the series being powered by Johnston’s three RBIs. Although these last two series were most likely a fluke for these two, seeing as overall they have both put together two of the best individual seasons in the conference, it surely isn’t the way they want to end the year.</p>\n<p>Others throughout the lineup have stepped up, but UCSB is going to need production from their third-spot and cleanup hitter if it’s going to have a chance in this series.</p>\n<p>Even with their offensive struggles, the Gauchos still have a statistically better offense than the Titans coming into the game. Yet, this does not mean that the Santa Barbara pitching staff can overlook Fullerton despite the team’s numbers not being that impressive; the Titans certainly have some great offensive players.</p>\n<p>One of those players is infielder Lexi Gonzalez. The senior leads the Titans in doubles (9), home runs (10) and RBIs (39) and is second on the team in triples (1) and hits (48). She had three RBIs and five runs in the last series alone, and it is going to be up to the Gauchos to find a way to stop her.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be looking for redemption on the defensive end in this series, as it has not really performed up to its usual standards lately.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last loss came at the hands of four unearned runs, and against a Titan team that has lost only three conference matchups this year, the margin of error is going to be that much slimmer.</p>\n<p>However, one bright spot recently through all this was freshman Lena Mayer’s (3-1) great pitching performance against UC Davis, during which she pitched a complete game and only gave up one run. Hopefully, the Gauchos build off of that game and bring that same energy and control into this series.</p>\n<p>Although first place is out of reach for UCSB, this series gives the Gauchos an opportunity to showcase their talent against the top team in the Big West and possibly get up to second place.</p>\n<p>Fullerton is going to be a tough opponent, but if the Gauchos get back to their usual offensive groove and the pitching staff steps up in a big way, then there is no reason that they can’t take this series.</p>\n<p>Overall, this season has been a huge success for the UCSB softball team, as it has put together one the best offenses in the Big West and has had solid contributions from all of its pitchers. Now the Gauchos can go out one last time and make sure that the rankings show that.</p>\n<p>First pitch between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton is Friday, May 12, at 3 p.m. Saturday’s doubleheader will take place at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. The series will be played at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veronika Gulvin (17-13), usually UCSB’s most solid pitcher, gave up four runs and was eventually pulled from the game in the fourth inning. The great hitting of Davis third baseman Ashley Lotoszynski certainly contributed to this early substitution, as she got both a homerun and triple to go along with her two RBIs on the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gulvin’s replacement Ashley Wright (4-3) fared a little better, with only one run earned on her part, however defensive mishaps amplified what was already a good offensive outing from UC Davis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with inconsistencies on the mound, the Gauchos offense was unable to get things going in during the game. Only two hitters, Kristen Clark and Stacy Cavazos, were able to get multiple hits this game as usual offensive stalwarts Jessica Johnston and Sierra Altmeyer both went hitless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big part of this was great pitching by freshman Katie Kibby (14-8), who leads the Aggies pitching staff with a 3.08 ERA. While she did give up seven hits, her ability to stifle any offensive outburst before they manifested into runs was what led to this shutout victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB tied the series up with a 3-1 victory on Saturday in the first game of a doubleheader. Right fielder Jessica Johnston led the Gauchos with two hits and three RBIs to account for all three of UCSB’s runs in the game. The offense as a whole was a bit muddled as only two other hitters even got a hit in the game. Much credit was due for Davis’ pitcher Andrea Reynolds (6-16) for that as even though she go the loss she pitched a great game only giving up four hits to what is considered one of the best offenses in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, junior pitcher Lena Mayer turned in a great pitching outing and got the win to show for it. Her game was very similar to Kibby’s in the game before, although she gave up seven hits she was able to stay composed and only give up one run. Mayer did a great job of limiting the Aggies’ most potent offensive threats, as their 1-5 hitters weren’t able to get even a single hit off of her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sole RBI for UC Davis belonged to freshman Marissa Jauregui in the top of the second, who hit a single to score senior Brianna Warner, but other than that it was smooth sailing for the Gauchos in their first win in the series.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smooth sailing turned into choppy waters pretty quickly however as the Aggies handed UCSB the series loss in the second end of the doubleheader on Saturday. Again the Gauchos offense did not rise to the occasion as they only put two runs on the board even after getting eight hits. While Katie Kibby didn’t shut UCSB out this time, she again did a great job minimizing the offense’s efficiency just enough to give UC Davis the upper hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively the Gauchos left much to be desired as none of the four runs put up by Davis were earned by Gulvin. Errors and a fielder’s choice helped nudge the Aggies offense in front, and in a game where again UCSB’s best hitters didn’t get a single hit near-perfection was needed out of the defense. The one bright spot was that the offense was definitely able to make contact, with four Gauchos having two-hit games, but other than that this game didn’t have too many positives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is no longer in competition for first place in the Big West, however the next series against current leaders CSU Fullerton will give the Gauchos a chance to move up in the rankings and show that they have first place talent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to finishing off the year strong will have to be taking advantage of having runners on base and maximizing their offensive efficiency, basically getting back to what they had done so well this whole year. If they are able to do that in their final games of the season then regardless of ranking they will have proven that UCSB is hands down one of the deadliest teams in the Big West.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Aggies have lost eight games out of their last 10, with the most recent disappointment being a series loss at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos trying to regain footing after being outscored by Hawaii by a deficit of 16-7, the struggling UC Davis team presents an opportunity to build up confidence again.</p>\n<p>Despite the low hit total, hitting hasn’t actually been the primary cause for concern for UCSB as of late, as it registered 23 total hits in its previous series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ biggest concern seemed to simply be transferring those hits into runs. This is easier said than done, but the Aggies will likely face an ambitious Santa Barbara team looking to keep up its hit count and hopefully capitalize with runners on base to increase the amount of runs scored.</p>\n<p>Heading into the start of the series Friday, Santa Barbara holds the offensive advantage over UC Davis, leading the Aggies overall as a team in runs, hits, home runs and RBIs with a collective .283 batting average, which trumps the Aggies’ average of .261.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, infielder Sierra Altmeyer has been a large part of their success this season. Holding down second base, the sophomore leads her team in batting percentage with a .382 clip on the year and is also one of her teams’ biggest power hitters while slugging .674.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer has nine home runs to go with an impressive 31 RBIs and 55 hits. Junior outfielder Jessica Johnston has been a big contributor for UCSB this season as well, batting .348 with 56 hits and 24 RBIs over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are led in batting percentage by senior utility Taylor Peters, who is batting .357 and has 46 hits for the year. While not batting at an extraordinary percentage this season (.254), junior infielder Ashley Lotoszynski leads her team with 27 RBIs to go with four home runs.</p>\n<p>UCSB sophomore pitcher Veronika Gulvin has led the team with 38 appearances and the team-best 2.77 ERA; however, with only one upperclassman pitcher, the Gauchos have struggled at times from the mound. The Aggies look to have the advantage when it comes to overall ERA, besting the Gauchos 3.64 to 4.14.</p>\n<p>The last time Santa Barbara faced UC Davis was last season in May, during which it swept the Aggies in Davis in three games.</p>\n<p>While UC Davis’s season is likely over following its last two series, UCSB is in decent position for the postseason. Sitting at 8-7, the Gauchos are tied with Long Beach State for third in the conference, with Cal State Fullerton and CSUN holding first and second place, respectively. Santa Barbara sits four games back from Fullerton, which it will host in its final series of the season.</p>\n<p>Although the Aggies are restricted by their last-place record at this point in the season, nothing’s stopping them from presenting a challenge for the Gauchos and fighting for a competitive series. The Gauchos will look to maintain their strength at home, where they have boasted a 13-4 record this year.</p>\n<p>The series kicks off at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 5, at Campus Diamond. The series will resume on Saturday, May 6, with a doubleheader starting at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/","id":1214,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1213,1212,1211],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Two From Long Beach To Maintain Conference Standing","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a loss in game one, the Gauchos rallied to win games two and three to help keep them in the race for a Big West championship.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Heading into the series, UCSB stood tied with CSUN for third in the Big West, holding a conference record of 5-4 and an overall record of 25-20.

Torres brought in junior outfielders Rachel Loera and Lauren Macleod as well as senior infielder Mattie Scheele.</p>\n<p>Due to the 49ers outhitting the Gauchos by 6-2, Long Beach pitcher Cielo Meza picked up her fourth win of the season. At 4-0, Meza has yet to lose a game this year. Gaucho pitcher Veronika Gulvin took the loss, setting her season record to 18-11.</p>\n<p>In the second game of the series doubleheader, UCSB fired back, defeating Long Beach 5-2. After three hitless innings for the Gauchos, they finally locked in, getting three hits leading to a two-run fourth inning.</p>\n<p>First, sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer brought in junior outfielder Jessica Johnston off of a double. Shortly after, Santa Barbara extended its 1-0 lead with senior infielder Emily Brucelas’s double to center, bringing in Altmeyer for the run and making the game 2-0.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State answered the Gauchos in the bottom of the fourth when junior utility Jessica Flores scored, courtesy of junior infielder Julia Lombardi’s double.</p>\n<p>The game remained at 2-1 until the top of the sixth, when Alyssa Diaz doubled straight down the right field line, bringing in Altmeyer for the score. Following the play, Diaz was at third.</p>\n<p>Diaz seized the opportunity to score off of a wild pitch, increasing Santa Barbara’s lead to 4-1. The Gauchos didn’t let up in the sixth, as Brucelas homered to left field and made it a four-run lead over the 49ers to start the bottom of the sixth.</p>\n<p>The 49ers made an effort to make up some ground against the Gauchos, as Lombardi went on to single to center and bring in Flores for the score. This made the game 5-2, but it was too little too late for Long Beach, who went scoreless in the final inning. For Santa Barbara, sophomore pitcher Ashley Wright picked up her third win of the season for a 3-2 record.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the series, both teams fought hard, pushing the game to an extra inning in which UCSB pulled ahead with a run to secure the 4-3 win.</p>\n<p>Long Beach, coming off the loss, struck early, scoring two runs in the bottom of the first and then another run in the bottom of the second. The early 49er scoring was thanks to Flores homering to left field, bringing in senior outfielder Sammi Gyerman in the process for the early 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos answered in the top of the second and third, scoring one run in each inning. Alyssa Diaz countered with a home run for Santa Barbara in the second, then Johnston hit a sac-fly to center field, allowing senior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa to score.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Long Beach, their hot start would end with their unearned run in the bottom of the second. UCSB took advantage of the 49ers going dry, with redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton singling to left field in the top of the fifth. Senior outfielder Kristen Clark would score on the play, tying the game up at three runs apiece.</p>\n<p>Both teams went scoreless in the next two innings, forcing a decisive eighth inning. The Gauchos wasted no time as they scored on a Brucelas single to third. A throwing error would allow Pemberton to score unearned. The 49ers didn’t answer, giving Santa Barbara the win 4-3.</p>\n<p>With yet another series win for the Gauchos, they sit at a competitive 7-5 in the Big West, while Long Beach falls to 8-4. This doesn’t shake up the conference standings too much, as CSUN remains right with Santa Barbara following a series win over Cal Poly.

Long Beach State came into this game with one of, if not the best, pitching staffs in the Big West, and Meza contributed greatly to to that, coming into the game with a 2.59 ERA. Wright came into the game sporting a 2.95 ERA, so it was not too surprising that up until the 4th inning neither team had a hit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos struck first however as infielder Sierra Altmeyer hit an RBI double to score former Big West player of the week Jessica Johnston. Altmeyer has been outstanding for the Gauchos this year batting .382 and leading the Big West’s most potent offense in home runs (9) and RBI’s (31). The sophomore was then brought in herself by Emily Brucela’s RBI double, pushing UCSB’s lead to 2-0 to end the top of the fourth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State had an answer in the bottom of the inning however, as sophomore Julia Lombardi hit a ground rule double which brought in infielder Nichole Fry. The 49ers, after two straight outs to end the inning, ended up stranding runners on second and third base which was an early sign of their inability to get runners on base home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sixth inning served as the period in which the Gauchos did the majority of their damage as they were able to extract three runs from two hits. Sophomore Alyssa Diaz started off the scoring with a double down the right field line to bring in Altmeyer, and she then advanced to third and scored on consecutive errant throws. Brucelas then came up and blasted a home run to left field to finish off her dominant offensive performance in Saturday’s game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game was crucial for Brucelas, who hadn’t gotten two hits in a game since April 9. Hopefully this game serves as a sparkplug for the senior, as getting another offensive standout in the lineup would help ease the pressure off of the 3-5 slot which has been powering the team so far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Julia Lombardi had another RBI in the bottom of the sixth to bring the deficit to three but the 49ers never got any closer as the Gauchos ultimately won the game 5-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a big game for the Gauchos as it allowed them to keep the goal of taking a series from the league leading 49ers intact. Getting five runs on the Long Beach State pitching staff was huge, as it simultaneously gave the UCSB pitchers room to work with and the UCSB hitters confidence moving forward that they can definitely hit off the best pitching staffs in the league.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning the next game would put UCSB in solid position to knock Long Beach off of its perch and take first place for itself, as its next ten games are all against Big West opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Gauchos keep batting as efficiently as they did on Saturday however, they won’t have too much to worry about in terms of wins and losses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game 3 is set for a 3 p.m. start on Sunday, April 23.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

There are plenty more opportunities for UCSB to climb the ladder in the Big West, particularly this weekend.</p>\n<p>Despite being below average in the overall wins and loss columns at 19-20, Long Beach State has ascended during the Big West schedule with its leading 7-2 record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos have a decent amount of momentum heading into this weekend, with four wins in their last six games, and could use it to knock off the first place 49ers.

Gaucho Jessica Johnston earned the Big West Softball Field Player of the Week for her performance against CSUN. Johnston, a junior outfielder for UCSB, brought in three runs in the last game facing the Matadors to secure the series win.</p>\n<p>Batting .364 for the year, Johnston owns the second best hitting clip on the team. This is an improvement on last season, in which Johnston held a .322 batting average. On the season, Johnston has four homers following her most recent shot over the right field against CSUN.</p>\n<p>Another leader for the Gauchos this season has been sophomore Sierra Altmeyer. The infielder has so far this season averaged a team-best .406 batting percentage. Aside from this impressive percentage, Altmeyer has homered nine times this season in addition to producing 30 RBIs, both team highs.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer and teammate Johnston will be looking to knock off the current first-place team this weekend while the 49ers will attempt to increase their lead in the league.</p>\n<p>Last season the 49ers won the series against UCSB, outscoring the Gauchos’ 26 runs to eight over the course of three games.</p>\n<p>Along with having to be aware of the 49ers’ bats, Santa Barbara will hope to combat LBSU’s thriving defensive play. Long Beach is coming off not allowing a single run in 28 innings in its series sweep of the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Much of Long Beach State’s success this year has been thanks to senior transfer Sammi Gyerman. The 49ers’ outfielder is currently leading the team in batting percentage with a .328 average in addition to scoring 12 runs for her team over the season thus far. Gyerman’s performance in the past week prompted her nomination for the Big West Softball Field Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Also leading the 49ers this season has been sophomore infielder Nichole Fry. After an impressive first season that saw the 2016 true freshman start all but one game, Fry has been batting an average of .289 this season to go along with a team-best 24 runs scored. Over the weekend, Fry recorded her second home run of the season, securing the 2-0 win for the 49ers over the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to Long Beach in hopes of making up for last season’s series against the 49ers, with Game 1 being held Saturday, April 22, at 1 p.m. Following Game 1, Game 2 will be held at 3:30 p.m. The series will end with Game 3 on Sunday the April 23 with a start time of 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77148\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77148\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/","id":1212,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1211,1210,1209],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Johnston Plays Hero in Gauchos Walk-Off Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-24-at-1.53.58-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-24-at-1.53.58-PM.png?resize=856%2C604&ssl=1","description":"Home field continues to work in the UCSB softball team's favor as it improved to 13-4 at Campus Diamond after a narrow 2-1 victory over Fresno State.

Gulvin was attacking the Bulldog hitters straight on, forcing easy pop ups and groundouts for the Gaucho defense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dung seemed unhittable for most of the game, as her ability to challenge UCSB’s hitters with a variety of speeds and elevations on her pitches led to an incredible 10 strikeouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresno State drew first blood however as junior Savannah McHellon, after a long at bat, drilled an RBI double right over second base to drive in Haley Fuller from second base. McHellon has been great this year for the Bulldogs, leading the team with 36 RBIs, and with the way the game was going it seemed that she had locked the victory up for Fresno State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos ended the fifth inning on the next at-bat by turning an unusual 3-5 double play, but the damage was already done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB then proceeded to leave runners in scoring position in both the bottom of the fifth and sixth inning, however, Gulvin kept them in the game by not surrendering any more runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though she threw a good game, there are still things we can talk about in terms of adjustments and not playing from behind,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “But ultimately [Gulvin] gives our offense a chance to figure stuff out if we start off slow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos opened up the bottom of the seventh inning with two straight singles from seniors Kristen Clark and Jacqueline Hinojosa respectively, following a leadoff strikeout. This then brought up Jessica Johnston who promptly ended the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The team’s ability to] make adjustments after coming out flat was key,” Galicinao said. “[Fresno State] was good preparation moving forward for Long Beach cause the pitchers throw pretty similarly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is going to have to be prepared for Long Beach State (19-20, 7-2 conference record) as the 49ers currently sit on top of the Big West standings and come into this next series on a three game win-streak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This next series is going to be part of a season ending twelve game stretch against conference opponents. UCSB is currently tied with CSUN for third place in the conference but if it continues to grind out victories, first place is right there for the taking.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Overall, Johnston comes into Wednesday batting .364 on the season with the most doubles on the team (12) and the second most hits (51) and has proven to be a key cog in the Gauchos offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresno State has an offensive standout of their own, however, as sophomore Morgan Howe has been stellar at the plate this year. Although she went a combined 0-4 in her last two appearances, the outfielder has put together an impressive slash line of .426/.512/.624 on the year and leads her team with 51 hits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB pitching staff will need to prioritize shutting her down as the Bulldog’s success has been inextricably linked to her production this year, however as her numbers prove this will be easier said than done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task of shutting down Howe and Fresno State’s potent offense will be given to the Gaucho’s pitchers, who have certainly risen to the challenge these last two series. Other than two extreme outliers, in the last six games the UCSB pitching staff has performed really well, shutting out opposing teams three times and giving the bats a comfortable amount of room to operate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Leading the way has been sophomore Veronika Gulvin (16-9), who has continued her impressive season claiming a team best ERA (2.73), the most innings pitched (159), and the most wins as well.

CSUN knocked her around in this one, accumulating 10 hits, six runs (four earned), two walks and two home runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got on the board in the bottom half of the first, as Altmeyer batted in Clark for the second-straight game, this time with a rocket double down the left-field line.</p>\n<p>A third-inning home run from freshman infielder Jessica Alexander swung the tide for the Matadors with the two-run shot that scored senior outfielder Taylor Glover (OF). Glover kept the momentum going in the fifth inning, scoring senior infielder Tara Kliebenstein on a sac fly to center field before Alexander smashed her second homer of the afternoon over the left-field fence.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had plenty more chances to score but were unable to capitalize on them, leaving four runners on base over the rest of the game. A pair of runs in the top of the seventh put the game out of reach for UCSB, evening the series at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Ashley Wright pitched a complete game shutout in Sunday’s second game, leading to a 4-0 Gaucho win that saw UCSB shutout the Matadors for the second time in the series. Pofek experienced her second loss of the weekend, as the top of the UCSB lineup was able to take advantage of the opportunities she provided once again.</p>\n<p>After yet another hit from Altmeyer, a first-inning single to center that brought home Clark on an error, Johnston gave the Gauchos a firm foot to stand on with a three-run shot to right field in the third inning.</p>\n<p>Wright carried UCSB the rest of the way, allowing only three more hits from the fourth inning onward and achieving her second credited win of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now stand at 24-20 on the season (.545 winning percentage) and hold a 5-4 conference record. The two wins mark their 11th and 12th home victories on the year, a much more comfortable place for the team to play, as away games have not gone so well (3-7 record).</p>\n<p>Johnston and Altmeyer continue to provide the Gauchos with scorching hot hitting, the former slashing .363/.400/.564 with four homers, 20 RBI and 12 doubles and the latter having hit a staggering nine home runs, 30 RBI and 10 doubles, all while drawing 21 walks and slashing .406/.490/.727.</p>\n<p>With those two leading the charge on offense and Gulvin (159 innings pitched, 12 complete games, 2.73 ERA) and Wright (2.72 ERA) holding it down for the Gauchos on the mound, UCSB has a clear path ahead to a very successful 2017 campaign.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play next against Fresno State in a one-game series at UCSB at 3 p.m. Wednesday, April 19.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77028\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-17/ucsb-pitches-two-shutouts-to-execute-series-win-over-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77028\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-17/ucsb-pitches-two-shutouts-to-execute-series-win-over-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-17/ucsb-pitches-two-shutouts-to-execute-series-win-over-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-17/ucsb-pitches-two-shutouts-to-execute-series-win-over-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-17/ucsb-pitches-two-shutouts-to-execute-series-win-over-csun/","id":1211,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1210,1209,1208],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Remains at Home in Search of 3rd Consecutive Series Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsTournament-170311-DustinHarris-07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsTournament-170311-DustinHarris-07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sitting in the middle of the pack of the Big West standings, the UCSB softball team is looking to ascend within the rankings in its second conference series of the season against CSUN at home.

Diaz was also nominated for Big West Softball Field Player of the Week following her solid weekend performance.</p>\n<p>Sierra Altmeyer has been an effective second baseman recently. The sophomore has been racking up career stats in her second season and could emerge to equally challenge the Matadors’ hitting. Altmeyer is batting .392, while at the same time leading the Big West in runs with 35.</p>\n<p>In the three-game series against UC Riverside, Altmeyer went six-for-nine at the plate.</p>\n<p>Aside from players with recent blow-up performances, a Gaucho to watch is senior outfielder Kristen Clark. Almost a month ago, the former Big West Freshman of the Year passed Christine Ramos to lead UCSB in all-time hits with an impressive 274.</p>\n<p>Clark has had spectacular seasons since her freshman year, and she’s still racking up numbers and helping a talented Gaucho team head in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Although it’s still early in the season, UCSB sits in a decent position of fourth in the Big West standings with there being a three-way tie for first between Cal Poly, CSUN and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have yet to play the Matadors this season, last year’s series between the two resulted in CSUN winning two of three games.</p>\n<p>The Matadors would go on to place second in the Big West, right behind the regular season champion for 2016, Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB placed fourth in the standings last year, finishing 28-28 and 11-10 in conference play.</p>\n<p>This CSUN series for UCSB should be competitive as well as a good test for both teams with the Gauchos and Matadors both looking to build off of last year’s performances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to avenge last year’s series loss against CSUN beginning at home Friday, April 14, at 3 p.m. and continue with a double header on Saturday, April 15, with games at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76867\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76867\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/","id":1209,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1208,1207,1206],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos looking to bounce back against a strong UC Riverside team","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsSanDiego-170324-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsSanDiego-170324-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering a series that could predict the foreseeable future of its season, the UCSB softball team is hoping its bats will propel it to victory over UCR.

The bats will be huge in amplifying the home field advantage that the Gauchos have done so well with this year which has played out in an 8-2 record at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Highlanders will hope they have the answer for UCSB’s offense, and they might not have to look too far as their pitching staff has been very good this year, led by ace Anessa Cepeda. Cepeda (6-1) comes into Saturday’s game with a 1.8 ERA and her fellow starters Tayler Misfeldt (8-2) and Haley Marschall (5-5) come in with 3.1 and 3.88 ERAs, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only place where UCR seems to have trouble this year has been the bullpen whose 0-5 record and near average of a nine ERA has led to quite a few losses. This will be a good test for UCSB’s bats to see if they hold rank against one of the better pitching staffs in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side, this series will provide the Gauchos with a great opportunity to improve what has been so far a lackluster output by the pitching staff. Sophomore pitchers Ashley Wright and Veronika Gulvin have been good throughout the year posting 3.05 and 3.04 ERAs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega has struggled in her debut season with a 6.41 ERA, and opponents have been hitting .294 against UCSB in total. This is a trend the Gauchos are going to have to change, especially seeing as the Highlanders are 0-12 when held to 2 runs or below.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCR will look to keep the pressure on UCSB’s pitchers, and sophomore infielder Hannah Rodriguez will play a big part in making that happen. She currently leads the Highlanders in batting average (.388) and doubles (7) and is second in hits (33). Outfielder Jenna Curtan leads the team in RBIs (18) and gives the lineup some lefty power while Senior Madeline Richard comes into Saturday’s game with a .365 batting average. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Highlanders are 15-1 when out-hitting their opponents, so the Gauchos’ ability to limit their best hitters will be key in securing a victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This series is going to be key for UCSB in determining the direction that its season goes. Defeating the team above them in the standings could certainly give the Gauchos the momentum to propel themselves up the Big West standings, however, losing this series will dig a hole that would be difficult to get out of. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tipoff between UCSB and UC Riverside is Saturday, April 8, at 1 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Sacred Heart, George Washington, and San Diego were responsible for the team’s three victories in its first three games (3-1, 8-1 and 7-4 respectively), while Northern Colorado handed the Gauchos their two losses (6-5 and 7-1).</p>\n<p>UCSB’s dynamite Saturday began in the mid-afternoon with a 2:20 p.m. start at Campus Diamond. The Gauchos struck first in a hectic bottom of the third inning begun by a single by senior left fielder Kristen Clark to left center field.</p>\n<p>Clark then stole second and advanced to third on a double from freshman first baseman Alyssa Diaz two batters later. With Diaz on second and Clark on third, sophomore second baseman Sierra Altmeyer reached on a fielders choice as Clark was thrown down at home.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With two outs and their backs up against the wall, redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton singled, first scoring Diaz, then Altmeyer on a throwing error by Pioneer junior centerfielder Lauren Delgadillo.</p>\n<p>Those two runs proved to be all the Gauchos would need, as Sacred Heart couldn’t muster much offense for the rest of the contest. They scored a run in the fifth after two doubles and a RBI single from Delgadillo, but sophomore starting pitcher Veronika Gulvin was fantastic for the Gauchos, throwing all seven innings and pushing her record to 7-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB bumped its record over .500 for the first time this season in Saturday’s next victory, this time over George Washington. Their seventh-straight win, the Gauchos wouldn’t need much scoring in this one either with pitchers freshman Felisha Noriega and junior Lena Mayer handling the Colonials with ease.</p>\n<p>Diaz was again at the center of the action for the Gauchos in the fourth, starting off the inning with a double to right center. Senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos would enter as a pinch runner and advance to third during the next at-bat, on an Altmeyer single into left field.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer advanced on a ground out from Pemberton, and the Gauchos then followed that sequence with more error luck. After a single from sophomore shortstop Melanie Menor hit home Cavazos and got Altmeyer to third, Menor advanced to second on another throwing error by freshman left fielder Jessica Linquist.</p>\n<p>Senior third baseman Emily Brucelas then hit home Altmeyer and advanced Menor on an infield single before pinch hitting junior infielder Samantha Lujan shot one to center field, scoring Menor from third. The mid-game outpouring would again be sufficient for the Gauchos, as Noriega would allow the team’s only run, notching her second win of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next game against San Diego on Sunday would prove more difficult than the weekend’s first two contests, though the Gauchos still collected their third win of the weekend 7-4. After taking a 2-1 lead in the fifth, a high-scoring sixth inning would tantalize those in attendance.</p>\n<p>Two singles to start the inning from sophomore left fielder Taylor Spence and junior right fielder Kailey Hill opened the floodgates for the Toreros. They capitalized later in the inning with back-to-back, two-out doubles, one off the bat of freshman shortstop Sara Silveyra, followed by one from freshman catcher Madison Casiano, scoring all Spence, Silveyra, and freshman outfielder Savannah Shields, who pinch ran for Hill.</p>\n<p>Gulvin would get the Gauchos out of the inning, setting up a wild bottom of the sixth. Junior center fielder Jessica Johnston came ready to play, slamming a triple down the first base line to open the frame. Diaz was next up, hitting Johnston home on a sacrifice fly to left.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer continued her hot streak, doubling to right center field, and scoring two batters later on a single from Lujan. With the game now tied 4-4, Menor singled to left, advancing Lujan to second. After a series of substitutions from both teams, pinch hitting freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez loaded the bases on an infield single to the shortstop, Silveyra.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then rallied off three quick runs, the first on a bases-loaded walk, the second again on an infield single to the shortstop and the third on yet another infield single, this time to the pitcher. Senior right fielder Jacqueline Hinojosa, senior left fielder Kristen Clark, and Johnston were responsible for the three RBI (Johnston got her second at bat of the inning).</p>\n<p>Gulvin was credited with the victory, moving to 8-4, and Noriega’s one inning of work earned her the first save of her season.</p>\n<p>Northern Colorado defeated the Gauchos twice Monday, 6-5 the first game and 7-1 in the second, dropping their record to 12-12 overall. The decisive inning in the former was the top of the fifth, in which sophomore third baseman Jordyn Wiatrak hit a grand slam after senior shortstop Erica Dick knocked in two batters on a double to left center.</p>\n<p>The first loss was credited to Gulvin, while Noriega would collect the second. After drawing initial blood in the bottom of the first with a sacrifice fly from Altmeyer that scored Menor, the Gauchos would allow seven-straight runs, never showing much promise for the rest of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>UCSB should absolutely be happy with the weekend, however, as the season starts anew, so to speak, with the Gauchos heading into the rest of the season 12-12. Next up for Santa Barbara will be Oklahoma and Loyola Marymount on Thursday, Mar. 16, with the latter hosting in Los Angeles.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

USD will have already played Northern Colorado, UCSB’s final opponent for the weekend, earlier Sunday morning, giving the Gauchos an edge in terms of rested legs.</p>\n<p>The offense has been up and down for San Diego, though sophomores Taylor Spence (outfielder) and Lauren Kane (corner infielder) have supplied the team with consistent options atop the lineup.</p>\n<p>Spence is slashing .381/.447/.429, followed closely by Kane whose line stands at .375/.432/.525. The two have combined for nine RBI, six doubles, eight walks and 12 runs, and Kane has even gotten herself a triple in the season’s early going.</p>\n<p>Senior righty Megan Sabbatini leads the team with 47.2 innings pitched, more than double Lauren Berriatua (senior) who has the team’s second most. She’s been shaky in all those innings, however, racking up a 5.73 ERA, 3-6 record, allowing 10 home runs and a .333 opponent batting average.</p>\n<p>UCSB ends the Classic with a doubleheader against a less than formidable opponent in Northern Colorado, losers of three straight, on Monday, March 13, with the back-to-back games starting at 1 p.m. The Bears come into this matchup with only a 5-14 overall record thus far.</p>\n<p>The Bears again receive their main hitting contributions from the dynamic duo of senior Erica Dick (infielder) and sophomore Jordyn Wiatrack (catcher/infielder).</p>\n<p>Dick has slashed .333/.394/.550 with three homers, three other extra-base hits, and eight RBI, while Wiatrack has crushed four home runs of her own, a team high, and leads the squad with 12 RBI and 36 total bases.</p>\n<p>Senior Jayme Reddacliff is the only consistent option for the Bears on the mound, already having thrown for an eye-popping 63.1 innings on the season. Her 5.12 ERA and .306 opponent batting average are red flags, though, especially when juxtaposed with her 4-8 record. Northern Colorado figures to provide the Gauchos with an easier opponent to conclude their first weekend of home games in 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB showed a continued ability to win close games this past weekend with four of their wins coming by fewer than three runs. Though the strategy is not a statistically sustainable one, the grit of this Gaucho team does not go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer is up to four home runs, three doubles and 11 RBI on the season, and freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston are both up to two home runs and 11 and 7 RBI respectively. The power hitting is starting to come around for a Gaucho team that was in desperate need of deep ball hitters.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Veronika Gulvin was able to up her record to 6-4 over this past weekend and get her ERA below four (it now stands at 3.82).</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega (1-4, 7.81 ERA) is still a questionable option behind her, but Gulvin has begun to prove that she is the ace this team was pining for.</p>\n<p>After catching their first wave of consistent winning play this season in Utah last weekend, the Gauchos will try to continue the trend back in sunny Santa Barbara at their first hosted tournament of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts the Gaucho Classic I beginning at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 11, at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/","id":43,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[42,41,40],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go Undefeated in Utah, Return Home for Gaucho Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Facing a must-win situation as the Big West schedule gradually comes closer, the UCSB softball team swept each opponent at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

With the Mavericks only recording four hits throughout the game, UCSB capitalized by getting the run it needed to win in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Following Sunday’s game, the Gauchos are now 3-0 when playing in extra innings.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos got out to a sluggish start against Southern Utah, giving up three early runs in the top of the first inning. For Southern Utah, senior first baseman Karlee Manzione homered and brought three runs in, allowing her teammates senior infielder/outfielder Payton Hart and junior outfielder Sarah Murphy to score.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasn’t fazed, however, as they answered back in the bottom of the first, starting with sophomore second baseman Sierra Altmeyer’s homer, which brought junior outfielder Jessica Johnston in to score as well.</p>\n<p>Both teams were off to fast starts, and the game sat at 3-2 Thunderbirds following the first inning. The Gauchos went on in the bottom of the second to tie the game 3-3 with the help of a single by Hinojosa, bringing freshman infielder Kayla Krantz in to score a run.</p>\n<p>After some scoreless innings for both teams, the Gauchos secured a one-run lead in the fifth. At this point the Gauchos held all the momentum, keeping the Thunderbirds at bay thanks to junior pitcher Lena Mayer, who got her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>With a shot from Johnston, Hinojosa was brought in, securing the Gauchos’ 5-3 victory over the Thunderbirds. Johnston went 4-4 at the plate during this, including bringing in Clark for a run with a single up the middle.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Gauchos faced off against a Nevada team that would be shut out in five innings by Gulvin, who earned 10 strikeouts. After two innings, the teams were tied at 0-0, but in the third a wild pitch from Nevada saw UCSB senior third baseman Emily Brucelas score. Brucelas went on to bring in Altmeyer for a 2-0 lead. Soon after, freshman infielder Whitney Pemberton brought in Hinojosa with a single.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of fifth, Nevada still scoreless at this point, the Gauchos increased their lead to 5-0 with contributions from Diaz and Altmeyer off of a sacrifice fly from junior infielder Samantha Lujan and a single from Brucelas, who went a perfect 3-3 at bat.</p>\n<p>Nevada finally scored with an effort from junior outfielder Aaliyah Gibson, allowing senior outfielder Raquel Martinez to score the sole run for the Wolf Pack. Beating Nevada 5-1, the Gauchos built off of momentum from their two wins Friday.</p>\n<p>On Friday, UCSB looked to keep things rolling against Iowa State following the morning win against Utah Valley. The Gauchos got on the board early with the help of Pemberton’s solo homer in the top of the second inning. In the bottom of the third, the Cyclones tied up the game with a run from senior outfielder Cathlin Bingham.</p>\n<p>The next three innings saw the advancement of a 4-1 Gaucho lead, beginning with a run from Pemberton in the fourth. In the fifth, Pemberton’s fourth double of the day saw Johnston score to establish a 3-1 lead. The Gauchos continued with another run in the sixth, thanks to a sac fly by Clark’s, which brought freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez home to make the game 4-1.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, the game appeared to be coming to a close. However, the Cyclones rallied with the help of a single from sophomore catcher Kaylee Bosworth and a homer from freshman infielder Talyn Lewis. With the game now a close 4-3, freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega came up big for the Gauchos with a final strikeout for her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Friday, the Gauchos competed against a talented Utah Valley team, squeezing a 9-7 win over the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>Following the second inning, the Wolverines were up 4-0 after a four-run inning. Pemberton finally got the Gauchos on the board with a double in the fourth to bring Altmeyer home. Following two runs from Clark and freshman catcher Nyssa Williams, at a second at bat in the fourth Pemberton doubled to bring in Altmeyer and Johnston for a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines used some momentum to rally and score three runs in the bottom of the sixth, making the game 7-5. Down two runs in the seventh, UCSB needed to come up big to secure a win, and they did just that. Pemberton made her presence felt again, hitting a double to bring Johnston home to make the score 7-6.</p>\n<p>Following a Krantz strikeout and with two outs on the board, UCSB rallied to make the game 9-7 with hits from Lujan and Hinojosa, allowing Altmeyer, Brucelas and Pemberton to score at home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos not only came up big on offense in the seventh, but they also shut out Utah Valley in the final inning to win the high-scoring game 9-7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 9-10 thanks to their 5-0 sweep in Utah. They will look to continue that energy as they play host to teams in the Gaucho Classic, which will tip off Saturday, March 11 at 1:30 p.m. at Campus Diamond. The Gauchos will play Sacred Heart to open their weekend and will also face George Washington, San Diego and Northern Colorado twice over the course of the Classic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/","id":42,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[41,40,39],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Softball Hoping To Shake Latest Slump at St. George Red Desert Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently on a two-game winning streak, UCSB softball is in a must-win situation at 4-10 heading into the weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Five games stand before the 4-10 UCSB softball team this weekend in Cedar City, Utah at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

Her partner in the infield, freshman Alyssa Diaz, will also be important to the Gauchos’ success this weekend, with two home runs and the same nine RBI in her first 14 games of college softball.</p>\n<p>The biggest test in Cedar City will be whether or not the Gaucho pitchers can come around after a rough start to 2017. Sophomore Veronika Gulvin and freshman Felisha Noriega have been the team’s stalwarts, but both have struggled mightily. Gulvin has three of the team’s four wins, and she holds the better ERA, but both have four losses, and “better” doesn’t necessarily mean good, with Gulvin’s ERA sitting at 4.56 and Noriega’s at 8.24.</p>\n<p>For the Wolverines, senior outfielder Courtney Beavers has been the team’s most impressive hitter, slashing .571/.625/.786, with three doubles, three runs scored and 11 total bases, all of which pace the team. Senior middle infielder Brittney Vansway has had a hand in much of the team’s production, knocking seven RBI in the season’s first four games.</p>\n<p>Junior Lauren Frailey leads the team with nine and a third innings pitched, and she has only allowed eight hits and two earned runs over that span. Senior Bailey Moore is close on her tail with eight innings thrown, and her 3.50 ERA isn’t too shabby either, suggesting the Gauchos will face a tougher path than the Wolverine’s 0-4 record would indicate.</p>\n<p>Iowa State (7-7) has been a streaky team to start the season, sweeping the Tennessee State Tournament the weekend of Feb. 17 before failing to win a game in the following weekend’s slate.</p>\n<p>Led by freshman infielder Sami Williams and junior outfielder Kelsey McFarland, the Cyclones pack an impressive punch offensively. Williams has slashed .300/.349/.625 to start the year, but somehow is being outdone by McFarland, who’s put up a .463/.521/.610 line.</p>\n<p>While Williams has the edge in RBI and home runs (11 to nine and three to one, respectively), McFarland gains her advantage having drawn three more walks, accumulated seven more hits and scored two more runs.</p>\n<p>The team boasts three impressive pitchers, all with ERA at or below 3.26. Sophomore Savannah Sanders is by far the team’s most relied-upon arm, as she’s thrown almost double the innings of her teammates (43) and appeared in 12 of Iowa State’s 14 games.</p>\n<p>Saturday will pit the Gauchos against the 8-5 Nevada Wolf Pack and the dynamic corner infield duo of sophomore Alyssa Mendez at third base and junior Jennifer Purcell at first. It’s been a hot start to the season for both, who’ve put up staggering hitting numbers as well as holding down the infield defense.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Kali Sargent and senior McKenna Isenberg head the pitching rotation, and the Gauchos will have to work their way around the two savvy, veteran throwers, who’ve accounted for the vast majority of the team’s innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The afternoon opponent for UCSB on the 4th will be Southern Utah, a 1-7 team that has failed to score more than three runs in all but one game. Five of the Thunderbirds’ games saw the team score one or zero runs, good news for a Gauchos pitching staff which struggled at the season’s onset.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Sarah Murphy is the team’s leading hitter with a .385 average, but her identical slugging percentage shows just how little extra base hitting she’s been able to provide the team. Sophomore utility player Kendall Kapitzke has the team’s one home run, and her .176 batting average is propped up by a .462 OBP.</p>\n<p>The Thunderbirds have tried several pitchers this season, but senior Kristen Hostetler has been the most relied upon, throwing in four games, starting a team-high three and doubling second place on her team with 16.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final match of the weekend will have the Gauchos face a Nebraska-Omaha team they were able to overcome 4-3 in extra innings at Stanford on Feb. 19. Since that game, the Mavericks have hit a losing streak, dropping four of their following five games.</p>\n<p>The lineup, which has been remarkably consistent with eight players starting and playing in all 13 of the Mavericks games, is led by two stud outfielders junior Kelly Pattison and senior Lia Mancuso. The former has a slash line of .359/.419/.615, three home runs, eight RBI and seven runs scored, while the latter has almost been her match, slashing .351/.400/.541, batting in four runs, taking one ball deep and collecting four doubles.</p>\n<p>Pitching has been more of a struggle for Nebraska-Omaha, with neither sophomore Laura Roecker nor senior Abbie Clanton, the team’s two main pitchers, having winning records or earning run averages below 4.00.</p>\n<p>Keys to the weekend will be the Gauchos’ ability to keep the game close, as they’ve had a penchant for getting blown out in games they lose. Furthermore, if the ‘Chos are able to get the bats firing and they can get up at least four or five runs per game, the pitching staff should be able to hold it down from there.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/","id":41,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[40,39,38],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"route":"/categories/sports/softball","highestPage":13}},"__N_SSG":true}
