The defeat places Santa Barbara in eighth-place of the Big West standings, its lowest ranking since finishing in seventh in 2007.</p>\n<p>Winners in eight of its last nine matches, Cal Poly boast a 16-5, 8-2 conference record. Its 16-5 overall record is its best start through 21 matches since 2006. Moreover, the Mustangs’ current Big West record is their best since 2008 and ties them for second-place in the standings with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>For the second time this season, three different Gauchos amassed double digit kills. Despite outhitting Cal Poly in the match’s first two sets, UCSB found itself having to play from behind, losing the first set.</p>\n<p>It was an assertive start by UCSB in the match’s opening as its energetic play generated a 4-0 lead over the Mustangs. But the Gauchos could not maintain their momentum as the occurrence of 10 UCSB errors helped fuel Cal Poly’s comeback to tie the score at 15-15.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs were able to benefit from the Gauchos’ mistakes, going on a 6-2 scoring rally to 21-18 lead to force a UCSB timeout. In spite of pulling within two at 22-24 with a block by junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Joos, a kill by sophomore Savannah Niemen captured the 1-0, 25- Cal Poly lead.</p>\n<p>The following set would go on to unfold in the same manner of a close battle between the two teams. Santa Barbara achieved another strong start, opening the set with a 6-3 lead but allowed a 4-0 Cal Poly run that gave the Mustangs a 7-6 lead. As both teams traded point, UCSB eventually took a late 21-19 lead. Determining the result of the second set was a trade-off of scoring runs. A 3-0 run helped Cal Poly go up 23-22, but the Gauchos responded with a 3-0 scoring rally of their own. Back-to-back kills by senior opposite Britton Taylor capped UCSB’s 25-23 win and knotted the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Helping lead UCSB to its tying set victory were senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau and senior opposite Jaylen Vllanueva. Although she stuggled with a match-high eight errors and a .061 attacking percentage, Barbeau registered 10 kills while Villanueva notched her third double-double of the season with 12 kills and 11 digs. The Gauchos also tied their season-high of 81 digs, led by 21 scoops from freshman Emilia Petrachi. They even outblocked the Mustangs 21 to 13 but that was not enough to prevent Cal Poly from securing the victory in the last two sets.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s defense achieved its goal of restraining Cal Poly’s freshman outside hitter Adlee Van Winden, holding her to just six kills on 51 attempts, it did not find a way to stop sophomore outside hitter Raeann Greisen.</p>\n<p>“They [Cal Poly] definitely played stronger towards the end of the match and that’s something that we need to fix, we were pretty flat in that last set,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch explained. “We gave up too many balls to Greisen in the seam. We needed to do a better job with our block on her.”</p>\n<p>Greisen continued her dominance against the Gauchos as she concluded Thursday with a match-high 14 kills. In addition to her performance, Niemen ended with 12 kills and a hitting clip of .450 while junior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald finished with 10 kills and a .348 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Offensively it was a tough night for both programs, but Cal Poly emerged with a match-high .294 attacking percentage in the third set. UCSB came within one, trailing 15-16 but could not maintain its hold on the Mustangs as they went on a 9-3 run to secure the set victory, extending their lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s momentum carried into the fourth set. It captured the lead and allowed just one early tie. The production of Greisen, Niemen, and Gruenewald happened to outperform the Gauchos’ play when it mattered most as they helped the Mustangs earn the 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB ended up with its fifteenth loss of the season, the Gauchos’ Joos felt indifferent about it being a negative for the team.</p>\n<p>“Mentally we won, even when we were down I felt like we were up. It’s just frustrating,” she said. “When I was out there, I could see that Cal Poly was scared. We just need to figure ourselves out and establish ourselves as a team better and have a little more pride.”</p>\n<p>UCSB gets a few days of rest without have any matches this weekend. It will resume play next Friday, Nov. 6<sup>th</sup> versus UC Davis at 7:00 p.m. The Gauchos will end their home stretch of three matches by facing UC Irvine on Saturday, Nov. 7<sup>th</sup> at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65993\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/career-night-from-ucsbs-joos-ends-in-3-1-loss-for-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65993\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/career-night-from-ucsbs-joos-ends-in-3-1-loss-for-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/career-night-from-ucsbs-joos-ends-in-3-1-loss-for-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/career-night-from-ucsbs-joos-ends-in-3-1-loss-for-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/career-night-from-ucsbs-joos-ends-in-3-1-loss-for-gauchos/","id":5076,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5075,5074,5073],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Cal Poly Looking for Upset Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Cal Poly defeated UCSB 3-1 the last time these two teams faced each other earlier this month.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The historical background of the Blue-Green rivalry between UCSB and Cal Poly requires no explanation when analyzing the intense competition both of these teams present when facing each other. Thursday’s matchup will be the second meeting between the UCSB women’s volleyball team and the Mustangs this season. Cal Poly’s 3-1 victory over the Gauchos on Oct. 10 was its first win over UCSB in four years. Santa Barbara attempts to even the season series up, hosting the Mustangs in the Thunderdome. Cal Poly has not won a match in the Thunderdome since Nov. 6, 2010.</p>\n<p>Owning a 6-14 overall and 2-7 conference record, UCSB looks to upset a Cal Poly team that has won seven of its past eight matches. Prior to its five-set loss to Long Beach State this past Saturday, the Mustangs had won seven straight. They currently hold a 15-5, 7-2 Big West record and are tied with LBSU for second place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Currently on a two-match losing streak after wins the week before, it seems like a possible change in the Gauchos’ starting lineup or rotation would be a possible solution to their setback. However, with just four seniors and a variety of players that have seen little to no time, the Gauchos do not have many alternatives to put on the court.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We don’t have a lot of options because we don’t have a lot of available people,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We have to get better at what we’re doing and we have to learn how to finish games and finish teams off.”</p>\n<p>Thursday being UCSB’s only match of the week, the Gauchos should be properly prepared for the Mustangs. They must find a way to prevent Cal Poly’s dominant duo of freshman Adlee Van Winden and Raeann Greisen. The two outside hitters have nicely complimented each other this season and are the team’s top two leaders in kills and kills per set average, owning a combined total of 249 kills and an 8.04 average. They shined in Cal Poly’s bout against UCSB earlier this year as Van Winden recorded 20 kills and Greisen added 17. Coming off her sixth Big West Freshman of the Week award after a weekend in which she recorded 38 kills and 21 digs, containing Van Winden along with Greisen will be a strenuous task.</p>\n<p>“They [Cal Poly] are going to set their outsides a bunch of times, they’re very good attackers from the pen,” Lantagne Welch said. “We actually did a pretty good job on Van Winden, even though she had a lot of kills. We feel like we didn’t give her a lot of ‘freebies,’ she had to really work for them. We have to be able to contain and score on our end.”</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to contain the Mustangs in their first bout. Santa Barbara outhit and outblocked Cal Poly, averaging a hitting clip of .239 and 18 blocks to the Mustangs’ .231 attacking average and 12 blocks.</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos’ inconsistencies to finish when playing in narrow sets has pestered the team for the majority of the season and was the deciding factor in Cal Poly winning the final two sets in their win over UCSB earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara played from behind in that matchup, causing a 1-1 tie in the second set of that match. But UCSB knows it must find a way to finish in hopes of avoiding another late-game letdown.</p>\n<p>“For us, it’s playing really good in the critical points,” Lantagne Welch said. “That was a determining factor in our match at Cal Poly and also affected us this past weekend. We need to get over that hump and have people that really want to be in a pressure moment come forward and play their best. We need more people to rise to that challenge and are excited about that challenge.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match between UCSB and Cal Poly will begin at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65871\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65871\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/","id":5075,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5074,5073,5072],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Inability to Close Leads to Disheartening Losses on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"After triumphant wins last weekend, inconsistencies in securing victories continue to plague the UCSB women's volleyball team as it experienced losses to Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.

CSUN’s 3-2 comeback victory over UCSB improves the Matadors’ record to 5-15, 4-4 in conference play and ending their four-match losing skid. Despite trailing by a deficit of two sets, Northridge managed to win in sets of 8-25, 19-25, 25-21, 25-23, and 15-10. Long Beach State added a couple wins to its record with its sweep of the Gauchos in scores of 26-24, 25-18, and 25-18 on Friday and its 3-2 win over Cal Poly on Saturday. The 49ers are now 17-5, 7-2 in Big West play and extended their home conference match winning streak to 16 games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday’s epic five-set battle between UCSB and CSUN was perfect exposure for an underrated Big West conference as the match was nationally televised on ESPN3. Despite being able to win the opening set in various matches this season, UCSB entered Saturday’s match 3-4 in games, in which it won the opening set — but never had the Gauchos lost with a lead of two sets.</p>\n<p>Arguably giving their best performance in a set this season, the Gauchos started with a 25-8 rout of the Matadors to open the match. CSUN absolutely had no match for the UCSB’s bruising offensive attack. Free of errors and a total of 10 kills, Santa Barbara had an astonishing .667 hitting clip. Continuing her phenomenal serving performance from the team’s previous contests, senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva notched four of her match-high six service aces in the first set, igniting UCSB’s season-high finish of 12 aces to help the Gauchos take a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s dominance continued in the second set as it followed its dynamic attacking clip with a .393 hitting percentage. Leading the Gauchos’ offensive charge was its barrage of hitters: Barbeau, senior opposite Britton Taylor, and junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt.</p>\n<p>The trio combined for 33 of the team’s 51 kills; Barbeau finished with a match-high 14 kills. Taylor ended with nine kills and a .368 attack percentage while Grunt had 10 kills in addition to her .529 hitting clip. Tied 11-11, a kill by Villanueva handed Santa Barbara its first lead in the second set and sparked the Gauchos’ 6-2 run, forcing two CSUN timeouts. In spite of the Matadors attempt to recuperate, UCSB would go on to take the 25-19 win to increase its lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s offense flourished, clocking a .488 hitting average in its two set victories, its defense prohibited the Matadors from gaining any offensive chemistry by holding CSUN to hitting clips of -.182 and .088. The Gauchos allowance of just eight points in the first set is the team’s lowest opponent point total of the season.</p>\n<p>Halting the Matadors’ attack attempts at the net were Taylor, Grunt, and junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield.  They accounted for the team’s three solo blocks with one apiece and were responsible for 16 of UCSB’s 26 block assists.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara outhitting Cal State Northridge with a kill average of .254 to .164, the Matadors’ comeback seemed impossible as they were on the brink of being swept.</p>\n<p>Down 0-2, allowing an 8-1 UCSB run to open the third set, it was plausible that a repeat of the first set was destined to occur. However, trailing 4-10, the Matadors’ 7-0 scoring stretch allowed them to take an 11-10 lead. Despite one lead change in which the Gauchos led 14-13, Northridge eventually regained the lead and captured the 25-21 set victory to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>A late 7-2 rally in the closing of the fourth set helped CSUN edge UCSB for the 25-23 win and 2-2 tie. With the momentum on their side, runs of 9-2 to open the fifth set and 5-1 to conclude it earned the Matadors their 3-2 come-from-behind victory.</p>\n<p>Guiding CSUN in its three-straight unanswered set wins were outside hitters senior Cieana Stinson and junior Julie Haake, who each had 13 kills.</p>\n<p>Prior to Saturday’s duel, UCSB’s loss at Long Beach State simply came down to the seemingly unstoppable success of the 49ers’ offense. Long Beach overpowered UCSB with a .374 hitting clip, earning a .472 attack percentage in the match’s final set. A total of three 49ers hit over the .500 mark, one of them being freshman outside hitter Carly Beddingfield, who recorded a match-high 12 kills in support of Long Beach sweeping UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the match with a sufficient .231 hitting clip but had no players with double digit kills.

UCSB looks to improve its 6-12 overall, 2-5 conference record against a recuperating 49er team and the declining Matadors.<br>\nLong Beach State is in search of regaining its dominance of the Big West as the 49ers now have two conference losses after a 2-3 loss to No. 8 Hawaii last Sunday. Still, they possess a notable record at 15-5 overall, 5-2 in Big West play. After a blazing 3-0 start to open its conference schedule, Cal State Northridge has been swept in its last three consecutive games. The Matadors’ latest slump leaves them with a 4-14 overall record, 3-3 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A pivotal asset to the Gauchos’ success in the past weekend, freshman setter Emilia Petrachi looks to capitalize on her tremendous play. Petrachi received Big West Freshman and Defensive Player of the Week awards for her remarkable performance in UCSB’s two victories. She finished the weekend with a total of 43 digs and an incredible average of 5.38 digs per set. Notably, since the start of conference play, Petrachi leads the Big West with an average of 4.92 digs per set. Her productivity will be vital to the Gauchos defending against Long Beach State’s offense, who ranks third in kills per set in the conference with a 13.33 average.</p>\n<p>Despite having its 23-conference-match winning streak snapped earlier this season, Long Beach State remains as one of the Big West’s most prominent teams when playing on home court. The 49ers have an active streakof 14 straight conference wins when playing in Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p>Guiding LBSU’s resilient home stand is the play of junior outside hitter Nele Barber. The Marquette University transfer has tallied double digit kills in all of the 49ers’ matches and owns a team-high of 297 kills, ranking second in the Big West. Barber has recorded a double-double and led Long Beach State in kills in 16 of 20 matches so far this season. Furthermore, she has led Long Beach State in kills for its last eight matches.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ last pit stop in their road trip through southern California is at Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s three-match losing streak comes as a result of playing the Big West’s top three teams in Cal Poly, Hawaii and Long Beach State. In two of the team’s three losses, the Matadors did not have one player in double digit kills. However, in its most recent loss to LBSU, senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson erupted for a tied match-high of 18 kills. Her average of 4.55 kills per set and 91 kills since the start of Big West play rank in the conference’s top five, respectively. The Matadors certainly are a better team after a grueling trio of matches and should not be overlooked heading into Saturday’s contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s inability to close out sets in its initial meetings versus LBSU and CSUN primarily led to the Gauchos’ 3-1 defeats to both teams. However, Santa Barbara showed some improvements by holding UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton to hitting averages below .200.</p>\n<p>“That’s something that we did well this weekend, playing well in the tight sets and finishing at the end,” Lantagne Welch explained. “If you’re keeping a team from hitting a good clip, they’re going to get frustrated and make more errors. At the same point, if you can attack well and get enough kills from enough spots you’re going to score points. Those are two critical things, that we’re sharp on both sides of the ball.”</p>\n<p>The start time of UCSB at Long Beach State is set for Friday, Oct. 23rd at 7:00 p.m. at Walter Pyramid. The following day’s match at Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Oct. 24th will take place at 7:00 p.m. in the Matadome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/","id":5072,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5071,5070,5069],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Conference Win, End 11 Match Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVolleyball-12-of-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVolleyball-12-of-20-web.jpg?resize=600%2C401&ssl=1","description":"In its return to the Thunderdome, UCSB women's volleyball earned its first conference and home victories of the season.

Past games have kind of been like, ‘what is going on, why can’t we do this?’ But tonight was a reminder that not all hope is loss, we’re going to figure this out. It’s still early in conference and we have to keep reminding ourselves that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 3-1 victories over UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton this weekend reflected the winning team that we all witnessed in the beginning of the season. Along with ending their winless streak, UCSB earned its first conference and home victory of the season. For the first time since participating in the Yale Invitational on Sept. 4<sup>th</sup>-5<sup>th</sup>, the Gauchos have won back-to-back matches and are now on a two-match winning streak. Santa Barbara’s latest wins improves its overall record to 6-12 and 2-5 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This weekend is big for our team and momentum moving forward,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch stated. “We we’re flat to start both matches, but I love the way we came back in the last three sets. “The realization is that we can beat anybody in this conference when we really work for it and execute.”</p>\n<p>The defeat hands Cal State Fullerton its 18<sup>th</sup> loss of the season, and extends the Titans’ losing streak to 21 matches in continuation of last year’s winning slump. Fullerton remains winless at 0-18 and its 0-6 conference record makes the Titans the only Big West team without a conference win. UC Riverside is now 6-14, 1-6 in conference after losing to UCSB on Friday and Cal Poly on Saturday. The Highlanders’ pair of losses extends their losing streak to six matches.</p>\n<p>Having momentum from the previous night’s victory and facing a winless team, it was assumed that Saturday’s match versus Cal State Fullerton would be a lopsided win for UCSB. But the Titans came into the Thunderdome and stunned the Gauchos by taking a 25-20 win in the opening set. It was Fullerton’s first set-victory after being swept in its last three matches.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded points throughout the initial set, not allowing each other to gain a lead bigger than a margin of one. It wasn’t until the two teams were knotted at 18 that Cal State Fullerton managed to break away. A kill by senior setter Mackenzie Olsen set the tone for the Titans’ 7-2 run. Closing out Fullerton’s victory was freshman outside hitter Kyra Smith, who led the team with 11 kills.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, UCSB had a total of three players with double digit kills in one match. Leading the Gauchos’ stellar offensive attack was senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva. She recorded a match-high 15 kills to go along with a .306 hitting clip and 10 digs.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for this time,” Villanueva said. “I’ve been waiting for a win. All of us worked really hard to get each other fired up to pull off these two wins this weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s attack was at its best in the second set. The Gauchos hit for a match-high .433 hitting percentage and went on an 8-1 run to secure a 25-12 victory that tied the match at 1-1. Backing Villanueva’s performance was the tremendous play of senior opposite Britton Taylor and Grunt. The two Gauchos registered 13 kills and helped UCSB obtain its .302 hitting average for the night.</p>\n<p>Similar to the match’s opening, it was a battle for the lead in a pivotal third set. But the Gauchos’ rhythm on offense continued as they went on an 8-2 run to snag the 2-1 lead, winning by a score of 25-19.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton had no chance against UCSB in the final set. Villanueva tallied five straight kills to open the fourth set which paved the way for the Gauchos’ 25-10 rout of the Titans and their 3-1 match victory.</p>\n<p>“After last night, it gave us a confidence booster,” Taylor said. “Tonight we came in with the same mindset and belief in each other which really helped us pull through and get the win.”</p>\n<p>Providing Santa Barbra with that confidence boost was Friday’s win over UC Riverside. Despite trailing after losing the first set 15-25, the Gauchos persevered to win the match’s final three sets in scores of 25-20, 25-19, and 25-18.</p>\n<p>Besides UCSB’s equalizing victory in the second set in which it earned a .275 hitting clip, it was a poor hitting match for both teams. Santa Barbara clocked a .152 hitting percentage, while Riverside finished with a .065 attacking average. Despite UCR’s struggles offensively, senior outside hitter Helena Peric ended the evening with a match-high 14 kills.</p>\n<p>Helping guide UCSB to victory was Grunt, who had a team-high 13 kills and a match-high .500 hitting clip. She certainly put her bid in as a Big West Player of the Week nominee after a weekend in which she finished with a total of 26 kills, nine blocks, and a .489 hitting average.</p>\n<p>“The great thing about Phoebe was she was on from the first moment,” Lantagne Welch said. “Whereas our team was really flat in set one, she came to play with energy and fire. She was going to find a way to put the ball to the floor.”</p>\n<p>While No. 8 Hawai’i and Long Beach State are destined to finish within the top two spots of the Big West, UCSB’s opportunity to prove itself as deserving of the conference’s pick to finish third is still possible with nine matches left.</p>\n<p>Next for Santa Barbara are road matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/","id":5079,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5078,5077,5076],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos On the Cusp of First Big West Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Fans of the Thunderdome have yet to witness a UCSB women's volleyball victory on home court this season.

If we play again like we played against Cal Poly on Saturday, I expect to have some good results. That’s what’s important, to keep improving, and then they’re going to see the results come.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will host UC Riverside on Oct. 16 and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. The Gauchos are currently 4-12, 0-5 in Big West play and in search of their first home victory of the season. Ranking one spot above UCSB in the conference standings is UC Riverside. The Highlanders enter the Thunderdome at 6-12, 1-4 in Big West play, and are on a four-match losing skid that has seen them get swept in their last three matches. In dire need of a win is Cal State Fullerton. The Titans are 0-16, 0-4 in conference and are on a 19-match losing streak dating back to the end of last season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In spite of UCSB’s troubles this season, inscribing her name among the best liberos in the Big West is freshman Emilia Petrachi. She ranks second in the Big West with an average of 4.38 digs per set and fifth in total digs with 228. The possibility of a Gauchos’ win is extremely convincing to Petrachi, who believes UCSB still has a chance to contend in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We’re really confident, considering the past weekend’s games,” Petrachi said. “We played really good, we didn’t win but they were a tough team. I think that we can beat every team in the conference, especially the two that are coming this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Dating back to 2008, UC Riverside has continuously plummeted, finishing last in the Big West for nearly the past eight consecutive years. The 2014 season was one of its worst outings in program history. For the third time, last in 2006 and 2010, UC Riverside ended its season with zero conference wins and a 22-match losing streak that eventually came to an end in UCR’s 2015 season opener against Weber State.</p>\n<p>Despite having four players on their team with 125-plus kills this season, the Highlanders’ multitude of errors has prevented their high-powered offensive attack. UCR ranks second in the Big West in total errors with 382, which has contributed to the Highlanders having the second-worst hitting average at .170.</p>\n<p>However, along with UCR’s arsenal of hitters, the Highlanders’ junior libero Maddie Hubbell is currently having the best season of her collegiate career. The defensive specialist’s total of 315 digs and average of 4.77 digs per set lead the Big West. Prior to the start of the Big West schedule, UCR ranked third in digs per set with an average of 15.09.<br>\nSince the start of conference play, the Highlanders sustain their third-place ranking with 15.1 digs per set. Hubbell is also a one-time Big West Defensive Player of the Week recipient after recording a career-high 32 digs in a match against Nevada earlier this season, and is responsible for 15 of UCR’s second-best conference total of 90 service aces.</p>\n<p>As one of four seniors on the UCSB roster, opposite Jaylen Villanueva has developed under the guidance of Welch. It has been a frustrating stretch for the Gauchos, but the veteran player has learned to help the team, specifically its younger talent, maintain its composure throughout its arduous stretch of matches.</p>\n<p>“We honestly tell them to play with all of their heart,” Villanueva said. “To constantly keep fighting because volleyball is the type of sport in which it can go either way, if someone’s off or if someone’s on. We just have to keep fighting no matter what.”</p>\n<p>Following Santa Barbara’s Friday match, UCSB closes out its weekend on a Saturday evening versus Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Last season was the first time the Titans didn’t register double digit wins since 2003. Nov. 15, 2014 is the infamous date of Fullerton’s last victory. Despite the drawbacks of this season, freshman outside hitter Kyra Smith has shined on the defensive side of the net. She leads the Titans in total blocks with 53 and since the start of conference play, Fullerton ranks third in blocks per set with a 1.7 average.</p>\n<p>The anticipation of UCSB earning its first conference victory is inevitable as this weekend provides the Gauchos with their best opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>“We just need to play like how we practice,” Petrachi said. “Sometimes we go frantic on the court and we’re not loose enough. We’re always there, but we never close and make a win. This is a great opportunity to get that win.”<br>\nUCSB faces off against UC Riverside Oct. 16 at 7 p.m. and will take on Cal State Fullerton at 7 p.m. on Saturday in its return to the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65401\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-on-the-cusp-of-first-big-west-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65401\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-on-the-cusp-of-first-big-west-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-on-the-cusp-of-first-big-west-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-on-the-cusp-of-first-big-west-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-on-the-cusp-of-first-big-west-win/","id":5071,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5070,5069,5068],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Continues to Struggle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Two more losses keep the Gauchos winless in Big West play.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65227\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"736249746\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65238\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65227\" data-attachment-id=\"65227\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/emilia-petrachi-bump-sets-the-ball-to-her-teammate-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Emilia Petrachi bump-sets the ball to her teammate.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The past month has been an absolute catastrophe for the UCSB women’s volleyball team. It was assumed that the start of the Big West schedule would be a revitalizing change to its dwindling season, but UCSB’s downward spiral continues as the team remains winless in conference matches.</p>\n<p>Losses to UC Davis on Thursday and Cal Poly on Saturday handed Santa Barbara its fifth-straight Big West loss and dropped the Gauchos to 4-11 on the season. The Aggies improved to 9-11, 4-2 in conference matches after sweeping both UCSB and Cal State Fullerton, extending their winning streak to four-games. Cal Poly’s current 12-4 overall record is its best start through 16 matches since 2010. The Mustangs are now 4-1 in Big West play after Saturday’s 3-1 victory over UCSB and are currently on a four-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Despite tallying its 11th-consecutive loss, UCSB consistently applied pressure on Cal Poly in all four sets, outhitting and outblocking the Mustangs in the match’s end result. Santa Barbara registered a .239 hitting clip while Cal Poly ended with a .231 attacking percentage. Furthermore, the Gauchos outblocked Cal Poly 18 to 12, but could not contain the Mustangs in the final two sets. Cal Poly’s largest winning margin in a set was five points in the match’s opening. Its 3-1 win versus Santa Barbara occurred in sets of 25-20, 26-28, 25-22, and 25-23.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We played great at Cal Poly,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “It’s one of those match’s where it comes down to a couple points here and there. It was extremely evenly matched, it was extremely high level volleyball. It’s the best that we played in a long, long time and it’s just unfortunate that we didn’t come out with a win because we really played well.”</p>\n<p>It was a disappointing first set for UCSB as it recorded just nine kills, in addition to a .097 hitting percentage. While Cal Poly managed to sustain a lead throughout the set’s entirety, a 4-0 run that consisted of kills by senior opposite Britton Taylor and senior libero Shauna Klein, along with a block and Mustangs’ service error, helped bring UCSB within one at a score of 9-10.<br>\nAfter missing last weekend’s two matches due to injury, the return of redshirt senior setter Hanna Nielson enhanced the Gauchos’ scoring opportunities with her passing. She was responsible for 28 of the team’s 57 assists and provided a monumental service ace that tied the score, 16-16.</p>\n<p>As both teams traded points, the likelihood of an extra-point set seemed definite with the score knotted at 19-19. However, the Mustangs’ 6-2 run to close out the set earned them the 25-20 victory. Scoring half of Cal Poly’s final six points was its star freshman outside hitter Adlee Van Winden. It was the beginning to a spectacular night for Van Winden, who ended the match with a double-double. She recorded 20 kills, just one shy of tying her career-high, and 10 digs.</p>\n<p>Despite Van Winden’s surge to help Cal Poly take the 1-0 lead, UCSB’s extra-point win in the second set kept the Gauchos’ aspirations of winning their first conference match alive.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara played its best volleyball during this stretch of the match. It recorded a match-high .400 hitting clip and 22 kills. For UCSB, it was the outstanding offensive performances by senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau, junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield, as well as Taylor that ultimately led to the Gauchos’ 28-26 win to tie the match at one apiece. Barbeau ended the match with a team-high 17 kills, Grunt with 10, Sheffield and Taylor with nine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ tremendous hitting influenced their vigorous defense at the net. Fourteen of UCSB’s 18 blocks were produced from the stout defense of Sheffield, Taylor and Grunt.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB excelled on both ends of the court, Cal Poly’s duo at the outside hitter position was too overwhelming. Mirroring the great play of Van Winden was sophomore Raeann Greisen. She notched a total of 17 kills to help Cal Poly prevail for the 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>The focus heading into Thursday’s match against UC Davis was finding a way to “slow down” the Aggies’ senior outside hitter Kaylin Squyres. Despite her match-high 17 digs, the Gauchos certainly achieved their goal, holding Davis’ star to five kills out of 29 total attempts, a -.103 hitting clip, and a match-high eight errors.</p>\n<p>“We did a really good job with Squyres, that’s probably one of the worst matches she’s had against us ever,” Lantagne Welch said. “The problem was their other outside hitter, No. 14 had a huge match and we had no answer for her. So while we really did a nice job on one of them, we couldn’t contain another player and we needed to do a better job with that.”</p>\n<p>Wearing the No. 14 for the Aggies is none other than junior Kendall Walbrecht. Her 17 kills and .406 hitting average proved to be too much against a stagnant UCSB defense. The combination of Walbrecht’s stellar performance along with Santa Barbara’s disheveled offense, who collected a total of 18 errors and a .114 hitting clip, powered UC Davis to its sweep of the Gauchos in sets of 25-21, 25-10, and 25-20.</p>\n<p>Next in line on UCSB’s schedule are home weekend matches versus UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/","id":5070,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5069,5068,5067],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Still Chasing First Conference Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Despite great performances in the first set of its last two matches, the UCSB women's volleyball team has yet to end its nine-game losing streak.

You just have to deal with it and make the best of it.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies welcome UCSB with a 7-11 record, and despite going 0-2 in its conference opening weekend, UC Davis is now 2-2 in Big West play after consecutive 3-1 victories over UC Riverside and UC Irvine this past week.<br>\nDavis certainly has the upper hand heading into tonight’s matchup as the Aggies defeated UCSB in both of last season’s meetings, sweeping the Gauchos in the first contest and stealing a five-set victory the second time around.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Simply having her way against Santa Barbara last year was outside hitter Kaylin Squyres. Now a senior, Squyres tallied a total of 38 kills and 20 digs in the two matches played, in which 24 of her kills occurred in the team’s second victory. After leading the Big West in kills (441) and kills per set (4.12) last season, there’s no indication that Squyress’ dominance on the court will be ending any time soon as she is on pace to be crowned the statistical leader in both categories for consecutive seasons.</p>\n<p>Squyress currently leads the Big West in kills (317), kills per set (4.73), and ranks third in total digs (241). She was named the Big West Player of the Week after back-to-back 20-plus kill performances (24 vs. UCR, 25 vs. UCI) in Davis’ last two conference meetings. Notably, Squyres became just the ninth player in Aggie history to surpass 1,000 career kills as she now has 1,023.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a go-to player in Squyres,” Lantagne Welch said. “You’re certainly not going to shut her down, but we have to at least slow her down. The best way to counterattack a good hitter is to put the ball away when you have your opportunity.”</p>\n<p>While Squyres has been the focal point of the Aggies’ success, the entire Davis team has played incredibly well. It leads the Big West in total kills (882), assists (833), service aces (93) and digs (1,022). Also, along with Squyres’ conference honor, freshman libero Malia Bolko received her first career Big West Defensive Player of the Week award after amassing a total of 42 kills and an average of 5.25 digs per set in Davis’ Thursday and Saturday wins.</p>\n<p>Despite its shortcomings against UC Davis, the results of last season’s classic “Blue/Green” rivalry matches were to the advantage of the Gauchos. UCSB opened its 2014 conference schedule against the Mustangs, winning a rigorous five-set match and finished its season in San Luis Obispo with a 3-1 victory over Cal Poly. Santa Barbara’s last loss to Cal Poly was on Oct. 12, 2011.</p>\n<p>However, the 9-17, 4-12 team that existed last season has renovated its program and is currently peaking, making a statement as the Big West season unfolds. It has nearly been 10 years since the Mustangs last ended a season as conference champions. They conquered the Big West in the years 2006 and 2007, earning back-to-back conference champion honors.</p>\n<p>Fresh off a weekend in which it upset Long Beach State and swept Cal State Northridge, the Cal Poly Mustangs arguably are the Big West’s most improved team this season, harboring a 10-4, 2-1 conference record.<br>\nLeading the Mustangs’ winning crusade is freshman outside hitter Adlee Van Winden. A definite candidate for the Big West Freshman of the Year award, Van Winden steered the Mustangs to their upset over Long Beach State which knocked the 49ers out of the AVCA Top 25 rankings. She produced a career-high 21 kills, helping Cal Poly end LBSU’s 23-match conference streak. Following Friday’s triumph, she registered 12 kills in the Mustangs sweep of CSUN.</p>\n<p>Van Winden’s phenomenal performance earned the first-year player her fourth Big West Freshman of the Week honor. While class standing places her within the Class of 2019, her performance on the court makes her seem like a veteran. Van Winden ranks fourth in the Big West in kills (205) and third in kills per set (3.94). It is evident that she has put much time into her attacking technique as she has notched double-digit kills in 13 of the team’s 14 matches this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s winless streak has yet to come to an end, but the Gauchos have made progressive strides over the course of their three conference games. Santa Barbara won the first set in both of its last two matches, but must learn how to maintain its lead throughout the game’s duration.</p>\n<p>“Our energy level is huge for that,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “The previous week we had talked about starting slow so we made the change and got good starts. Now we just need to maintain it and restart at each set of every match.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match between UCSB and UC Davis will begin at 7:00 p.m. at The Pavilion and will have a day off before facing Cal Poly on Saturday at 7:00 p.m. at the Robert A. Mott’s Athletic Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65119\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65119\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/","id":5080,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5079,5078,5077],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Suffers Third Straight Conference Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-1 loss to CSUN puts the Gauchos in a difficult position through three games in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65009\" style=\"width: 292px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1703263172\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65022\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65009\" data-attachment-id=\"65009\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/alexis-rottman-tips-the-ball-over-the-net-spencer-brandtdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Spencer Brandt\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Alexis Rottman tips the ball over the net.

Spencer Brandt/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>While losing isn’t an embracing result, a team’s attitude after its loss definitely influences its performance on the court. Despite falling to 4-10 and 0-3 in conference, the demeanor of the UCSB women’s volleyball team remains resolute as it continues to search for its first win in nine games.</p>\n<p>Through just three games, Santa Barbara has now faced the top three programs in the Big West. It managed to win the opening sets in both of its matches, but became prone to allowing various scoring stretches, which led to UCSB losing three consecutive final sets to end the game in its two home conference openers. Missing from UCSB’s starting lineup this weekend were two of its most prominent players in redshirt senior Hanna Nielson and sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman.</p>\n<p>Prior to the beginning of Big West play, Cal State Northridge was once in the same losing quandary as the Gauchos. The Matadors entered conference play with an eight-game losing streak but have recently been the most astounding team, winning its first two conference matchups. CSUN overcame its early set loss and improved to an undefeated three wins in conference, beating UCSB 3-1 in set scores of 25-27, 25-14, 25-20 and 25-20. The Matadors are now 4-12 overall with a 3-1 Big West record after losing to Cal Poly yesterday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Matadors seemed destined to win the initial set, facing set-point with a 24-21 lead that led to a UCSB timeout. Yet, the quick break benefited UCSB as it made a substitution that put senior opposite Britton Taylor in the game. The change in rotation was the starting point in the Gauchos’ comeback as Taylor thumped the ball for a kill, trimming the deficit to two at 22-24. Back-to-back kills by freshman Annie Hasselmann and junior Elizabeth Sheffield put the finishing touches on Santa Barbara’s 6-1 run, securing the set victory 27-25.</p>\n<p>After achieving a .381 hitting clip in the first set, UCSB’s offense continued to prosper as it opened the second set with a 4-0 run. But Northridge responded with a 6-0 rally of its own to take a 6-4 lead and force a Santa Barbara timeout. The Matadors never lost the lead again and a 9-3 run locked a 25-14 second set win.</p>\n<p>During the second set and latter periods of the match, there was some displeasure expressed by UCSB Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch toward the officiating. Specifically, her complaints were directed toward the line judge for some calls that seemed to favor the Matadors as they went on to win sets three and four.</p>\n<p>When asked if the calls had an influence on the match’s result: “it had an influence on some of the frustrations, but we’ve got to clean up our side of the ball and that’s something uncontrollable that we can’t worry about,” she said. “We played great in set one, we hit over .300 which is excellent. We have to realize that teams are going to adjust and we have to be more adaptable. We have to be quicker to adjust and I think that was something that hurt us tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended Friday’s match with a .164 hitting average while CSUN managed to hit a clip of .200 plus throughout the match’s entirety (.323 match average). Senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson led the Matadors’ assertive attack with a match-high 19 kills. Northridge’s best hitting performance appeared in the fourth set — it clinched victory with a dominant .448 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>A repeat of last season’s 16-0 conference record is now fictitious for No. 24 Long Beach State after being upset 3-1 by Cal Poly on Friday, snapping the 49ers’ 23-match Big West winning streak. However, LBSU accepted the loss and is back to its winning ways after its 3-1 victory over UCSB.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB managed to take advantage of the vulnerable 49ers in the first set of Saturday’s contest. A 9-4 run set the tone for its offense — three-straight service aces by Sheffield helped Santa Barbara finish the opening set with a .452 hitting clip. UCSB maintained its lead, but LBSU trimmed the deficit to four-points at 15-19, which led to a Santa Barbara timeout. It helped prevent a shift in momentum which led to the Gauchos’ protecting their lead and earning the 18-25 set victory.</p>\n<p>Hoping to avoid consecutive upset losses, Long Beach State answered back with a 25-19 win in the second set. Starting the third set with a 7-1 run, Santa Barbara inched closer to a 2-1 lead. But the 49ers’ 8-2 run notched the score at 9-9. A series of lead changes and ties would occur, when tied 24-24, kills by freshman outside hitter Megan Kruidhof and freshman libero Mykah Wilson snagged the 26-24 third set victory for Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The results of the third set proved to be the deciding factor in yesterday’s match. “They started taking more chances with their serve and we couldn’t answer — we got stuck in a couple rotations,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need to be able to answer quicker because we were in control of that set.”</p>\n<p>In spite of double-digit kill performances by seniors Ali Barbeau and Taylor, as well as 39 assists by freshman setter Annie Hasselmann , the 49ers’ stunning .625 hitting percentage in the match’s final set stamped their victory. LBSU sits at 13-4, 3-1  in conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB finds itself on the road for weekday and weekend matchups. The Gauchos will face UC Davis this Thursday, Oct. 8 at 7:00 p.m. at The Pavilion. On Saturday, Oct. 10, they will visit Cal Poly for a 7:00 p.m. match in Robert A. Mott Athletic Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/","id":5073,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5072,5071,5070],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain Motivated Heading into Conference Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C480&ssl=1","description":"After a difficult conference opening match against No. 10 Hawai'i, UCSB women's volleyball knows the pressure is slowing rising and wins versus Cal State Northridge and No. 24 Long Beach State this we...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Adversity is an essential element of sports.

During non-conference play, the Gauchos averaged a .206 hitting clip. However, in their conference opener, they achieved a dismal .121 hitting percentage. Since losing 3-1 to SMU, the Gauchos have not had two players record double digit kills in the same contest.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing is we just have to keep getting better,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “If we keep getting better, we’re going to start to see the results we want in terms of the scoreboard.”</p>\n<p>Despite having just one win prior to the start of Big West play, Northridge has triumphantly kicked off its conference schedule. The Matadors, now 3-11, are on a two-game winning streak after sweeping UC Irvine and a 3-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Through just two conference games, CSUN sits atop the Big West in various statistical categories. Northridge currently leads the conference in kills (110), kills per set (15.71), assists (100), assists per set (14.29), and points (135.0).</p>\n<p>Bearing the offensive torch for the Matadors is senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson. She has been a key centerpiece to CSUN’s progression as she leads the team in kills (182) and blocks (24). Stinson has recorded double-digit kills in nine of Northridge’s games, and just this past Monday was named Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week. A well-deserved honor, as Stinson is coming off a weekend in which she tallied a total of 39 kills and averaged 5.57 kills per set to compliment a smashing .423 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Molding into Northridge’s next elite star at the outside hitter position is freshman Aeryn Owens. Despite a meager .127 hitting average so far this season, she ranks second in CSUN’s kills total with 111. Since the award’s creation prior to the 2014 season, Owens became the first Matador to receive the Big West Freshman of the Week award after chalking up 29 kills and a .313 hitting percentage in the team’s first two conference matches.</p>\n<p>The reigning champions of the Big West Conference, Cal State Long Beach has its eyes set on a repeat performance of its undefeated, 16-0 conference record of last season. Currently 12-3, the 49ers are off to an emphatic start at 2-0 after last weekend’s home conference opener.</p>\n<p>Cal State Long Beach’s determined foundation of players certainly helped pave the way for the 49ers’ success. Last season’s Big West Player of the Year, senior Jenelle Hudson became just the second setter in CSULB history to earn the award. She currently leads the Big West in assists with a total of 587 and sits second in assists per set with 10.30.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Ashley Murray was also recognized for her performance in last year’s remarkable run as she was the recipient of the 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year award. Aiding Murray at the middle blocker position is Ball State transfer, senior Hayley Benson. She recently earned Big West Defensive Player of the Week after tallying seven blocks and two blocks per set in the 49ers conference opener.</p>\n<p>Despite preparing for its second and third conference games of the season, the stakes are slowly heightening for UCSB as a win could reinvigorate the Gauchos’ hopes this season.</p>\n<p>“Right now our focus is first on CSUN and then we’ll look at Long Beach as well,” Lantagne Welch said. “It comes down to the process. Let’s put together what we did well this weekend and add a little bit more to it. We have the advantage of playing at home and the students are now back, and that could have a lot of stuff go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB versus Cal State Northridge will proceed at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, Following the Gauchos’ Friday bout is their Saturday match versus No. 24 Cal State Long Beach. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/","id":5098,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5097,5096,5095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Inconsistencies Too Costly in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball opened its conference schedule with a road contest against No. 11 Hawai'i.

The Rainbow Wahine defeated UCSB 25-13, 25-14, 25-19. The beginning of Big West play symbolized a clean slate for Santa Barbara, but unfortunately the team’s losing slump extended to seven games. UCSB is now 4-8, 0-1 in conference play and were swept for the fourth time in its last five games. The Gauchos’ offensive errors served as a setback against a dominant Hawaii team. UCSB recorded a total of 17 attacking errors against the University of Hawaii’s six.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58068\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"169675182\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64882\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58068\" data-attachment-id=\"58068\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/weekend-sweep-places-ucsb-into-contention/w-volleyball-v-uc-irvine-by-eric-swenson_for-11-09-2014/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=1200%2C807&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,807\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415480609\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"W Volleyball v UC Irvine by Eric Swenson_for 11.09.2014-\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=888%2C597&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58068\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=294%2C198\" alt=\"Senior oustide hitter Ali Barbeau attempting to make a block at the net.

We did that at times, we just didn’t sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Last season marked the end of the Rainbow Wahine’s illustrious streak of 19 consecutive conference championships, a winning stretch that combined their success in both the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and Big West conferences, respectively. With this year’s pre-season prediction to earn a first-place finish in the Big West poll, it was a prominent first step for a Hawaii team that is determined to regain its conference notoriety. The Rainbow Wahine improved to 12-1 and are now 2-0 versus Big West opponents after sweeps of UCSB and Cal Poly this weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nearly 7,000 people filled Hawaii’s Stan Sheriff Center on Friday, indicating the long-awaited conference opener. Despite the daunting atmosphere, UCSB managed to hold its ground in the match’s beginning.</p>\n<p>A combination of kills, one service ace and one assisted block helped Santa Barbara go on an early 5-2 run. Still, a mentally well-equipped team like Hawaii did not panic as it rallied back with a 4-0 run of its own, taking a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s lead remained at a tight margin, but a kill by junior opposite Nikki Taylor triggered the team’s offensive surge to close the set. Up 15-12, Taylor’s attack sparked Hawaii’s 10-1 run to win the game’s first set, taking the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the one-set deficit, UCSB continued to trade points with Hawaii in the opening of the second set. Yet, tied 7-7, Santa Barbra’s inability to limit its self-inflicted mistakes contributed to the Rainbow Wahine having a match-best .452 hitting clip. Hawaii surely benefited from its attacking success as it went on two 6-0 runs, the second scoring spurt gave the Rainbow Wahine a 23-12 lead. Helping capture the 25-14 set win were two kills by junior setter Tayler Higgins and sophomore middle hitter Emily Maglio.</p>\n<p>UCSB remained motivated in its quest to trim Hawaii’s lead. While the Gauchos’ ongoing errors persisted in the match’s last set, their offense improved to a team-high .258 hitting percentage. Three different Gauchos tallied a total of six kills, while sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman led UCSB in kills for the fourth straight match with seven.</p>\n<p>Still, Hawaii’s outstanding hitting stretch continued as it registered a .433 clip. Leading the Rainbow Wahine was an imposing performance by Higgins. Last week’s espnW Player of the Week, Higgins tallied a match-high 14 kills to go along with a .464 hitting night.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii outhit UCSB, freshman libero Emilia Petrachi logged a match-high 19 digs. However, it was Santa Barbara’s insufficiency at the net that plagued its defense. While UCSB had no blocking errors, the Gauchos blocked just six of Hawaii’s attacking attempts. Not only were the Rainbow Wahine able to capitalize offensively, but they also strived on defense with a total of 19 blocks. In addition to Maglio’s eight kills and .615 hitting clip, she notched a match-high of six blocks to help Hawaii win the final set, 25-19.</p>\n<p>Certainly the Rainbow Wahines’ performance on both sides of the net must be acknowledged, but UCSB’s errors proved too costly against a powerhouse program like Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I think Hawaii is a great team. They have no real weakness and they had a huge size advantage on us,” Lantagne Welch said. “I actually thought we played better than the score indicated. If you hit .300 against just about any team you’re gonna win. We just didn’t put enough pressure on them or their offense. We didn’t serve tough at all and we let them off the hook that way.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to the Thunderdome this Friday, Oct. 2nd to host its conference home opener versus Cal State Northridge at 7:00 p.m. UCSB continues its home stand with a match versus No. 25 Long Beach State on Saturday, Oct. 3rd at 7:00 p.m. as well.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

unpredictability of college sports is an element that cannot be found elsewhere. The rush of emotions that occur while watching an underdog triumphantly upset a top team is always an achievement that is remembered.</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 11, 2013 is a date in UCSB women’s volleyball history that remains relevant. In her first year as Gaucho Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch helped lead Santa Barbara to a 3-2 upset victory over No. 5 Hawaii. This Friday is a pivotal opportunity for UCSB to recreate history in its Big West conference season opener against No. 11 Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the challenge, and obviously we need to progress this week in practice. We definitely need to get our confidence at a stronger, stable point to go into their place,” Lantagne Welch said. “There’s some eerily similar things to two years ago. We were struggling in the pre-conference and not doing so great, and we went over to the islands and upset them. We know that you gotta get out there and play the game and we’re excited to do that and it’s a great opportunity for us.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara enters Stan Sheriff Center with a 4-7 overall record, and is set to face a Hawaii team that is in full stride and on pace for a special season. The Gauchos certainly have a challenging task ahead of them as they are 0-2 versus Top 25 opponents this season. The Rainbow Wahine are currently 10-1 overall, and are hoping to extend their five-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB comes into its conference opener with a chip on its shoulder as it has yet to end its disheartening losing stretch of six games. Overcoming this frustrating streak will be no easy task as the Gauchos prepare to face one of the nation’s best players in Nikki Taylor.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine’s junior opposite is having a captivating year in which she has earned an array of awards and accolades at the season’s midpoint. Through just 11 matches, she is now Hawaii’s record setter for most Big West Player of the Week Awards after earning three straight, was rewarded Sports Imports/AVCA Division I National Player of the Week honors and became the first player in Rainbow Wahine history to receive the espnW National Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>While Taylor is having a standout year, Hawaii as a collective group has played spectacularly on the court. The Rainbow Wahine are flourishing in making their case as the Big West’s top team as they lead six of the conference’s seven statistical categories.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to spoil Hawaii’s winning record, the Gauchos’ must maintain a consistent balance on both sides of the ball. They rank second in the conference in service aces per set at 1.41, are tied for first in solo blocks with 24, third with an average of 2.32 blocks per set and are second in the league with the least amount of errors at 198.</p>\n<p>As long as Santa Barbara does not allow Hawaii to force it into playing against their strengths, the chances of UCSB upsetting the Rainbow Wahine become more realistic. The beginning of conference play presents the Gauchos with a great opportunity to disregard their early-season stumble with hopes of improvement.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a couple of rough games, but now with starting conference we get to travel to Hawaii and play a really great team. I think it’s a great time to show what we’ve got and have a new fresh start,” sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman said. “We have to go into practice with the mentality that we’re going to get better every day because you can’t just keep saying it or you’ll never improve.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s conference season-opener against No. 11 Hawaii will take place on the road this Friday, Sept. 25th at 10 p.m. PT, 7 p.m. HST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of September 24, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64793\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64793\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/","id":5317,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5316,5315,5314],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Winless Troubles Continue in Non-Conference Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Volleyball_Kenneth-Song_for-10.20.2014-1608.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Volleyball_Kenneth-Song_for-10.20.2014-1608.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's losing streak extends to six-games after losses against Loyola Marymount and San Diego.

The Gauchos are now 4-7 overall, and are hoping that the start to Big West play will be an uplifting phase of their season.</p>\n<p>It was a thrilling opening to the Gauchos’ weekend as they battled with Loyola Marymount in a five-set showdown. Able to secure the match’s last two sets, the Lions would go on to earn the 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The offensive firepower of both teams was on full display as each traded points in the game’s first set. Tied at 22-22, it was UCSB’s attack that allowed it to win the set as the Gauchos’ recorded three-consecutive kills. Aiding Santa Barbara in its closing of the set was its efficient pursuit as it had just one attacking error.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While the Gauchos’ managed to surpass LMU in the first set, the Lions’ achieved their best hitting clip of the night, a game-high of .464 in the second set. After nearly capturing the victory in the first set, Loyola Marymount did not allow the loss to linger as it opened the new set with a 7-1 run. Helping create these high-percentage attacks for LMU was the marvelous setting performance of senior Hannah Tedrow as she registered a total of 53 assists.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, its number of errors equaled its total of kills, resulting in a .000 hitting percentage. However, Santa Barbara redeemed itself by earning its best hitting-clip of the night at .364 and never allowed LMU to gain the lead during the entire third period.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s ability to gain an early lead was vital as it eventually led to the Gauchos’ largest lead of the set at a score of 19-10. The Lions’ trimmed UCSB’s lead to as low as two at a score of 22-24, but were unable to fully overcome the deficit.</p>\n<p>Down two sets to one, it was only a matter of time until LMU’s lethal trio of hitters would emerge. Led by an arsenal of players who each have more than 120 kills, the Lions’ offensive attack overwhelmed the Gauchos in the game’s last two sets.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Rachelle Suaava, outside hitters junior Jamie Lea and sophomore Sarah Sponcil combined for a total of 46 of the team’s 67 kills. Sponcil had a sensational performance as she recorded 23 kills, 10 digs, and five service aces.</p>\n<p>UCSB responded with some offense of its own as sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman led Santa Barbara in kills with 10. Balancing Santa Barbara’s attack was its exceptional play at the net. The Gauchos’ defense ended the evening with a total of 21 blocks, junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield was responsible for a match-high eight. Still, the Gauchos’ efforts were not enough as their winless streak continued and the Lions’ improved to 7-3 overall.</p>\n<p>In spite of the team’s latest winning drought, its remains with the utmost confidence. “We try to think of every game as a fresh new start,” Hoffman said. “It doesn’t matter if we lost or even won the last game, all that matters is that there is a new game ahead, and a new opportunity to bring everything we have to the court.”</p>\n<p>Concluding the Gauchos’ non-conference schedule was their Saturday bout versus San Diego State. Despite being swept 3-0, UCSB did not oblige to the Aztecs’ victory as it did not go down without another hard-fought performance in the match’s final two extra-point sets.</p>\n<p>Trailing 14-22 in the second set, Santa Barbara’s 10-2 rally helped tie the score at 24-24. A total of six lead changes would occur from that point on, but a costly UCSB service error and a timely block by SDSU’s defense resulted in the Aztecs’ 31-29 set victory.</p>\n<p>On the verge of being swept, UCSB retaliated with a commanding start of its own. It opened the third set with a 10-3 run, and seemed destined to play another set. Guiding the Gauchos’ potential comeback was Hoffman, who had a team-high 10 kills while sophomore libero Sydney Bast recorded a career-high 18 digs.</p>\n<p>But, the Gauchos’ hot streak didn’t last long as San Diego State would go on a 10-2 run of its own to take a 18-16 lead. Leading the three-time Mountain West champions was freshman outside hitter Alexandra Psoma as she finished with a match-high 12 kills. Both teams continued to swap points, but it was another Aztecs’ block by middle blockers senior Kaja Sandberg and junior Emma Fuzie that sealed the team’s 29-27 win, allowing SDSU to improve to an overall record of 3-8.</p>\n<p>Certainly the past two weekends have been frustrating for UCSB, but the Gauchos’ plan on leaving the adversity of their non-conference games in the past as they prepare for their first conference game of the season.</p>\n<p>“The big thing in our favor right now is we actually start a new season today,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “We’re moving into Big West play, and everyone is 0-0.

Through nine games, the Gauchos are 4-5 overall and are hoping to overcome their latest four-game losing skid.</p>\n<p>In her third season, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch is hoping to bounce back from a near average year in which UCSB finished 13-14 overall, 8-8 in conference.</p>\n<p>Despite its current winless streak, UCSB is a team with much potential. The Gauchos entered this season with the 18th-best recruiting class in the nation and a third-place Big West preseason ranking. For a roster with only five seniors, this season has provided the Gauchos’ younger, developing talent with much playing time.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Attempting to fill the vacancy of former Gaucho setter Ali Spindt, freshman Annie Hasselmann has held her ground. Though still adapting to the collegiate level, Hasselmann has been productive on the court with a total of 157 assists and an average of 4.76 assists per set.</p>\n<p>Helping ease the transition for Hasselmann is redshirt senior setter Hanna Nielson. Although she has statistically outperformed the young setter with 179 assists and an average of 5.42 assists per set, shet has been a great influence on Hasselmann’s growth.</p>\n<p>Turning those assists into points is the remarkable offense of senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau. UCSB’s leader on the court as a senior captain, Barbeau is on pace for another outstanding season. A two-time All-Big West First Team selection, she leads UCSB in kills with 105 and owns a team-high average of 3.18 kills per set. She has accomplished career-highs in kills (15) and digs (18) so far this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to the prolific attack provided by Barbeau is the offensive precision of another veteran player like senior opposite Britton Taylor. Behind Barbeau for the team-high in kills at 65, Taylor’s efficiency when attacking has been consistent as she has a .271 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have been solid offensively, UCSB’s defense has quietly exceeded the expectations of many. The unexpected emergence of freshman libero Emilia Petrachi as one of the Big West’s top performers has been admirable. A vital piece in the Gauchos’ playmaking defensively, Petrachi ranks second in-conference in digs per set (4.35) and fourth in total digs (135). Overall, Santa Barbara has done well defending the attack as it is second in the Big West in digs per set with 15.36.</p>\n<p>Another underrated aspect of the Gauchos’ defensive force has been its blocking. A total of 77 blocks and 2.33 blocks per set, UCSB’s defense at the net has been superb.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield have been essential to Santa Barbara’s defensive front. Both ranking top 10 in blocks per set, the duo is responsible for 70 of the team’s total blocks. They’ve been helpful on the offensive side as well as Grunt’s .284 attacking clip and Sheffield’s .341 hitting percentage rank among the top 10 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With just two non-conference games left, hope is still alive for UCSB as it has the opportunity to gain some momentum with another home-based invitational this weekend. The Gauchos will be co-hosting the UCSB/Cal Poly Tournament.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the two rivals will not face each other just yet, but Santa Barbara’s first matchup will be versus Loyola Marymount at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s home stand ends with a Saturday afternoon match against San Diego State at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article appeared on page 13 of September 17, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64665\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64665\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/","id":5151,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5150,5149,5148],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Host in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos welcome some of nation's best to the Thunderdome ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Thunderdome will be live and energetic this weekend as the UCSB women’s volleyball team prepares to host its first tournament of the 2015 season.

The driving force behind SMU’s prosperous rise is senior setter Avery Acker.</p>\n<p>A two-time All-American Honorable Mention, Acker leads the American Athletic Conference in assists per set with 11.96. She helped the Mustangs win their five-set battle versus New Mexico last Saturday with a season-high 58 assists. Her career total of 3,000 plus assists ranks her sixth all-time in SMU history.</p>\n<p>Another key counterpart to the Mustangs success is junior Morgan Heise. The 2014 American Athletic Libero of the Year, Heise set an SMU single-season record with 626 digs. The Mustangs 17.70 digs per set ties them with UCF for a conference-high this season.</p>\n<p>Expect another MVP-esque performance from senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau to combat SMU’s fierce defense. The Yale Invitational Co-MVP, Barbeau leads the Gauchos in kills with 81 and is just one dig away from being tied for second on the team at 58 after recording a career-high 18 digs against Yale.</p>\n<p>“Our serving improved, which helps our defense,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “It puts more pressure on other teams and makes it easier for our defense to set up for digs and blocks.”</p>\n<p>Next on Santa Barbara’s schedule is the University of San Diego. UCSB’s first ranked opponent, the 5-1 Toreros are also on a four-game winning run after hosting its own invitational last weekend.</p>\n<p>Leading USD in its superb home performance was redshirt junior middle blocker Lisa Kramer. She was awarded with All-Tournament honors after accumulating a total of 30 kills, 12 blocks, and a .397 hitting percentage. Kramer is currently tied for the team-lead in attacking percentage at a clip of .286.</p>\n<p>Having a breakout season for San Diego is junior middle blocker Lauren Schad. She finished last weekend with a total of 19 blocks and owns a team-high of 38. Her mastery of the block ranks her at the top of the West Coast Conference as she averages 1.68 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>Securing the net for the Gauchos are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield. Grunt’s 6’4” stature along with Sheffield’s vertical bounce have complimented each other well so far this year. The two have combined for a total of 48 blocks this season.</p>\n<p>Since losing last week’s tournament finale to Rhode Island, UCSB has been more proactive in preparing for its upcoming matches.</p>\n<p>“We really pinpointed certain things that we need to work on to make sure that we don’t make the same errors again,” Sheffield said. “We’re going to make sure that we figure out what those teams are really good at doing and make sure that we can shut it down.”</p>\n<p>Ending the Gauchos’ home debut is a contest versus UCLA. The Bruins’ come into UCSB with a 4-1 overall record and are on a three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>As one of eight nationally ranked teams from a talented Pac-12 Conference, UCLA will be no easy exit for the Gauchos. A transfer from West Virginia this offseason, junior outside hitter Jordan Anderson has been an absolute stud in her first season as a Bruin. Her efficiency when attacking has been valuable to UCLA’s offense as she ranks third in the Pac-12 in kills per set averaging 4.38.</p>\n<p>UCSB definitely has its work cut out for itself this weekend. Some may consider UCSB to be the underdog even on home territory, but should not be underestimated when playing in the Thunderdome as the possibility of an upset awaits.</p>\n<p>UCSB starts its invitational tomorrow, Sept. 11<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m. versus SMU. Followed by a Saturday match versus No. 18 USD at 4 p.m., and a Sunday bout versus No. 17 UCLA at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/","id":4988,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4987,4986,4985],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":13,"route":"/categories/sports/volleyball","highestPage":32}},"__N_SSG":true}
