Down 4-2 early in the first set, UCSB rallied and ran away from the Lancers, closing the set out on a 13-3 run and racking up 13 kills against zero errors.</p>\n<p>In the second set, however, things were not nearly as clean or easy for the Gauchos. The Lancers, 2-5 overall and 1-3 in conference, opened up with a 4-0 run, forcing McLaughlin to call timeout right out of the gate.</p>\n<p>Three straight kills from star outside hitter Jacob Delson closed the gap, but it wasn’t until another Delson kill 27 points deep into the set that UCSB finally took a lead. That lead held for the rest of the set, but the Gauchos were never quite able to shake Cal Baptist off.</p>\n<p>Three straight kills from star outside hitter Jacob Delson closed the gap, but it wasn’t until another Delson kill 27 points deep into the set that UCSB finally took a lead. That lead held for the rest of the set, but the Gauchos were never quite able to shake Cal Baptist off.</p>\n<p>“Winning a [set] and then coming out there lax for the second [set], that’s what we’ve got to stop doing,” McLaughlin said. “It’s going to bite us at some point.”</p>\n<p>The Lancers came out hot again in the third set, but the Gauchos managed to assert their authority much quicker this time around. A general pattern of two points for UCSB, one point for Cal Baptist pushed the Gauchos out into a healthy 15-10 lead, which turned into a final tally of 25-16.</p>\n<p>Delson was, unsurprisingly, UCSB’s leading hitter Friday night with 15 kills, but it was his passing that really shone. The redshirt senior, along with brothers Parker (red shirt senior libero) and Hayden Boehle (junior outside hitter), drew praise from McLaughlin for their success in keeping the offense flowing.</p>\n<p>“I thought the three passers played great,” McLaughlin said. “[Delson] has playing great every night out, and he’s really leading us.”</p>\n<p>The strong work from the passing trio held the Lancers to only one ace on the night, while UCSB racked up five of their own. Redshirt sophomore middle blocker Henri Cherry led the Gauchos with two, while freshman middle blocker Keenan Sanders, Hayden Boehle and senior setter Grady Zant each had one of their own.</p>\n<p>Up next for UCSB is second-ranked UCLA in Westwood on Wednesday night at 7 p.m., the Gauchos’ first road game of this young season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/","id":5006,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5005,5004,5003],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 12 UCSB Prepares for Battle Against Trojans","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-11-MensVball-UCI-EricSwensonNexus-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-11-MensVball-UCI-EricSwensonNexus-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After earning its first MPSF victory of the season over the weekend, the No. 12 UCSB men's volleyball team will remain at home to host the University of Southern California Wednesday night.

Two of those ranked teams are in the top five in the country — Ohio State at No. 1 and Long Beach State at No. 4 —while the other two were in the remaining half of the rankings in No. 14 Cal State Northridge and No. 15 Penn State.</p>\n<p>However, USC’s current record doesn’t tell the full story and neither does its most recent loss. The Trojans lost the first two sets of that match by a combined nine points, and they stayed tight to the Matadors’ heels throughout. A few more breaks for USC and Saturday’s outcome might have been very different.</p>\n<p>Senior Lucas Yoder, a 6’5” outside hitter, emerged as USC’s most potent offensive force last season with a team-high 273 kills, and he’s shown no signs of falling off this season. Yoder once again leads his squad in kills with 104, 68 more than the next Trojan player.</p>\n<p>More often than not, junior setter Gert Lisha has been the one assisting Yoder on those kills. Lisha has 207 assists so far this year, for an average of 10.35 per set, and has been a vital cog in the Trojans’ offensive machine.</p>\n<p>As a team, USC is hitting at a rate of about 28 percent, far below the Gauchos’ 34 percent rate. That low percentage has been at the root of some of the Trojans’ problems so far this year, and it could very well serve as a key to a possible UCSB victory on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>USC’s rather one-dimensional offense provides another opportunity for the Gauchos to focus on. Shut down Yoder and the Trojans don’t have a proven second option to turn to. Still, no team, not even the first-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, have been able to shut down Yoder.</p>\n<p>If UCSB follows suit and finds itself unable to silence Yoder, the Gauchos will just have to outperform him as a collective. Led by redshirt senior outside hitter Jacob Delson, junior outside hitter/libero Hayden Boehle, redshirt sophomore middle blocker Henri Cherry and emerging freshman middle blocker Keenan Sanders, the Gauchos have the firepower to do so.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need strong performances from that quartet, as well as from freshman setter Casey McGarry, to join the already swollen ranks of top-15 teams to have beaten the weathered Trojans. The two teams meet this Wednesday, Jan. 18 in Rob Gym at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74883\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/no-12-ucsb-prepares-for-battle-against-trojans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74883\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/no-12-ucsb-prepares-for-battle-against-trojans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/no-12-ucsb-prepares-for-battle-against-trojans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/no-12-ucsb-prepares-for-battle-against-trojans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/no-12-ucsb-prepares-for-battle-against-trojans/","id":5005,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5004,5003,5002],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 12 UCSB In Search of First MPSF Victory at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 12 UCSB men's volleyball team has yet to pick up an MPSF win, but has a chance to against UCSD, who is winless in conference matches thus far.

UC Irvine trampled UCSD earlier in the month, while Grand Canyon came in to San Diego and left with a 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>Those two losses came despite the best efforts of freshman Devin Pontigon, who led his team in kills both matches, and has posted a sterling 3.86 points per set so far this year. Pontigon will be the focus of much of the Gauchos’ defense on Friday, although upperclassmen Ian Colbert (a senior with a team-high three aces) and Tanner Syftestad (a junior who’s second on the team with 12 kills) will attract some serious attention as well.</p>\n<p>Junior setter Milosh Stojcic has done an excellent job in setting up the Triton offense in UCSD’s first two games, posting 63 assists at a sturdy clip of nine assists per set.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Casey McGarry isn’t too far behind Stojcic in that department. The freshman has 8.50 assists per set of his own, and a team-high 119 assists. Toss in fellow freshman Randy DeWeese, averaging seven assists per set himself, and the Gauchos have a young setter stew going.</p>\n<p>Both McGarry and DeWeese will be crucial to the rebound effort on Friday. UCSB’s big hitters, including redshirt senior Jacob Delson, junior Hayden Boehle and redshirt sophomore Henri Cherry, are all reliant on their setters to keep the offense flowing and the Gauchos winning.</p>\n<p>Delson holds a commanding lead in the UCSB kills department with 68, 22 more than Boehle, his closest teammate. Delson’s doing it at a better rate than even Pontigon is for UCSD, racking up 4.25 kills per set in four games.</p>\n<p>If UCSB wants to rebound from Wednesday’s tough loss, it’s going to need strong performances from everybody on the offensive chain. The Gauchos proved they can hang with some of the highest ranked teams in the nation on Wednesday, but now they need to show that they can take a defeat from one of those teams and keep on ticking.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UCSD on Friday night, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. at Robertson Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/","id":5004,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5003,5002,5001],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season in Review: Women’s Volleyball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_012-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_012-web.jpg?resize=480%2C600&ssl=1","description":"In a season that started with a promising beginning but experienced its inconsistencies, the UCSB women's volleyball team still managed to avenge last year's losing finish.

They began a stretch of six wins in seven nights, their only loss at the hands of Long Beach State in a grueling five sets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exciting run gave the Gauchos a legitimate shot at the postseason, though it was squandered when a second matchup with UC Riverside ended exactly like the first, in a mystifying loss for UCSB. Riverside finished second to last in the conference with a 3-13 record, making the season crushing loss even more confusing for the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the wind taken out of their sails, the Gauchos were still presented with an opportunity to reclaim a spot in the NCAA postseason. A win against the nationally ranked Hawaii Rainbow Wahine would have given UCSB an inside track to the playoffs, but the Gauchos weren’t able to overcome the Big West Champions, dashing their postseason hopes once and for all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB concluded its season against UC Irvine, but the group appeared depleted from the two previous devastating losses, never showing much fight and getting swept by the Anteaters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the Gauchos will fall short of their preseason playoff goals, the plethora of young talent on this UCSB team is unmistakable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a big group of returners which is certainly exciting for this group,” Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, noted. “We have a group of young women that have high goals and aspirations for where they want to take this program.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First among those young women is redshirt first-year outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, who after putting up season averages of 4.09 kills per set, a .246 hitting percentage, 2.08 digs per set and 0.31 service aces per set, was named Big West Freshman of the Year. Ruddins also earned a spot on the All Big West First Team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She will play a pivotal role on the team moving forward, and the Gauchos will need Ruddins to build off her fantastic first year and continue developing into possibly the Big West’s most potent outside hitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lindsey was a big time point scorer for us this year,” Coach Lantagne Welch, said. “I can only see that [improving from here].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lantagne Welch continued, “[Lindsey] had one of her best matches at Hawaii against some of the top competition in the country. I know she can grow in certain areas, [such as] being really effective on back to back nights.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruddins success is exciting for the Gauchos’ future, as Coach Lantagne Welch explained how much room the redshirt first-year has to grow. “[Lindsey] has so much room to improve still. She started taking on a bigger roll passing towards the end of the year, and that’s something she’ll want to grow with and get better at, along with her defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside Ruddins on the Big West All-Freshman team was fellow Gaucho freshman middle blocker/right side hitter Rowan Ennis, who started all nine conference matches and finished the Big West schedule with 2.29 kills per set on a .253 hitting percentage. She, too, will play a vital role in the Gauchos’ offense moving forward after showing that she was more than prepared for the collegiate stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite another season ending injury, junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman still received an Honorable Mention for the All-Conference team, and for now, she’ll enter next season as the only senior on the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Elizabeth Sheffield also received an Honorable Mention for the All-Conference team, a heart-warming development for the middle blocker who spent her first two collegiate seasons with the UCSB club program before joining the team last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have many other cornerstones to build upon for 2017. Sophomore Emilia Petrachi was the most productive libero in the conference, and redshirt freshamn Hannah Juley proved herself as a permanent option at the setter position for UCSB for the next three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know our culture and team chemistry is excellent,” Lantagne Welch concluded. “We made a lot of strides in the right direction this year, and we gained a lot of experience. Now it’s just going to be using that experience to get better and grow as players.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end of the season begins the process for next year, as the Gauchos will look to build off their improvements this year to become one of the premier teams in the Big West in 2017.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/","id":5003,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5002,5001,5000],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Unable to Overcome Slump, Swept in Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"An end to its five match winning streak last week signaled a downward shift in the UCSB women's basketball team's 2016 season as the Gauchos ended their season on a three-match losing streak after bei...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team concluded its season on the eve of Thanksgiving, losing its third straight match in a 3-0 sweep to UC Irvine.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65227\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65227\" data-attachment-id=\"65227\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/emilia-petrachi-bump-sets-the-ball-to-her-teammate-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Emilia Petrachi bump-sets the ball to her teammate.

After playing to a 13-13 tie, two kills from redshirt junior middle blocker Danielle Geiger and an attack error from UCSB freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen gave Irvine a 16-13 lead.</p>\n<p>Though the Gauchos continued to battle, that distance proved sufficient for the Anteaters, who held the lead for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>UCSB was again able to keep it close through the beginning of the second frame, though the train went off the rails a bit earlier for the Gauchos in this one. After achieving a seven-point tie, UCSB lost the lead, never to gain it again, falling 19-25 to the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>The third set was the Gauchos’ best showing, as if they’d realized the end of their season was staring them directly in the face.</p>\n<p>Playing with an increased sense of urgency, the Gauchos were able to extend their close play with UC Irvine far past their earlier watermarks, even taking a 20-19 lead into the final stretch of the set. Two kills from sophomore opposite hitter Harlee Kekauoha and one from freshman outside hitter Loryn Carter gave the Anteaters the lead, however, and the Gauchos were unable to get it back, losing 25-23.</p>\n<p>A disappointing season’s end for the Gauchos, the team’s inconsistencies mounted after having successive blows dealt to their postseason chances over the past two matches. Losing to UC Riverside put the Gauchos on the outside looking in, and last Saturday’s loss to Hawaii relieved UCSB of all playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield was the only Gaucho to top double-digit kills in the match, finishing with an even 10 in the final exhibition of her career. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins could only muster nine kills on 31 attempts, finishing with a .194 hitting percentage, far below her usual output.</p>\n<p>Sheffield’s fellow senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt finished with six kills on 11 attempts for the Gauchos, while Chloe Allen was able to add eight of her own. Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley finished with 30 assists, right in line with her conference average of 10.21 per set.</p>\n<p>Juley was outpaced by UC Irvine senior setter Shelley Anderson, however, who finished with 37 assists on the night while also contributing eight digs over the three sets.</p>\n<p>Two Anteaters finished with at least 10 kills; Loryn Carter collected 11 and redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis racked up 10 of her own. Four other players finished with at least five kills, contributing to the all-around approach that caused the Gaucho’s demise on the evening.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi was her usual self for the Gauchos, finishing with 13 digs (4.33 per set), far outdoing the Anteaters’ junior libero Luna Tsujimoto, who reached only six.</p>\n<p>Though this was not the way the Gauchos wanted to end the season, the year was beyond a doubt a productive one. UCSB was able to establish itself as an up-and-coming young team, with several of its best players returning next season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/","id":5002,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5001,5000,4999],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope To End Season On a High Note","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has improved mightily this season and even though there will be no NCAA appearance, it hopes to end the season with a win.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absent any postseason hope, the UCSB women’s volleyball team will aim to finish their conference schedule with a positive record Wednesday night in a home match against the UC Irvine Anteaters (11-18, 6-9 Big West).</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65793\" style=\"width: 295px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65793\" data-attachment-id=\"65793\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/elizabeth-sheffield-takes-a-swing-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Elizabeth Sheffield takes a swing.

Junior libero Luna Tsujimoto is one of seven Big West players to average at least four digs per set in conference play; her mark of 4.28 per set is about a half dig shy of Gaucho sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi’s 4.71 league-leading number. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this will surely be UCSB’s final match of the year, there are still many bright spots in what was a vastly improved season for the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lindsey Ruddins will wrap up a tremendously successful conference schedule in which she averaged 3.83 kills per set (fifth in the Big West), .56 service aces per set (second), 2.06 digs per set (28th) and 4.5 points per set (third). If she can top 20 kills in the contest, it would be her third time in four matches and fifth this season. After missing out on the 2015 season, Ruddins has proved to be every bit as good as billed in 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After transferring from Wisconsin, Hannah Juley, too, was an absolute standout for the Gauchos in 2016. Finishing with the fifth-most assists per set amongst her Big West competition, Juley hit her stride when the conference schedule started. Since then she’s accumulated five double-doubles, eight matches with at least 40 assists and two with at least 50. A key concern this season for the Gauchos was locking down the setter position, and Juley has left no question about the direction for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB can also rest easy knowing it has possibly the Big West’s best libero in Petrachi. The sophomore from Modena, Italy leads the conference in digs per set and comes into the match with four straight 20-dig efforts after only five up to that point in the year.

Hawaii found an early lead behind two service aces from senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor, and was able to control the early portion of the set, eventually leading 17-11.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">A timeout from Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch would make all the difference, however, as the Gauchos would follow the stoppage with a 14-4 run to win the set.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The final push, an 8-1 drubbing of the Rainbow Wahine, was spearheaded by the service work of outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins; the redshirt freshman had two service aces over the stretch, as well as an assist to redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley, who would rack up assists of her own on half of UCSB’s final eight points.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen would also collect three kills over the stretch, finishing with 10 in the match, good for second most on the Gauchos and her third-highest output for the season.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB played the Rainbow Wahine to a 6-3 advantage in the second set, a peak in the Gauchos’ hopes for the evening. An eight-point Hawaii run would follow, and UCSB never posed much of a threat for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The third frame saw a similar effort from the Gauchos to begin the set, but another devastating 10-2 Hawaii run midway through, pushing the lead to 20-13, was again UCSB’s downfall.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The Gauchos weren’t able to put up much of a fight in the fourth game, never holding a lead on the way to finishing with only 10 points</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB was held to hitting percentages of -.031, .159 and .000 in the final three sets, starkly contrasting with the .323, .304, and .400 marks achieved by the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Lindsey Ruddins was still very productive for the Gauchos, accumulating 21 kills, albeit on a whopping 68 attempts (.235 kill percentage), along with three service aces and six digs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">She fell just short of Hawaii’s Nikki Taylor, who concluded Saturday’s match with a double-double on 22 kills (.405 kill percentage) and 11 digs, adding three service aces for good measure.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Hawaii hasn’t lost since an overtime match with Long Beach State on Oct. 8, and it dominated the last match against UCSB in straight sets, 25-20, 25-14, 25-19. The Rainbow Wahine have only dropped one set since the LBSU match and have now swept seven straight league opponents, including that same 49ers team two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Rainbow Wahine senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor has been one of the league’s premier scorers this season, racking up 4 kills per set in conference play. She’s aided by sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato and middle hitters senior Annie Mitchem and junior Emily Maglio, each of whom rank in the top 25 for kills per set against Big West competition with at least 2.20.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Maglio paces all players with a .409 kill percentage against conference competition, as she’s been good for 100 kills and only 17 errors over the span. Mitchem also ranks fourth with a .353 hitting percentage, completing what has been a ferociously efficient duo in the middle for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos, Hawaii also relies on first-year setter Norene Iosia. UCSB’s redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley and Iosia have put up very similar stats through their respective Big West schedules, as Iosia barely trails Juley’s mark of 10.35 assists per set with 10.20 of her own.</p>\n<p>Iosia is coming off double-doubles in her last two matches, with 33 assists and 12 digs against UC Davis following a 28 assist and 11 dig effort against UC Irvine,</p>\n<p>Hawaii is one of two teams in the Big West without a player averaging four digs per set in conference play, though junior libero Savanah Kahakai’s 3.96 figure is just shy of the mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi and every one of her 4.59 digs per set against Big West foes Saturday, as she presents a situation where UCSB may have a talent advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue to ride the offensive shockwaves of their redshirt first-years Lindsey Ruddins and Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>Ruddins has been seventh-best in kills per set during Big West play, averaging 3.70. While she was relatively shut down with 12 kills in the match against UC Riverside, Ruddins had 27 kills in a monster outing against Cal State Fullerton the night before, showing just how deadly she can be.</p>\n<p>Juley had 94 assists over this past weekend, 47 in each match, and will have to be on her A-game for the Gauchos to have a shot against the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>She’s been on an upward trajectory throughout the year, a trend that will need to continue for the first-year if UCSB is to have any hope of their postseason dreams becoming reality.</p>\n<p>Mindset will be important for the Gauchos heading into the final two matches. With their playoff hopes lingering in uncertainty, intensity is a focus for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We can go into this with absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “An aggressive mindset is absolutely what we need.”</p>\n<p>Relating to gains throughout their season, UCSB’s best weekends this year have come after stretches of great practices, a trend that was shaken last week.</p>\n<p>“Over the last month, every week we’ve had great practices except for last week,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “They know that, they recognize that and they realize how important that is and how much it carries over to the games. The key is that we just stay confident.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and maintain that confidence and defeat a Hawaii team that has appeared, at times, unbeatable.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to breathe some fire back into their season on Saturday night, facing off against Hawaii at 9 p.m. Pacific time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November, 17 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCR ended its two-game skid with the victory over UCSB and currently sits at 8-18 and 3-11 in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB dropped its first match against the Highlanders on Oct. 14 in four sets, and Saturday’s rematch proved to be even more competitive with Riverside winning in a fifth set 23-25, 25-21, 9-25, 25-21, 15-11.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The disappointing outcome came on the heels of a fifth-straight victory for UCSB after defeating Cal State Fullerton. Cal State Fullerton proved to be a worthy opponent despite their 1-11 Big West record (6-20 overall) entering the match, outlasting the Gauchos 27-25 in the first set.</p>\n<p>UCSB was taking no part in a close contest for the rest of the match, however, as a 10-point run to start the second set led to the Gauchos holding the Titans under 18 in each of the final three games.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense was immaculate in those three sets, as Cal State Fullerton wasn’t able to hit above .185, plummeting in the third set with a -.077 kill percentage and seven errors. UCSB’s offense also steadily improved throughout the match, peaking in the final set when it hit .387 with only two errors.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins was in spectacular form throughout the evening, compiling 27 kills with only four errors, a .411 kill percentage and 15 digs, completing yet another double-double. A career-high in kills for the outside hitter, Ruddins also provided five service aces and was by far the most dominant player on the court.</p>\n<p>She was aided heavily by fellow redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley, who also contributed a double-double with 14 digs and a match-high 47 assists. Juley was also feeling it from the service line, joining Ruddins and redshirt sophomore Sydney Bast as the three Gaucho players with at least three aces.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi topped 20 digs for the second-straight match, finishing with 21 on the evening and providing the defensive spark that allowed the Gauchos to dominate after a shaky first set.</p>\n<p>Sophomores outside hitter Madeline Schneider, middle blocker Summer Kerins and outside hitter Shimen Fayad each had at least eight kills for the Titans, though Fayad was the only player to breach double-digits with 13.</p>\n<p>Fayad was able to notch a double-double as well with 11 digs, second most on the team to first-year defensive specialist Madisen Babich’s 16. Freshman setter Rachel Hall was also impressive throughout, her 37 assists good for just under 10 per set.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos riding a tremendous hot streak, heading into their match versus UC Riverside appeared an easy task for the ascending Gauchos as UCR is second to last in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>UCSB would take a close opening set 25-23, a late Riverside run giving the Gauchos their first scare of the night, as they had held the fellow UC at a comfortable distance for most of the game. The Highlanders controlled the second, though a late 7-2 run from the Gauchos, including two of first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s eight kills, brought UCSB within two.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside had little trouble finishing the job, however, as two kills from junior middle blocker Meg Graham contributed to a comfortable second-set Highlander victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to turn the corner in the third, playing one of their best sets of the season on the way to a 25-9 win. UCSB hit .400 in the game, compared to a -.172 for the Highlanders, and forced 10 turnovers while limiting itself to only one.</p>\n<p>After gaining a 15-11 advantage in the fourth, a six-point Riverside run proved sufficient to force a fifth set. They carried their momentum into the tie-breaker, grabbing an early 9-5 lead before a quick four-point retort from the Gauchos locked the teams in yet another draw.</p>\n<p>A 6-2 run by the Highlanders clinched the match as the Gauchos fell just short and dropped to two games behind Cal Poly for third place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Emilia Petrachi again paced the Gauchos with 21 digs, her third-straight match with 20-plus. Lindsey Ruddins, Megan Rice, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt, senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen all had at least eight kills, though Allen’s hitting percentage of .242 was the highest of the bunch, as errors were a steady issue for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley had 47 digs for the second-straight match, eight more than UC Riverside’s sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle. Doyle completed a double-double with 14 digs, and was one of four Highlanders with at least 13.</p>\n<p>One of those four was senior outside hitter Cristina Maietta, whose 14 digs, 17 kills and two aces accounted for a large portion of her team’s production. Four UCR players also had at least 10 kills, including middle blockers Meg Graham and junior Brooke Callahan, as well as first-year outside hitter Mickayla Sherman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ postseason hopes took a major hit this weekend, but the team will still try to finish the season on a positive note with its final two matches next week.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to Hawaii Saturday, Nov.13 for its second match against the Rainbow Wahine before hosting UC Irvine Wednesday, Nov. 23 for the final match of the 2016 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74177\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74177\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/","id":4995,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4994,4993,4992],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Peaking Towards Season’s Ending, at Home for Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the opportunity to extend its current four-match win streak on home soil, the UCSB women's volleyball team will play host to Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside this weekend.

The Gauchos will have to look out for her on the serve, too, as her 0.36 service aces per set are good for fourth in conference play.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Senior libero Maddie Hubbell leads her team on the defensive end of the court, ranking sixth in Big West play in digs with 4.11 per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">The Gauchos continue to rely heavily on the offensive prowess of redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins who holds sixth place in the conference in kills per set against conference opponents with 3.54. She’s coming off 31 kills in last weekend’s matches, and the Gauchos will need a similar effort from Ruddins to keep their winning streak alive.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Ruddins’s stellar weekend performance resulted in her earning her fifth Big West Freshman of the Week honor on Monday. Along with redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley receiving the accolade last week, it is now three consecutive weeks in which a Gaucho has been selected for the weekly conference award.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi has upheld the core of the UCSB defense, contributing 4.53 digs per set and leading the team to three game sweeps in two of its last three matches.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Producing at the net has been senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield, who has recently emerged for the Gauchos, registering 23 kills and seven blocks on the weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">The setter position was an inconsistent area for the Gauchos last season, but this year Juley has taken hold of the spot and remains helpful throughout the team’s rotations. She’s averaged 10.33 assists per set against conference play and piled up 77 assists over last weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">If UCSB can win these next two matches, that will be six straight for the Gauchos, and they may well take third place in the Big West from Cal Poly.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">UCSB will host Cal State Fullerton on Friday, Nov. 11, while UC Riverside will make the trip to the Central Coast to face the Gauchos on Saturday, Nov. 12. Both matches are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/","id":4993,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4992,4991,4990],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Winners in Four Straight, Sweeps UCD & UCI Over Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winners in five of its last six matches, the UCSB women's volleyball team has now won four consecutive matches after defeating UC Davis and UC Irvine over the weekend.

Their .029 hitting percentage looked even worse against the Aggies’ .400 mark, and they would go on to lose by 10 points despite first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s four kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos got out to an early lead, a 6-1 Davis run would put the Gauchos in a 9-12 hole, and they weren’t able to close the gap under two for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>Facing an end to their recent hot streak, the Gauchos launched their comeback in the third set when an 8-9 deficit became a 16-9 lead, aided by seven straight Ruddins serves.</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Annie Hasselmann started the run with a kill on an assist by redshirt sophomore defensive specialist Sydney Bast, followed by senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Hasselmann contributing a block to further shift the tide.</p>\n<p>A Ruddins service ace pushed the lead to two, tying the second highest lead to that point in the set, and a kill from Elizabeth Sheffield resulted in a UC Davis timeout.</p>\n<p>They would find no help in the respite, however, as an attack error from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom, followed by two Ruddins service aces and another Sheffield kill, capped the stretch at 16-9 UCSB, a buffer that would extend throughout the set.</p>\n<p>UC Davis would not go down easily in the fourth set, as three kills from first-year outside hitter Lauren Matias contributed to a five-point run that would tie the game at 12.</p>\n<p>Despite the burst, UCSB would never trail again, as a continuous back-and-forth culminated with two kills from first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen and a 25-23 Gaucho victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB controlled the tiebreaker, hitting a whopping .538 and winning 15-6, as after the Aggies took a 2-0 lead to start, a 12-3 run by the Gauchos would essentially seal the match.</p>\n<p>The comeback from a two-set deficit was enabled by a career evening from outside hitter Chloe Allen, whose 19 kills, .394 hitting percentage, six digs and two block assists were massive for the Gauchos, especially as junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman went down with an injury in last week’s match against Cal Poly and was unable to play against Davis.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Elizabeth Sheffield were also both rocking on the offensive end with 16 and 14 kills respectively. Ruddins added three service aces as well as 10 digs to give herself a double-double, and Sheffield continued her consistent efficiency, hitting .481 on the night.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley led the match with 40 assists and completed a double-double of her own with 11 digs, extending her streak of outstanding play that has coincided with the Gauchos’ recent run.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had five players finish with at least eight kills, paced by senior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht with 11. Their setters, sophomore Maddie Merlino and senior Sophia Mar, combined for 43 assists, as the two setters’ attack potency was on full display Thursday night.</p>\n<p>UC Davis outside hitters first-year Lauren Matias and sophomore Emily Allen collected 11 digs each, completing double-doubles with their kills, and Sophia Mar’s 11 digs also gave her a double-double for the match.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match with UC Irvine was substantially less dramatic, exemplified by the Gauchos outhitting the Anteaters by at least .050 in each of the three sets.</p>\n<p>The first set was the match’s closest, as despite holding a three-to-four-point lead for the majority of the frame, the Anteaters were able to get a couple big scores and pull within two when faced with game point 24-20.</p>\n<p>An attack error on senior setter Shelley Anderson would seal their fate, however, as UC Irvine couldn’t capitalize on what would be their high watermark of the evening.</p>\n<p>The second and final sets would play out similarly to one another, as both began with decent competition between the two teams; they were tied at 11 in the second, and the Gauchos held an 11-10 run in the third.</p>\n<p>Massive runs in each game by the Gauchos would follow in each set, however, and neither featured any substantial late-set drama.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was huge for the Gauchos in this one, with 15 kills, eight service aces and nine digs, almost completing a triple-double. Megan Rice, Chloe Allen, Elizabeth Sheffield and senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt would all assist her offensively, chipping in at least seven kills apiece.</p>\n<p>Libero Emilia Petrachi turned in a brilliant performance with 20 digs (6.67 digs per set), and set the tone for what was an unstoppable Gaucho defense. Sheffield assisted in three blocks, and Hannah Juley and Sydney Bast added seven and 11 digs respectively.</p>\n<p>No one on UC Irvine was able to amass double-digit kills, though junior libero Luna Tsujimoto led the match with 22 digs.</p>\n<p>Setter Shelley Anderson was also potent for the Anteaters, her 27 assists a team high and second in the match only to UCSB’s Hannah Juley, who finished with 10 more.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and push their winning streak to five next weekend at home, with Friday and Saturday matches against Cal state Fullerton and UC Riverside, respectively.

She stands at fourth in the conference in digs per set against Big West foes with 4.24.</p>\n<p>The engine of their offense is powered by senior setter Sophia Mar and sophomore Maddie Merlino, who have put up 6.24 assists per set and 5.73 assists per set, respectively, against Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Their two pronged attack will be an adjustment for the Gauchos, as they’ve played against one setter for their past three matches.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine has similarly won three of its past five matches. The differences between the two teams, however, include Irvine’s ability to come away with at least one set against Hawaii and fortune to hand Long Beach State its first loss of the season in five sets.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters will try and rebound from a devastating loss in their final match last weekend against Cal State Northridge after having been ahead by two sets.</p>\n<p>Clearly a team with considerable upside after their recent results, Irvine has relied on redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis and sophomore opposite hitter Harlee Kekauoha against conference competition, as the duo has averaged 3.43 and 2.82 kills per set respectively.</p>\n<p>Kekauoha also leads the Big West with .64 service aces per set in conference play. She has a total of 11 total service aces thus far this season.</p>\n<p>Senior setter Shelley Anderson greases the wheels for the Anteaters, contributing 10.22 assists per set, the fifth most prolific mark against Big West teams this season.</p>\n<p>The defensive effort is centered around junior libero Luna Tsujimoto, whose 4.15 digs per set place her just behind Davis’s Malia Bolko in the conference. First-year middle blocker Makayla Wolfe adds 1.42 blocks per set, the only non-Hawaii player in the stats top four during the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>This weekend the Gauchos will rely heavily on sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi, who has consistently made her case as the league’s best defender and continues to lead the Big West with 4.62 digs per set when matched up with conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley will look to continue her ascent as her stellar play has begun to receive recognition; she was named Big West Freshman of the Week after her dominant outing in San Luis Obispo this past weekend, and her 10.49 assists per set still rank third in Big West play.</p>\n<p>The offense will continue to be driven by redshirt first-year Lindsey Ruddins, who has dominated with 3.44 kills per set in conference play, and junior Chanel Hoffman (3.19 kills per set in conference), who has been the keystone for UCSB’s season thus far.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blockers Elizabeth Sheffield and Phoebe Grunt will look to continue a hot streak of play where opponents have had major difficulties attacking the Gauchos at the net.</p>\n<p>Winners of two straight and riding a wave of excellent play, the Gauchos are poised to assert themselves as postseason threats in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match with the Aggies will be at 7 p.m. on Nov. 3 in Davis, after which they will get a day of rest. The Gauchos then travel to Irvine for Saturday’s 7 p.m. match with the Anteaters on Nov. 5.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November, 3 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73706\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73706\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/","id":5452,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5451,5450,5449],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Season Series vs. Mustangs, Earns Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With one match on its schedule last week, the UCSB women's volleyball team was able to avoid a season sweep by its Blue-Green rival Cal Poly with a 3-0 victory over the Mustangs.

Though talented, the team appears to be closer to the Santa Barbara, Davis, Irvine echelon than to the upper registers of the conference inhabited by Long Beach and Hawaii.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB controlled the opening set, holding the Mustangs to a -.033 hitting percentage with eight errors and only seven kills, while hitting a solid .300 as a team.</p>\n<p>The match began with a defining 8-1 run, including kills from freshman redshirt outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins and senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield, both of whom also contributed to blocking one of Mustang junior middle blocker Savannah Niemen’s attack during the outburst.</p>\n<p>Ruddins added two service aces in the set and ended with six kills including the game winner. Freshman redshirt setter Hannah Juley was her usual self, accumulating 10 assists in the first frame, right in line with her current average of 10.49 per set in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The second go was much tighter between the rivals, with four lead changes preceding a kill from junior outside hitter Raeanne Greisen to reach Cal Poly’s high water mark in the set, a 10-8 lead.</p>\n<p>A string of two Mustang service errors and two attack errors swung the score back into UCSB’s favor, a lead they would not relinquish for the rest of the set. Errors would be a thorn in the side of this Cal Poly team, as they went on to commit 11 in the set and 25 in the match, 10 more than UCSB’s total.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt put the team on her back in the set with four kills, including the game clincher, three of which were assisted by Juley.</p>\n<p>Griesen tried her best to keep the Mustangs in the set, piling up seven kills and contributing heavily to a late 7-1 run that would tie the set. A block from junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman and Sheffield followed by Grunt’s kill would seal the second frame for the Gauchos, however, putting the Gauchos in position to fulfill their first three-set sweep in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game strong with Sheffield and Juley starting the scoring with a shared block, followed by a Sheffield kill assisted by Juley.</p>\n<p>After a four point run, including back-to-back kills from Greisen, gave the Mustangs the lead, UCSB would play from a two to five point deficit until the final moments of the set.</p>\n<p>Down 20-23, the Gauchos found themselves in what has been a familiar position as of late: performers of two outstanding opening sets, but incapable of completing a sweep. The result was a heartbreaking comeback for Long Beach last weekend, and an unnecessarily late challenge from Cal State Northridge in the following match.</p>\n<p>Greisen brought her team to the brink with a kill assisted by junior setter Taylor Nelson, but this time around, UCSB was not to be denied.</p>\n<p>With Juley serving, the Gauchos would ride her endgame heroics to the tune of six straight points.</p>\n<p>First came a Grunt kill on an assist by Juley, who followed by setting up freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen for her fifth kill of the set. Allen only played in the one game, but was instrumental in the Gauchos’ offensive firepower to close the match.</p>\n<p>Following Allen’s kill, Juley was at it again with back-to-back service aces that tied the score at 24 apiece. Another Juley serve would eventually result in an attack error for sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden, giving the Gauchos an opportunity for their first conference sweep of the season.</p>\n<p>Juley would strike again, as her fifth consecutive serve would lead to a kill from freshman outside hitter Megan Rice, once again on her own assist.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would have three players finish with double-digit points, led by Ruddins who finished with a double-double on 10 kills and 10 digs, not to mention two block assists and two service aces.</p>\n<p>Seniors Grunt and Sheffield would also finish with 10 and 13 points, respectively, totaling seven kills each. Sheffield was also a monster on defense near the net with eight assisted blocks.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi racked up 15 digs, slightly above her conference average of 4.62 per set.</p>\n<p>Juley was the star of the match, though, as her 31 assists, two service aces, 11 digs, five block assists and two kills on five attempts proved her ubiquity throughout the evening.</p>\n<p>Greisen was unstoppable for the Mustangs, killing 15 attacks, though the Gauchos did a good job of limiting Van Winden (fifth in Big West with 3.80 kills), as she was held to a .069 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Katherine Brouker led the match with 16 kills as she maintained her position as one of the best liberos in the Big West and improved her digs per set to 4.34, third in Big West conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finally sit at 5-5 in the conference and will look to continue their excellent streak of play next weekend against UC Davis on Thursday, Nov. 3, and UC Irvine on Saturday, Nov. 5. Both matches are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/","id":5435,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5434,5433,5432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Break Even in Conf.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB was paced on offense by junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman (team high 13 kills) and received important contributions from first-year middle blocker Rowan Ennis (nine kills), redshirt first-year Lindsey Ruddins (eight kills) and redshirt first-year Hannah Juley (23 assists).</p>\n<p>Juley has been dominant of the Gauchos of late, putting her teammates in perfect situations for kills. She remains fourth in Big West play with 10.50 assists per set but will face off against the most prolific setter in the conference, junior Taylor Nelson.</p>\n<p>Nelson has been a constant catalyst for success on this Cal Poly team, with 12.09 assists per set and almost 400 total in conference play. Last outing against the Gauchos, she recorded 36 assists in three sets of work, and will need to be limited if UCSB hopes to come away with a win this time around.</p>\n<p>The biggest beneficiary of Nelson’s hard work has been Raeann Greisen, whose 4.16 kills per set on a .334 kill percentage — only 35 total errors on 293 attacks — have made her the most efficient high volume scorer in the Big West throughout the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s defense relies heavily on the effort of sophomore libero Katherine Brouker. Her 14 digs were a team high last time out against the Gauchos, and she ranks fourth since conference play started with 4.25 digs per set.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, one of the two players she trails in digs over that span is UCSB sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi, who averages 4.59 digs per set. Petrachi also bested Brouker in digs in the first match between the teams, finishing with 15 on the evening.</p>\n<p>Gaucho senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will participate in what could be her final match against Cal Poly after missing the first contest with the conference foes.</p>\n<p>Newcomer Lindsey Ruddins has also made a huge impact, especially considering that she’s returning from injury. In fact, the freshman just won conference freshman of the week for the fourth time this season, most of any first-year, after averaging 4.89 kills per set last weekend and acquiring a .330 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are pumped for this weekend as their recent play as well as the upcoming opponent are providing all the inspiration they need.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the matchup,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “Obviously, it’s a rivalry game, so it brings out a lot of excitement and energy from our team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to San Luis Obisbo on Friday, Oct. 28, and the teams will play at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73492\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73492\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/","id":5434,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5433,5432,5431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB With Fourth Consecutive Split Result","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite taking the Big West's top team in the standings in Long Beach State to five sets, the UCSB women's volleyball team fell short of an upset and endured another loss CSUN to close out the weekend...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s volleyball split its weekend matches for the fourth consecutive time, losing 3-2 Friday night to Long Beach State 21-25, 22-25, 25-15, 25-21 and 15-13.

The 49ers finished the weekend with the continuance of their unblemished conference record, earning victories over UCSB and Cal Poly and improving to 15-7 overall and 9-0 in the Big West.

We’re trying to get an opportunity to go in the postseason because I think we can really make a run,” said senior middle Elizabeth Sheffield. “We’ve had some pretty tough losses this season, but when we play the way we played tonight, we can do really well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to take the Big West leading Long Beach State 49ers to five sets, something that had happened just twice in conference play prior to Friday’s match. UCSB had not yet played a fifth set since beginning the conference schedule on Sept. 23.</p>\n<p>For the first time against a Big West opponent this season, Long Beach State found itself in a two-set hole early in the match.</p>\n<p>The match’s first set began with a furious back-and-forth; the score tied up 6 times before settling at only 10 apiece.</p>\n<p>After three straight errors for UCSB, first-year outside hitter Megan Rice notched three kills, junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman added a service ace and redshirt first-year outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins earned a kill of her own, taking what had been a three-point deficit and turning it into the first Gaucho lead since the set’s third point.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to successfully hold off the 49ers for the remainder of the set, though the pesky 49er squad would never trail by more than three until first-year defensive specialist Maxine Burke’s service ace gave the Gauchos a 25-21 win.</p>\n<p>Megan Rice and Lindsey Ruddins would again prove decisive characters in the second frame, with two kills each in UCSB’s first eight points of the set. First-year middle blocker Rowan Ennis would add a kill of her own, and two service aces early in the set from Lexi Rottman would aid an early 9-3 Gaucho lead.</p>\n<p>The 49ers would did their best to close the gap, but the Gauchos contained LBSU with an excellent offensive effort, out-hitting their opponent for the second consecutive set, this time .314 to .281.</p>\n<p>Sensing their backs against the wall, Long Beach came out firing in the third set, the most lopsided of the entire match and a decisive turning point in what had been UCSB’s night.</p>\n<p>UCSB was sloppy to say the least in the third, as they would produce their first eight-error set of the night, coincidentally <em>not </em>their last of the sort.</p>\n<p>Despite several errors early on, the Gauchos still fought to a 14-13 deficit, capped by a block from Rowan Ennis and Megan Rice.</p>\n<p>The train came off the tracks at that point, however, as a series of kills, including three from junior middle blocker Ashley Murray, and attack errors from UCSB would result in an 11-2 set-ending run for LBSU.</p>\n<p>The 49ers dominated the Gauchos in hitting percentage, racking up a .440 mark of their own while holding UCSB to a minuscule .000.</p>\n<p>After playing to an eight-point tie in the fourth, a five-point LBSU run would set the difference between the two teams for the majority of the set’s remainder. A late four-point run, including two kills from Lindsey Ruddins, would bring the Gauchos within three, but a kill from sophomore outside hitter Megan Kruidhof assisted by redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens sent the teams to a fifth set.</p>\n<p>The tie-breaker was the closest set of the match, with neither team ever gaining more than a two-point lead.</p>\n<p>Kills from Chanel Hoffman and Lindsey Ruddins, accompanied by an attack error from senior outside hitter Nele Barber, put the Gauchos ahead 12-11, a victory against the Big West leaders seemingly within reach.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s resilient offense flexed its muscles once again, though, as Kruidhof killed two attacks, first-year libero Hailey Harward added another, and Nele Barber finished the job with a kill to give the 49ers a 15-13 set win, remaining unblemished on the season.</p>\n<p>Barber was the star of the evening, dominating with 22 kills on a .442 percentage, only three errors and 12 digs. She now stands at second in the conference with 4.17 kills per set in Big West play, and fifth with 4.23 digs per set over the same span.</p>\n<p>Missy Owens was yet again everywhere setting up her teammates, as her 45 assists added to her 11.37 assists per set against Big West competition, a mark that ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was back in early season form for the Gauchos, and her 25 kills (.361 kill percentage) were a match high. Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt also continued to improve after returning from injury, scoring 12 kills on 26 attempts (.308 percentage).</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi continued to lead her team on the defensive end with 16 digs, second in the match to LBSU’s Hailey Harward.</p>\n<p>The match showed the 49ers’ ability to come through in tough spots, as they continued their season-long winning streak in five-set matches, maintaining their storybook year and improving to 15-7 overall and 9-0 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite Friday’s heartbreaker, UCSB came out with a strong performance in its following match against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>A strong first set saw the Gauchos build a 24-16 lead, and despite a flurry of UCSB errors that got CSUN to 20 points, Megan Rice was able to finish the deal with a kill to seal the game.</p>\n<p>The Matadors were much more collected in the second set, playing the Gauchos to a series of ties before grabbing a 20-19 lead late. Two kills from Lindsey Ruddins as well as one from senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield would put the Gauchos up, and despite a short back-and-forth, they would hold the lead to gain a 2-0 set advantage.</p>\n<p>CSUN won a close third set 25-23, with no team ever gaining a large margin over the other. After blowing a 2-0 set lead on Friday, however, the Gauchos were not going to let another match slip between their fingers.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was UCSB’s best, as they produced a kill percentage of .407 on their way to a 25-17 win. A 6-1 run to start the set would prove to be the defining stretch; the cushion would be sufficient to suppress each Matador burst.</p>\n<p>Outside hitters Julie Haake (senior) and Aeryn Owens (sophomore) held down the offensive end for CSUN, with 22 and 16 kills respectively. Owens ranks fourth in Big West play with 4.03 kills per set, while Haake had one of her more impressive matches of the year as she normally averages 2.94 kills per set (14th in the conference).</p>\n<p>Owens added 15 digs, second on the team to junior libero Katie Sato, who accumulated 19 of her own. Junior setter Lauren Conati led the match with 48 assists and contributed a solid eight digs as well.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Sheffield produced a career evening, with nine kills on 13 attempts for an über-efficient .615 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>“We needed more offense and Liz was outstanding coming in off the bench for us,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “She was pretty much unstoppable out of the middle.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley was the ultimate teammate, creating opportunities for her fellow Gauchos all over the court on her way to 47 assists. After 57 in the match against LBSU, she now sits at third in the Big West with 10.50 assists per set against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was again the offensive standout for UCSB, as her 19 kills led the team. She and Chanel Hoffman both rank in the top 10 for kills per set against the Big West, with 3.46 and 3.44 respectively.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have fairly consistently been able to beat teams around their record this season, while running into trouble against the more difficult competition.</p>\n<p>“It comes down to the little things,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “The discipline on defense, a little more effort in your own approach so the offense is cleaner. It’s remembering what’s working for you and resorting to the game plan, so it’s a lot of little things that combine to help you take that next step.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its postseason quest against division rival Cal Poly on Friday, Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. in its only match next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/","id":5433,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5432,5431,5430],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":9,"route":"/categories/sports/volleyball","highestPage":32}},"__N_SSG":true}
