\r\n</script> \n<p>The last matchup between the two squads stayed close at the start with the Gauchos dropping both opening sets 28-26 and 25-22.</p>\n<p>The 49ers would run away with the final set 25-18, however, though a sizable closing run would make what had been a close game a blowout.</p>\n<p>So far in conference play this season, LBSU senior outside hitter Nele Barber has been dominating the competition on her way to 4.00 kills per set.</p>\n<p>She is one of three players in the Big West to have totaled triple digits in total kills, trailing only Hawaii’s Nikki Taylor.</p>\n<p>Though Barber is the cause of most of the team’s overall production, middle blockers YiZhi Xue, a freshman, and junior Ashley Murray rank third and fourth, respectively, in the Big West for hitting percentage, as both have produced at a rate of .375 or higher in conference play.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens ranks second in Big West conference play with 11.65 assists per set, and she is the engine of what has been a productive LBSU offense to start the season.<br>\nOn defense, Barber has contributed further to her team’s success, digging 4.62 attacks per set in conference play.</p>\n<p>She’s accompanied by first-year defensive specialist and libero Hailey Harward who has averaged 4.42 digs per set in her first crack at Big West competition.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will be entering Friday evening on an especially hot streak having beat their top competition in the Big West, Hawaii, two weekends ago three sets to two, and having swept Cal State Northridge in their only match last weekend.</p>\n<p>CSUN hasn’t won since UCSB handed the team its first loss of the season on Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>Over that span, the team has only come away with three set wins in four matches, including consecutive sweeps at the hands of Hawaii and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The Matadors sit at sixth in the conference with a 2-4 record, setting up an even match between them and the Gauchos Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Aeryn Owens sets the tone for CSUN’s offense, and her team leading 3.84 kills per set in conference play places her fifth in the league.</p>\n<p>She receives a tremendous amount of help from junior setter Lauren Conati, whose 9.59 assists against the Big West also rank fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>Junior libero and defensive specialist Katie Sato has been a menace on defense, and she’ll look to build on her 4.48 digs per set since the conference schedule began.</p>\n<p>She’s one of five players averaging over four digs in league play, and will do her best to prevent the Gauchos from finding any easy offensive looks.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman middle blocker Melissa Eaglin will attempt to do the same from the center of the court, as she is one of five players to average at least a block per set throughout the Big West schedule.<br>\nThe Gauchos are excited to build off their previous matches with both teams especially their first loss to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“We played them really close in Long Beach. We were really without Phoebe completely, and Lindsey played just a little bit since it was her first match back after hardly practicing,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “Even with the team we had on the floor last time, we felt confident that if we had cleaned up a few things, [the match] would have gone a different way. Now we just have more strength.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins will look to regain her early season magic as she continues to get her feet back under her after an injury derailed her contributions early in the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman — eighth in Big West play with 3.64 kills per set — and freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis — fifteenth in conference play with 2.76 kills per set — will accompany Ruddins in a now fairly healthy Gaucho attack.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will also be back after playing in some light action last weekend, and she, too, will hope to reproduce her early season dominance.</p>\n<p>The defense, as usual, will be centered around sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who continues to lead the Big West in digs per set with 4.72 and total digs with 326.</p>\n<p>The libero also earned her second Big West Defensive Player of the Week Honors of the season after registering 49 digs in two matches last week against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to use its home court advantage to its full benefit in hopes of extending its one win over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday into a winning streak.</p>\n<p>The longest streak it has put together thus far this season is fives games, which occurred in the earlier portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>When on the losing end of the spectrum, the Gauchos have not tended well, having been swept in six of their eight losses losses this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Long Beach State at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, and Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 22, with both games being played at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>After beginning the second set in decent fashion, a 23-9 Riverside run gave the Highlanders an impenetrable cushion as they raced to a two-set lead.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders hit a resounding .435 in the set, while UCSB was only able to muster a measly .034 hitting percentage, combining only eight kills with seven errors.</p>\n<p>Errors were a problem for UCSB throughout the evening, as they totaled at least seven for each game, while Riverside stayed under that threshold in all but one set.</p>\n<p>Down two sets to none, the Gauchos were able to avoid a three-game sweep, winning 27-25 in the third.</p>\n<p>Midway through the set the Gauchos were able to gain a decent lead, 15-11, but a four-point run locked the two teams in a dead heat for the remainder of the game. After trading the lead back and forth, a trio of kills from redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins and freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis put the Gauchos up one, 26-25.</p>\n<p>A service ace from sophomore setter Annie Hasselmann put the Gauchos over the top and gave them hope down 2-1 in the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasn’t able to carry the momentum to the next set, however, as they turned in their second-worst performance of the match, hitting .094 with eight errors.</p>\n<p>A five-point run started the set for UCR, with a stream of errors putting them in an early hole. Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley began with a service error, followed by an attack error from Rowan Ennis and a bad set, again from Juley.</p>\n<p>After a pair of kills from sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle and freshman outside hitter Mickayla Sherman, a UCR lead of five would set the tone for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB would battle back to a 13-13 tie, but a 5-1 Highlander run would push the lead to 18-14, as they would maintain their distance from the Gauchos and capture the win.</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Mickayla Sherman dominated the match Friday evening, scoring 28.5 points — more than double any UCSB player — and totaling a jaw-dropping 26 kills on 50 attacks. She was also one of four players to achieve at least 11 digs and added three block assists for good measure.</p>\n<p>Joining her in a suburb defensive effort were senior libero and defensive specialist Maddie Hubbell (18 digs), sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle (15 digs), senior outside hitter Cristina Maietta (15 digs) and junior middle blocker Meg Graham (three solo blocks, three assisted blocks).</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle kept things moving for the Highlanders. Her 45 assists were a match high, and she now stands at sixth in Big West conference play with 9.5 assists per set.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was productive for the Gauchos, totaling 13 kills and 11 digs, though her efficiency was subpar, with only a .174 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Matters weren’t much better for junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, who, despite nine kills, 14 digs and two service aces, finished with a kill percentage of .086 on a night when her team couldn’t solve its opponent.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley continued her productive play with 35 assists, two assisted blocks and two service aces, and sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi again contributed a match-high in digs with 20.</p>\n<p>After losing its first two Saturday matches of the season, UCSB was able to pull out the second of its two contests this weekend, beating Cal State Fullerton 26-24, 21-25, 25-19, 25-20.</p>\n<p>The first set started extremely rocky for the Gauchos as they quickly found themselves in a deep 6-0 hole. The run included three kills from sophomore outside hitter Shimen Fayad, and all three were assisted by first-year setter Rachel Hall.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to slowly battle its way back, though, and a 9-2 stretch took the Gauchos from a four-point deficit to a 22-20 lead. Despite a short run from the Titans, UCSB was able to close the set, taking a 1-0 lead in the match.</p>\n<p>Again the Titans began the next set with an eye-popping run, starting the game 5-0 on kills by sophomore middle blocker Summer Kerins and Fayad, as well as a service ace and a bad set by UCSB’s Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>The match’s next point, a kill by UCSB freshman outside hitter Megan Rice, was the last time the Gauchos would be within four points of Cal State Fullerton for the entire second set.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were finally able to prevent a long Cal State run to start the third set, as the two teams stayed within two points of one another until a Devin Joos (sophomore outside hitter) kill on an assist from Hannah Juley gave UCSB a 20-17 lead.</p>\n<p>Joos’ attack came in the midst of an eight-point run for the Gauchos that essentially clinched the third set of the evening.</p>\n<p>UCSB and CSF were again closely matched in the final set, but a steady effort proved to be the deciding factor for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After going down 2-3 early in the set, the Gauchos wouldn’t trail again as they held the Titans to a .091 hitting percentage, slightly above their dismal percentage of .019 in the previous game.</p>\n<p>The UCSB offense put on a show as five different players — Rowan Ennis, Lindsey Ruddins, Devin Joos, Chanel Hoffman, and senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield — had kills in the final frame, helping the Gauchos capture their first win of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Emilia Petrachi had a season-high 29 digs, continuing her campaign as the league’s top defensive player. She received her second Big West Defensive Player of the Week award, and has been the centerpiece of a consistently feisty Gaucho defense.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley reached 50 assists in the match, as she too continues to maintain her team’s flow on offense and put her teammates where they need to be.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos didn’t dominate their opponents despite playing the two weakest Big West teams, but several solid signs shined through. They continue to play good defense with Petrachi leading the way, and UCSB always receives offensive contributions from the top to the bottom of the roster. Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt was also able to play some in the third set, an encouraging sign after missing the previous several matches due to injury.</p>\n<p>This UCSB team has many impressive pieces; it’s just a matter of those pieces coming together to create a greater sum than they have so far this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next host Long Beach State on Friday, Oct. 21 and Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Oct. 22. Both Games will be at the UCSB Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73251\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73251\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/","id":5411,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5410,5409,5408],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope To Take Advantage of Faltering Competition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With hopes of surpassing the .500 mark for its conference record, the UCSB women's volleyball team will look to capitalize upon this week's opponents UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.

Graham holds a hitting percentage of .268, the highest on her team, and has committed only 39 errors on the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Helping set up the pair of outside hitters with scoring opportunities is sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle as she has racked up 8.72 assists per set and will enter Friday with 1,277 assists on the season. Most notably, she has 22 service aces, a mark that ranks fifth in the Big West.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">After a 5-7 finish in their non-conference schedule, the Highlanders have lost each of their Big West matches. They were swept in dominant fashion by Hawaii and came up short against Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and UC Irvine despite taking each to four sets.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">UCR will face Cal Poly on Saturday, and —with that being the first of two opportunities to reverse the disappointing start to its conference schedule — it is plausible that the Highlanders will be prepared and determined to earn victories as the underdogs.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">UCSB’s Saturday opponent, Cal State Fullerton, is coming off a loss to UC Davis that dropped the Titans’ record to 1-3 in conference play.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Titans boast a strong line of outside hitters, with five averaging more than a kill per set. Sophomores Shimen Fayad and Madeline Schneider lead the group with 3.42 and 3.17 kills per set respectively, forming a duo that the Gauchos will have to watch out for all Saturday evening.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Fayad also cleans things up on defense for the Titans, as her team-high 197 digs leads both of the teams’ defensive specialists, though freshman libero Madisen Babich leads the team in digs per set with an average of 3.25 to Fayad’s 3.08.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Freshman setter Rachel Hall leads the Titans with 500 assists on the season, averaging nearly eight per set at 7.94, followed by senior libero Precious Manu, who has registered a total of 166 assists and 5.72 per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Gauchos will attempt to build off their mixed weekend after again displaying flashes of the full potential that was expected to occur all year.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">After redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins played in all three sets against Cal Poly, the team is hopeful she’ll be able to sustain her average of 4.12 kills per set — which ranks second in the conference — through the weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman is not far behind her with 3.41 kills per set. Her performance thus far has been a steadying force for a team that has fluctuated between highs and lows this season.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Moreover, redshirt freshman Hannah Juley has been one of the most productive setters in the league. She’ll look to improve her already stellar average of 9.84 assists per set closer to the double digits this weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">UCSB’s libero, sophomore Emilia Petrachi, continues to reign supreme in the conference with 4.54 digs per set and ranks third in total digs at 277.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Gauchos have the pieces, the coaching and the attitude to still make some serious noise this weekend as they have consistently stuck with teams even in their losses.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">With two wavering opponents, UCSB will look to build some momentum in hopes of improving their record to above the .500 mark.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Gauchos will travel to Riverside this Friday, Oct. 14 to play the Highlanders at 7 p.m. at the SRC Arena. Their road trip will continue at Fullerton on Saturday, Oct. 15 to take on the Titans at 7 p.m. at Titan Gym.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/","id":5413,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5412,5411,5410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Capitalizes Against UC Davis, Falls Flat vs. Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball-DustinHarris-100616-IMG_0028-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball-DustinHarris-100616-IMG_0028-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After picking up its second conference win against UC Davis on Friday, UCSB was unable to even take a set from its green rival Cal Poly Sunday night in a tough loss.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s volleyball split a pair of home matches this past weekend, defeating UC Davis in a close contest 25-23, 21-15, 25-20, 28-26 and falling to Cal Poly in straight sets 25-23, 25-21, 25-16.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match was a grueling affair, as both teams put forth tremendous efforts, leaving everything on the court.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73006\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73006\" data-attachment-id=\"73006\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/ucsb-capitalizes-against-uc-davis-falls-flat-vs-cal-poly/sydney-bast-sends-the-ball-over-the-net-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball-DustinHarris-100616-IMG_0028-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sydney Bast sends the ball over the net.

At 16-11, however, the Gauchos put up four straight and the teams were separated by one point until the set’s concluding score.</p>\n<p>After going up 12-11 in the second, UCSB fell victim to a Davis eruption, as six different players scored seven points to put the Gauchos in an 18-12 hole.</p>\n<p>Two Davis attack errors and a kill by senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield gave the Gauchos a whiff of hope in the set, but UCD was able to stall the comeback and tie the match at one game apiece.</p>\n<p>The third set saw the two team’s barbs early on, with UCSB taking the lead halfway through the game.</p>\n<p>A trio of kills by freshman outside hitter Megan Rice, freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis and junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, all of which were assisted by redshirt freshman Hannah Juley, coupled with a series of UCD attack errors, put the Gauchos on a 7-2 run, that ended up being the deciding stretch of the set.</p>\n<p>With UCSB up 2-1, the final set was without a doubt the most exhausting of the four.</p>\n<p>Neither team could gain much high ground early on as Davis and Santa Barbara both took the lead on several occasions.</p>\n<p>Down 14-15, the Gauchos benefited from four UCD errors and a Chanel Hoffman kill to gain a four point lead, 19-15. UCSB would hold that lead until two kills and a service ace from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom gave the Aggies a game-point opportunity at 25-24.</p>\n<p>After trading scores, Elizabeth Sheffield’s kill tied the set at 26, and she and Chanel Hoffman blocked an attack attempt from Davis’ sophomore outside hitter Emily Allen to give the Gauchos a one-point lead.</p>\n<p>Allen would slip up again, as her attack error on the next point would give the Gauchos a victory in their first match of the weekend, and propel them to 2-2 overall in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had six players with double-digit points, paced by junior middle blocker Aima Eichie with 12 kills and 13.5 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB was in the lead in points and kills by Chanel Hoffman with 17 and 15 respectively, and Hannah Juley was everywhere with 43 assists and 11 digs. Elizabeth Sheffield and Rowan Ennis were also vital to the Gauchos, scoring with 9 and 12 kills apiece, while defensive specialists sophomore Emilia Petrachi and redshirt sophomore Sydney Bast combined for 27 digs to prop up the defense.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s matchup with Cal Poly featured more of the Gauchos’ bugaboos, as they were swept for the third time in conference play.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly bested UCSB in hitting percentage in each of the three sets, reaching a wild level of efficiency with a .419 mark in the final game.</p>\n<p>The match’s first set was as close as it gets, with both teams scoring in decisive outbursts. Cal Poly scored three straight early, only for UCSB to go on a 9-3 run.</p>\n<p>The two squads were within one or two points for the majority of the match, and after a back-and-forth sequence brought the score to 24-23 Cal Poly, a devastating block from sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden and senior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald on Rowan Ennis gave the Mustangs a one-set lead.</p>\n<p>Three Cal Poly kills again opened the next set, though the Mustangs had a much easier time maintaining their lead the second time around.</p>\n<p>UCSB was held at a distance throughout the set, and despite a late run, including a kill by redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins that brought the Gauchos within two, successful attacks from Van Winden and junior outside hitter Raeann Greisen put the Mustangs up 2-0.</p>\n<p>An early six-point run in the third set gave the Mustangs a 9-3 lead they wouldn’t relinquish for the remainder of the evening, as they played their best set of the match.</p>\n<p>Greisen (.423 hitting percentage) and Van Winden (13 kills, 11 digs) were the offensive fulcrums for Cal Poly, while sophomore libero Katherine Brouker contributed heavily on the defensive end with 14 digs of her own.</p>\n<p>Chanel Hoffman (13 kills), Rowan Ennis (nine kills, two assisted blocks) and Lindsey Ruddins (eight kills, .333 hitting percentage) all performed well for the Gauchos, as Ruddins at least was able to play in all three sets after seeing time in only two of the four on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB sits at fourth in the Big West, tied with UC Davis and CSUN with a 2-3 conference record.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will hit the road this weekend for a Friday match at UC Riverside and a Saturday match at Cal State Fullerton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Like the Gauchos, the Aggies won their only Big West game this past weekend against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Relying on a vigorous offense, UCD boasts a .241 kill percentage since beginning conference play. Throughout the entire season thus far, they’ve received over two kills per set from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom and freshman outside hitter Lauren Matias, as well as over three per set from senior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">The Aggies are led in scoring by sophomore outside hitter Emily Allen, who paces her team with 3.73 kills per set and a robust 220 kills so far in the season. She’s also added 2.68 digs per set, contributing to UCD’s 16.12 overall season mark, good for second in the conference.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">That impressive defense is led by redshirt freshman setter and defensive specialist Heather Reed, who has supplied 4.66 digs per set along with only 23 receiving errors in a whopping 443 attempts (.948).</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Around the net, UCSB will have to navigate sophomore middle blocker Kelechi Ohiri who leads the Big West with 1.34 blocks per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">After Thursday’s tilt, the Gauchos will have a day off before Cal Poly arrives for a Saturday night showdown. The Mustangs won both matches between the teams last year, and UCSB will be hungry to wrestle the momentary crown from their central coast rivals.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">The Mustangs receive the bulk of their offensive effort from senior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald (2.38 kills per set), sophomore outside hitter Alexis Clewis (2.87 k/s), junior outside hitter Raeann Greisen (3.13 k/s) and sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden (3.45 k/s).</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">All four rank in the top 20 of the Big West for the statistic, and the Gauchos will have to be keenly focused to deter the Cal Poly attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Junior setter Taylor Nelson is the main catalyst for the Mustangs, racking up 11.25 assists per set, best in the Big West, along with 2.36 digs per set on the season. Nelson is aided on the defensive end by sophomore libero Katherine Brouker, who leads the team with 3.95 digs per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Wins in both games would put the Gauchos right back in the driver’s seat behind Hawaii and Long Beach State in the conference hierarchy. UC Davis and Cal Poly will provide quite a challenge, though, and the Gaucho squad knows a lot will be thrown their way.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">“We’re going to see some different looks,” Lantagne Welch said, leading up to the weekend’s slate of games. “We’re trying to clean up our side of the ball offensively and make sure our first contact is where it needs to be.”</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">UCSB certainly has some key assets on its side that can help them attain two huge Big West wins. One of them is, of course, outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins. The redshirt freshman leads the team in kills per set with 4.33, second best in the conference. This season, Ruddins has earned Big West Freshman of the Week three consecutive weeks in a row.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt has been solid this season as well, serving as a dual threat for the Gauchos. Currently, she is first in the conference in hitting percentage at .394, as well as fifth in blocks per set with 0.98.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">On the defensive side, libero Emilia Petrachi has been an absolute force for Santa Barbara this season. The sophomore recently earned the Big West Defensive Player of the Week for the second time in her career this week, first of the season, after averaging 5.43 digs per set this weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">This season, Petrachi has been one of the best in the Big West as she ranks second and fourth with 4.56 digs per set and 246 total digs, respectively. She leads the team in both categories.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">The inward focus has defined this Gaucho team all season, and they will rely on their evolving take-care-of-business mentality to boost them against Davis and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">UCSB will host the Aggies at 7 p.m. on Thursday and the Mustangs at 7 p.m. Saturday evening. Both games will be held in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Down 9-12, UCSB scored six straight points, forcing a CSUN timeout and creating what would be an insurmountable lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaucho offense was propelled by freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt and junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. They each reached double digits in kills, while all hitting over .340, setting the tone for a ferocious UCSB attack. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN’s standout sophomore outside hitter Aery Owens continued her scoring prowess, averaging four kills per set and amassing a team high of 16 total. Her efficiency was down, however, as Owens was only able to put forth a modest .159 hitting percentage, and she was plagued by errors with nine, a match high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also contributing to the scoring frenzy was the Matadors’ redshirt freshman middle blocker Melissa Eaglin, who amassed 10 kills on a .429 hitting percentage, and scored 14.5 points, second on her team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, the Gauchos relied on sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi’s 22 digs, as well as Phoebe Grunt’s two solo blocks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For CSUN, junior libero and defensive specialist Katie Sato dug 21 attacks, second highest in the match, and sophomore defensive specialist Erin Indermill added 15 of her own. The going was tough in the middle for the Gauchos, as Owens and Eaglin contributed to four and seven assisted blocks, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State would not prove as easy an opponent for the Gauchos, however, as they were swept for the fourth time in six matches and the second time by a conference opponent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first set was the match’s closest, as the opponents traded jabs back and forth before two kills and an attack error gave LBSU a 28-26 win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second set, the Gauchos again kept it close, but after reaching an 8-8 tie, UCSB was held at an arm’s length of two or three points for the remainder of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final set of the match saw UCSB grab an early lead, though the eight-point mark again proved to be a line of demarcation as Long Beach grabbed control of the game, scoring four straight points. A 7-2 run would end the match, as the Gauchos seemed exhausted from the relentless LBSU attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loss came despite Chanel Hoffman’s career evening, totaling a career best 19 kills in the match. She was everywhere on the court, providing a defensive presence with 11 digs, and sending 41 attacks at Long Beach, by far a match high and more than double anyone else on her team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt freshman Hannah Juley was again the catalyst for much of the Gaucho offense, assisting 36 attacks after setting up 45 in Friday’s match.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach produced an extremely consistent attack, with senior outside hitter Nele Barber, freshman outside hitter Ashley Murray and freshman middle blocker Yizhi Xue each exceeding 10 kills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber also led hear team in digs (19), and was helped on defense by freshman defensive specialist and libero Hailey Harward (13 digs) and redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens (10 digs). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, now 1-2 in the Big West, will play their next two at home against UC Davis and Cal Poly. UCSB will look to regain a .500 record in the conference and beat two of the school’s top rivals. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-04/72821/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-04/72821/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-04/72821/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-04/72821/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-04/72821/","id":5398,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5397,5396,5395],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos In Search Of First Conference Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FILEPHOTO-WVolleyball-8-of-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FILEPHOTO-WVolleyball-8-of-20-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After being swept by Hawaii in its first Big West match, UCSB heads on the road to Northridge to try to pick up its first win of the conference season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team has been swept in three of its last four matches.

Redshirt freshman middle blocker Melissa Eaglin leads Northridge with 0.88 blocks per set, and she will be looking to make things tough for the Gauchos over the net.</p>\n<p>Offensively, sophomore outside hitter Aeryn Owens and senior outside hitter Julie Haake carry the load for CSUN as both average over three kills per set and are gradually approaching 200 points on the season. Owens has been vital through the first two in-conference games with 4.6 kills per set, a mark that ranks her third overall in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Junior setter Lauren Conati keeps the gears churning for the Matadors, pacing the team as its leader in assists — at a staggering total of 500 — and service aces at 17.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB will head to Long Beach State for the weekend’s second match. The 49ers will try to maintain their undefeated conference season, a possibility that begins with senior outside hitter Nele Barber.</p>\n<p>Barber has put forth a team-leading 3.80 kills per set, ranking fourth in the conference. In addition, she leads Long Beach with 3.25 digs per set, adding a solid defensive punch to her well-rounded game.</p>\n<p>First-year middle blocker YiZhi Xue holds down the center for the 49ers, and her 1.07 blocks per set are good for third in the conference. Furthermore, she leads her team with a .291 hitting percentage, continuing Long Beach’s trend of producing players who find success on both the offensive and defensive ends.</p>\n<p>A multitude of the 49ers’ kills are set up by redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens who ranks third in the Big West thus far with 10.34 assists per set and is one of only three players in the Big West to average double digits in the category.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos weren’t able to get much going against the Rainbow Wahine last weekend, but the team is comfortable moving forward. This time around, the Gauchos will be keenly focused on capitalizing on their opportunities and regaining a positive record.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face CSUN this Friday, Sept. 30, at 7 p.m. and will travel to play Long Beach State Saturday, Oct. 1, at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The first set began in a close heat as the Gauchos worked their way to an early 6-5 lead. Hawaii was not to be denied, however, and a burst of scoring gave them an 11-6 advantage that would prove insurmountable for the Gauchos, who couldn’t manage to cut the deficit under three for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Beginning a match-long trend, the Rainbow Wahine bested UCSB in hitting percentage .303 to .091 in the first frame. Remarkably, that was the lowest percentage Hawaii would hit for the entire match, as they improved above .400 for the next two sets.</p>\n<p>Hawaii provided another gut punch in the second set, as a dominant performance coupled with a sloppy UCSB showing (eight errors) led the Rainbow Wahine to their most decisive victory of the three games, 25-14.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s hitting percentage actually dropped to .000 while the Wahine jumped to .407, accurately portraying the chasm between the two teams’ second-set performances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to put forth a strong final set, however, finally raising their hitting percentage to a serviceable .241 and amassing double-digit kills (13).</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s vastly improved effort, the 14th-ranked Hawaii squad improved for the third consecutive game, playing a virtually perfect final set on their way to a 25-19 victory.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine boasted a hitting percentage of .448, committed only one error, and each time the Gauchos clawed their way back into contention, Hawaii was poised with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>This impressive Hawaii team refined its attack throughout the evening, asserting itself again as the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>They received important contributions from across the roster, with senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor, sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato, sophomore outside hitter Casey Castillo and reserve senior middle hitter Annie Mitchem leading the team’s offensive wave.</p>\n<p>Each of the four totaled at least seven kills, with Granato leading the pack with 13. Granato and her teammate Castillo hit a resounding .478 and .667 respectively, marking the efficiency with which the Wahine attacked the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>McKenna Granato also collected seven digs, second on the team to first-year setter Norene Iosia (8), adding to her solid all-around performance. Nikki Taylor had four assisted blocks to go along with one solo, further contributing to Hawaii’s stellar defense.</p>\n<p>Despite the disappointing output, several Gauchos still maintained a high level of play.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman amassed 10 kills, and despite her hitting percentage of .200, she was the only Gaucho with double-digit points in the match.</p>\n<p>Coach Lantagne Welch saw several positives throughout the evening that should help the team during the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>“Chloe Allen came off the bench, followed the game plan and went after it. She had success and that was a boost for us,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted of her first-year outside hitter.</p>\n<p>Allen has settled into her role off the bench, garnering the respect of her team and providing the Gauchos with verve in reserve heavy units.</p>\n<p>During the final game, Lantagne Welch was impressed with another first-year, middle blocker Rowan Ennis: “[She] got hot there for a stretch and helped us in the third set.” Ennis’ three kills in the set were vital in keeping the Gauchos within reach of a victory in the final game.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore and defensive specialist Sydney Bast also caught her coach’s eye, as she “helped stabilize [UCSB’s] passing,” while digging a team-high nine attacks.</p>\n<p>When Bast was asked after the game what about the Hawaii team had stumped the Gauchos, she noted, “they have a fast offense and we knew it coming into this game. We prepared for it all week, we just didn’t execute like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>She made sure to mention, though, the team’s consistently positive outlook: “It’s all good. We’re going to get them back at Hawaii.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look for its first conference win against Cal State Northridge on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/","id":5025,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5024,5023,5022],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Concluding its non-conference schedule with a 9-4 overall record, the UCSB women's volleyball team has a difficult opponent ahead to open Big West play as it will host No. 14 Hawaii Friday night.

Ruddins has picked up Big West Freshman of the Week honors for three consecutive weeks after earning three straight all-tournament team honors and leads the team with 196 kills at an average of 4.45 kills per set.</p>\n<p>Hoffman boasts the second most kills on the team with 137, providing the Gauchos with a dominant one-two punch on the outside that opponents have struggle to answer against.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt seems to be on her way to an All-Big West team after earning an Honorable Mention the past two years. She is averaging a team-high .95 blocks per set, providing the Gauchos with a force in the middle that has been essential to their early season success.</p>\n<p>“Phoebe has been the most consistent for us,” Lantagne Welch explained before noting her .410 hitting percentage during the non-conference schedule to lead all Big West players. For her fourth straight season, she’s providing UCSB with excellent all-around play, and, with this young team, her leadership has never been more vital.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense has been propped up by sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who is one of two Big West players to amass over 200 digs in non-conference play. She’s been seemingly everywhere on the court, and the Gauchos will be relying on her prowess when facing the talent within the Big West.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will be on the road for the first time this season as it played all 11 of its non-conference matches at home in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p>With a 7-4 record, the Rainbow Wahine are 14th in the national Division I rankings and will be one of the toughest teams the Gauchos have faced so far.</p>\n<p>After missing the first three matches of the season, senior outside hitter and last year’s Big West Player of the Year Nikki Taylor leads the Big West with 5.41 kills per set, almost a full kill more than Ruddins, who holds second place by a sizable margin.</p>\n<p>Junior libero and defensive specialist Savanah Kahakai is third in the Big West with 4.40 digs per set, only slightly behind Petrachi, and she’s sure to make things difficult for the Gaucho offense throughout the match.</p>\n<p>Junior middle hitter Emily Maglio will only make matters more difficult for UCSB as her 1.25 blocks per set rank second in the conference, not to mention her jarring .390 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The veteran laden Rainbow Wahine will provide an important test for the Gauchos to open conference play as Coach Lantagne Welch mentioned UCSB’s tendency to “make rookie mistakes” in certain situations.</p>\n<p>“The big thing is, if we take care of our side and [ride] out at a really high percentage, we’re going to be in a good situation,” Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>Thus far, it has been an exciting season for the Gauchos who have showed that youth doesn’t always need time to mature before success. A visit from the 2015 Big West champions will provide a true test for the young squad who finished a modest 3-13 in conference play last season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos certainly think they belong, however, and Lantagne Welch is fully committed to ensuring that she and her team believe they are capable.</p>\n<p>“We do have some goals; we want to go after this Big West championship,” Lantagne Welch said. “[Most importantly], focusing on what we can do this day and focus[ing] on our next match.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and Hawaii will face off on Friday, Sept. 23 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of September 22, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72520\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72520\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/","id":5019,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5018,5017,5016],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sweep Through USF Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is off to its best start since 2009 after winning the USF tournament in which newcomer Lindsey Ruddins shined and was named MVP.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After impressive performances in the season’s two opening weekends resulted in a rock solid 5-2 start, this UCSB team still appears to have room to improve as the season continues.</p>\n<p>Traveling to USF for the San Francisco Challenge, the Gauchos swept their three matches against Brown, Saint John’s and the hosting university, losing only one set over the two days.</p>\n<p>In their first match, UCSB controlled each game, winning 25-18, 25-11 and 25-21.

UCSB’s outside hitters were outstanding, with redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins contributing seven kills, freshman Megan Rice adding six and junior Chanel Hoffman rounding out the unit with five more.</p>\n<p>Freshman Charlie Robinson and senior Phoebe Grunt were also tremendous for the Gauchos at middle blocker; Robinson had six kills on 11 attempts, good for a team-best .545 kill percentage, and Grunt’s 10.5 points were good for second highest for the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB hit a much higher percentage than Brown throughout the match, staying over .300 for all three games, and topping .400 in the first frame. Though the Bears hit .368 to open the match, the team followed with a dismal second set including 10 errors on the way to a -.143 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Brown’s junior libero and defensive specialist Melissa Cairo impressed on defense, securing more digs (10) than any other player in the match, and sophomore hitter Sabrina Stillwell still managed to come away with seven kills.</p>\n<p>The second match was UCSB’s closest of the day, as an undefeated St. John’s team came out fast with a 25-16 win in the opening set.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hit a poor .088 compared to the Red Storm’s .360 and committed nine errors to St. John’s one, leading to a mess of a first game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>They would come back to win the next three sets 25-22, 25-22 and 25-23 on the back of a match-high 20 kills from Lindsey Ruddins, who continues to rack up points for the Gaucho offense. Her dominant performance was paired with sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi’s, who carried the UCSB defense with 16 digs, also tops for the contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to best St. John’s in hitting percentage for the remainder of the match, accumulating 16 and 15 kills in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Each of the games were close with both teams trading impressive runs throughout the entire match, easily UCSB’s most difficult in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>St. John’s was led by strong efforts from their outside hitters, sophomore Margherita Bianchin and freshman Gaia Traballi, who amassed 14 and 12 kills respectively. Junior middle blocker Julia Cast and senior outside hitter Mona Karkkainen, both of whom also spend time at opposite hitter, turned in important performances as they were the third and fourth players on St. Johns to have double digit points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished Saturday’s double header strong, beating the host USF in straight sets 26-24, 25-12 and 25-15.</p>\n<p>Starting quickly was again an issue for the Gauchos, as a back and forth game appeared almost out of reach after falling behind 24-21. UCSB would fight back several set points, however, as a calm approach allowed them to maintain their focus and stave off their second lost game of the day.</p>\n<p>UCSB still held a strong advantage over the Dons in kill percentage in the first set, suggesting the gap between the two teams may have been wider than the score suggested. Such a hypothesis was strongly supported throughout the final two frames, with the Gauchos dominating the second set on the back of a game-winning 12-5 run and a staggering .688 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>The final set started with a 6-1 Gaucho run, and another six-point burst would all but seal the game and end the match.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Chanel Hoffman were again offensive centerpieces for UCSB, each totaling double-digit points, while Emilia Petrachi turned in another day’s work with 15 digs.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley and sophomore defensive specialist Lexi Rottman added 8 and 7 digs respectively, completing a great defensive effort from the Gauchos which saw the Dons finish with hitting percentages of -.043 and .057 in the final games.</p>\n<p>USF’s outside hitters played a solid game, with freshman Tyna Adamcikova providing 13 points and senior Emily Reed adding nine of her own.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was named the tournament’s most outstanding player with 38 kills and was joined on the all-tournament team by teammate Phoebe Grunt.</p>\n<p>This was Ruddins’s third time in as many opportunities this season making the all-tournament team, as well as her third time being awarded the Big West Freshman of the Week. Ruddins was nominated for the Player of the Week as well, and with her dominant play it would not be a surprise to see her take home that acknowledgment sooner than later.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos sit atop the Big West at 8-2 and will travel next to San Diego where they will participate in the California Mixer with San Diego State, San Jose State and USD on September 16 and 17.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72430\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72430\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/","id":5018,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5017,5016,5015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Two Out of Three on Opening Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_004.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_004.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos started the season off the right way winning two of their three matches on the first weekend of action.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team started the season in impressive fashion over the final weekend in August, collecting two wins in three matches.

UNLV held second set advantages of three in both errors and kills, and a five-point run, pushing the lead from 15-13 to 20-13, all but sealed the Gauchos fate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB played well in the final frame, however, as the game was tied 25-25 before kills by redshirt senior middle blocker Bree Hammel and senior outside hitter Elisa Woinowsky, both of which were assisted by junior setter Alexis Patterson, propelled UNLV over the enduring Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins, an outside hitter, stood out for the Santa Barbara squad.  She led the match in points with 16.5, edging out UNLV’s Bree Hammel by a point and a half. Ruddins had a whopping 46 total attacks, 15 more than Hammel and 17 more than Alyssa Wing, the match’s second and third most active attackers.</p>\n<p>A disheartening first match didn’t deter the Gauchos from a successful day, as the following contest against New Mexico State was an absolute thriller. Lasting five games, the match saw UCSB battle back from two sets down, once again on the back of Lindsey Ruddins and her match-high 26 points.</p>\n<p>The Aggies took the first two sets 30-28 and 25-22 before the Gauchos stormed back, winning the next three sets 25-23, 25-19 and 15-13.</p>\n<p>Ruddins repeated her performance as the match’s most valuable player with 65 attacks and 24 kills, both match highs. Chanel Hoffman, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt and freshman middle blocker Charlie Robinson each added double digit points for the Gauchos, and Grunt and freshman middle blocker/opposite hitter Rowan Ennis contributed impressive hitting percentages of .316 and .471 respectively.</p>\n<p>After reaching a 14-14 draw midway through the fourth set, the Gauchos ended the game with an 11-5 run, giving the team a boost of momentum heading into the tie-breaker. The final game was close, but UCSB again pulled away at the end, sealing their first victory of the day on a Ruddins kill, assisted by redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>The Aggies received important contributions from across the roster, including junior outside hitter Jordan Abalos, sophomore outside hitter Tatyana Battle, junior middle hitter Sasha-Lee Thomas, and junior outside hitter Kassandra Tohm. Each of the four totaled at least 16 kills as the Gauchos faced a relentless effort all evening from the NMSU hitters.</p>\n<p>In their final match of the day, the Gauchos sent Albany to 0-3 on the weekend, with sets of 27-25, 23-25, 25-23 and 25-21.</p>\n<p>The Great Danes kept it close with a spirited performance from sophomore libero Nicole Otero, who amassed 27 digs — 10 more than any other player in the contest — and a balanced attack, with four players finishing with double-digit points.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense proved too much for Albany, however, as Ruddins continued her stellar performance and completed her third game of the Invitational in which she led all players in points, attacks, and kills. The redshirt first-year was a revelation in her first weekend of the 2016 season, and after an injury-marred 2015, Ruddins appears to be on pace for a dominant season leading the Gauchos offense.</p>\n<p>Phoebe Grunt also contributed 17 kills in the final match — second only to Ruddins — completing a solid weekend of her own. Sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi was vital to the Gaucho’s solid defense over the weekend, amassing a staggering 64 digs and leading all players in the first two matches with 25 and 27 digs respectively.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play next at the UCSB Tournament over Labor Day weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72379\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/ucsb-wins-two-out-of-three-on-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72379\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/ucsb-wins-two-out-of-three-on-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/ucsb-wins-two-out-of-three-on-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/ucsb-wins-two-out-of-three-on-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/ucsb-wins-two-out-of-three-on-opening-weekend/","id":5363,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5362,5361,5360],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Add Six Recruits, Earn No. 24 Class","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Arguably the program's worst season ever, after a 7-20 overall and 3-13 Big West finish, the UCSB women's volleyball team will attempt to avenge its poor performance with a No. 24 recruiting class tha...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After recording program lows in overall and Big West wins with a 7-20, 3-13 eighth-place finish last season, it can be assured that the UCSB women’s volleyball program is determined to redeem itself in the 2016 season.</p>\n<p>Currently in her fourth year as Head Coach, Nicole Lantagne Welch will look to recapture the winning chemistry that amazed many in her debut season with the school in 2013, in which she helped lead the Gauchos to their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2010.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71389\" style=\"width: 566px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71389\" data-attachment-id=\"71389\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gauchos-add-six-recruits-earn-no-24-class/devin-joos-reaches-to-pass-a-short-ball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Devin Joos reaches to pass a short ball.

A four-year member of the varsity team, Allen also played for Santa Barbara Club Volleyball.</p>\n<p>Boasting a .362 hitting percentage at the end of her senior year, Rice presents a dual-threat skillset that can be productive both on the offensive and defensive sides of the net. Hailing from Redondo Union High School, she posted 32 kills and six blocks in a regional semifinals match this past postseason.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping her team win a Division IAA Championship her sophomore season, Rice’s high school career also includes a Third-Team AVCA All-America selection, 2015 Conference I Player of the Year honors and more.</p>\n<p>With a total of three middle blockers on its current 2016 spring roster, much intrigue has been directed towards the additions of Ennis and Robinson who both play the position as well.</p>\n<p>Preparing to make the trek from Virginia to Santa Barbara, Ennis attended First Colonial High School, where she put together an illustrious career with a program-record 1,340 kills. She is another proven winner added to the Gauchos’ roster, helping the Patriots win back-to-back Conference I Championships in 2013 and 2014. Ennis topped off her time spent playing in high school as an Honorable Mention AVCA Under Armour All-America recipient.</p>\n<p>Selected as one of the nation’s top 150 players in the nation in <em>Prepvolleyball’s</em> “Senior Aces” list, Robinson will enter UCSB next season after time spent with one of California’s best programs at Marymount High School of Palisades, Calif. Prior to the start of her senior season earlier this year, Robinson was ranked 16th amongst current players in the state in total kills.</p>\n<p>Helping ensure that plays and rotations go as planned will be the additions of libero Maxine Burke and Wisconsin transfer setter Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>Hoping to complement the play of sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi, a member of the Big West All-Freshman Team, Burke will be added to another impacted position as the Gauchos currently have three liberos aboard their team.</p>\n<p>Coming out of JSerra Catholic High School, Burke also played for Tstreet Volleyball Club. She was a Trinity League Second-Team selection in her senior season.</p>\n<p>The only player of this year’s recruiting class to participate on UCSB’s spring team, as other recruits wait to graduate, Juley will not have to redshirt in her first year with the Gauchos after redshirting her freshman year with the Badgers.</p>\n<p>Averaging 11.4 assists and 2.6 digs per match her senior year of high school, she helped Lyons Township High School earn a West Suburban Silver Championship. From LaGrange, Ill., Juley was an AVCA First-Team All-American in 2015 along with other accolades as she finished with 1,590 assists and 523 digs in her high school career.</p>\n<p>Assisting Coach Lantagne-Welch prepare this year’s team will be the hiring of Chad Gatzlaff as an assistant coach.

He set career-best season totals with 73 kills, 35 aces, and 1159 assists. Seif’s 4332 career helpers are the fourth highest in UCSB history, and his 118 service aces rank third in the school record books.</p>\n<p>His performances, throughout his career, were honored with various awards and all-team selections too. The four-year starter will be graduating having been recognized with three All-MPSF First Team awards and will likely be named an All-American for the third-straight year in the upcoming weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with Seif, McLaughlin will be losing three more seniors — Austin Kingi, Ryan Hardy, and Spencer Buckley. Kingi and Hardy, starting outside hitter and middle blocker, respectively, were third and fourth on the team with 227 kills (2.47 per set) and 166 (1.68 per set). Buckley, another outside hitter, only played in three matches, but averaged 1.4 kills per set on the year.</p>\n<p>The rest of the starting lineup, including kill-leader Matt Marsh, who averaged 3.29 kills per set as the focal point of the Gaucho offense, will return next season, which bodes well for the squad considering how some of the younger players developed towards the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Henri Cherry had a breakout year, averaging 2.01 kills per set on a team-best .486 hitting percentage. Another surprise was the performance of sophomore Hayden Boehle, who after a late-season position change from libero to outside hitter, tallying 12 kills in two of UCSB’s last four matches.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished the year with an impressive 13-2 at Rob Gym, but struggled with consistency on the road, where they were 7-8, none more painful than the season-ender in Provo.</p>\n<p>Still, Seif and McLaughlin said all year that they wanted to make a run they could be proud of, and it’s safe to say they did just that, playing some of the best volleyball in the nation for the last month of the year, and after forcing five sets against BYU, the Gauchos fell just short of a conference championship appearance.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70591\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70591\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/","id":5366,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5365,5364,5363],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Fall Short in Comeback Attempt, Await Selection Process","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MVolleyball_vsPepperdine-20150130-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MVolleyball_vsPepperdine-20150130-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling behind 2-0, the No. 6 UCSB men's volleyball team managed to nearly stage a victory in its comeback pursuit in its MPSF Semifinal matchup against No. 1 BYU.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past Thursday, the No. 5 seeded UCSB men’s volleyball team managed to force a fifth set against No. 1 BYU after dropping the first two frames, but were unable to close out the match in its final stretch as the Gauchos’ six-match streak was ended in the MPSF Semifinals.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60921\" style=\"width: 334px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60921\" data-attachment-id=\"60921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/mens-volleyball-sweeps-ucla-on-the-road/mvolleyball_vspepperdine-20150130-dustinharris-1-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MVolleyball_vsPepperdine-20150130-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Hayden Boehle passes the ball, while Jacob Delson is ready to assist.

Senior Jonah Seif took over at the start of the third set, though, to help his team back into the match.</p>\n<p>The setter recorded two kills and five assists to race out to a 7-2 lead in the third, and the Gauchos were able to hold onto their lead for the rest of the set to close it out 25-23. Seif finished the night with 57 assists and seven kills to his name.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s attack was distributed particularly evenly, with all five hitters recording at least 12 kills, led by junior opposite Matt Marsh and senior middle blocker Ryan Hardy, who each tallied 15.</p>\n<p>In the fourth set it was more of the same, with the Gauchos fending off the Cougars, holding onto their lead from 10-10 and beyond, never leading by more than two in the frame. Sophomore outside hitter Hayden Boehle, who made his way into the starting lineup during the last week of the regular season, led the team with 5 of his 12 kills in the set.</p>\n<p>Hayden’s brother, junior libero, Parker, continued his string of impressive defensive performances, recording a game-high 16 digs in the loss. The libero counted his eighth ten-dig game of the season, and the fourth in as many games, leading the defensive charge.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense couldn’t contain the threat of BYU opposite Ben Patch, who tallied a game high 32 kills, the highest total by a player in any of the Gauchos’ matches this year.</p>\n<p>Patch closed out the match in the final set, too, with five kills in the frame, two of which all but sealed the fixture, giving BYU a three-point lead at 13-10. Patch and co. ultimately held onto their three-point lead to advance to the MPSF Conference Championship game against UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now look towards the draw for the 2016 Spring Championship Selection, which airs today at 10 a.m. live on <em><a href=\"http://ncaa.com\">NCAA.com</a></em>.</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently ranked No. 6 in the Coaches’ Poll, and will be vying for one of the last spots in the six-team field which will almost certainly include No.1 BYU, No.2 Ohio State and No. 3 UCLA. The last three spots are open for the taking, with the next five teams in the national rankings coming out of the powerful MPSF.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/","id":5350,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5349,5348,5347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Upset Alert?

The win streak has been led by senior setter Jonah Seif and his crew of hitters, namely redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh.<br>\nSeif, who was just named to the MPSF All-Conference First Team, has 1,102 assists on the year and is eight assists away from setting his career-high single-season assist total.</p>\n<p>Marsh, Second Team honoree, has led the offense since outside hitter Jacob Delson’s ankle injury averaging 14.6 kills per match in the past five.</p>\n<p>The two other All-Conference Gauchos, redshirt senior middle blockers Ryan Hardy and redshirt freshman Henri Cherry, who were both Honorable Mentions, have also come up huge to take pressure off of the hitters offensively.</p>\n<p>Hardy tallied a season-high 12 kills last week and Cherry, also named to the All-Freshman team, has averaged 9.2 kills per match for the duration of the team’s win streak.</p>\n<p>Delson has been easing back into the team after missing two weeks and came on to serve at the end of three sets last match against Stanford.</p>\n<p>One of the unsung heroes of the Gauchos’ recent run has been libero Parker Boehle. The defensive specialist has recorded double-digit digs in the past three matches, including 14 in the first round against Stanford.</p>\n<p>In the conference meetings with BYU, Santa Barbara struggled to contain the Cougar attack as they hit for .330 and .487 in each match. UCSB has been steadier defensively as of late, recording 40 digs in its last three showings.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos win at BYU, they would book themselves in a spot in the MPSF Conference Finals, against the either second-seed UCLA or third-seed CSULB.</p>\n<p>The semifinal will take place tonight at 6:35 p.m. in Provo, Utah.
