UCSB led 11-8 in the final set, but were unable to hang on for the upset, as the ‘Beach’, led by freshman outside hitter TJ DeFalco, finished the game on a four-point run to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>“We really should have won that match, we were up three points late in the fifth set, but we talked after the game in the locker room and agreed that we put together a pretty good effort and there wasn’t much to be upset about,” UCSB redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson said.</p>\n<p>Delson struggled in the first two sets of the match, notching four attacking errors and zero kills, but still showed improvements during the second. By the end of the night, the outside hitter had a team-high 14 kills. Redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh also ended the match with 14 kills.</p>\n<p>Delson and Marsh, despite each tallying double-figures in kills, struggled hitting against the tough Long Beach defense, finishing the game with .140 and .143 kill percentages, well below each of their season averages of .257 and .303, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We made way too many errors,” Delson said. “We made a ton of hitting errors and some service errors that were pretty crucial.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, however, made up for poor hitting percentages with superb team defense. Marsh and redshirt senior Austin Kingi both tallied double-doubles in kills and digs while senior setter Jonah Seif finished with a match-high 15 digs. Redshirt freshman middle blocker Connor Drake led the front line with eight blocks, also a match-high.</p>\n<p>Long Beach made its fair share of mistakes too with 26 service errors to the Gauchos’ total of 10. Despite the errors by both sides, the momentum continued to shift between both teams as UCSB gave itself a great chance to win in the fifth set, only four points away from knocking off the No. 2 team in the nation.</p>\n<p>“This was a tough loss, no doubt about it,” Gauchos’ Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “But you have to experience a few of these to learn how to better deal with that tight atmosphere late in close matches.”</p>\n<p>With the MPSF season in full swing, McLaughlin’s team faces a tough string of matches, with five of its next six matches coming against Top 10 teams in the country, including No. 3 BYU this week, followed by No. 6 Stanford, No. 8 Pepperdine, and No. 9 Irvine.</p>\n<p>“It’s good we had this game early in the season because we have to learn how to fight and pull out a win in these long matches, and it should really help us out against BYU this week,” Delson said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host BYU for a two game series on Friday and Saturday at Rob Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

CSUN’s first loss brought them to 2-1 in league, 7-1 overall, ending the Matadors’ longest win streak to begin a season in program history.</p>\n<p>“Northridge is a really good team, but they were off their game tonight, but I think part of that was us carrying out what we prepped on for the last two days,” UCSB Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos were able to jump out to a quick lead, starting the match on a 15-4 run, handily grabbing the first set.</p>\n<p>They registered three aces, including two from redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh, and seven blocks in the opening set, setting the tone for the team’s assured performance.</p>\n<p>“The loss against Irvine was tough, so we knew we had to come out strong in the first game because Northridge was undefeated, and as long as we got on top of them fast, we’d be good,” redshirt senior outside hitter Austin Kingi said.</p>\n<p>All year, Coach McLaughlin has been preaching the importance of stability in UCSB’s play, and his players heeded the advice, dic-tating the pace of the match with well-placed serves and solid team defense. The win was the Gauchos’ first straight set victory against a ranked team this season.</p>\n<p>“The passing was great and the serving put pressure on them more consistently than what we’ve been doing, and if you win the serve and pass battles, the game’s usually going to go in your favor,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>The match marked the first time UCSB played in Robertson Gym since the Asics Invitational, where it finished a perfect 3-0, and McLaughlin’s team entered the match with the intent of putting its recent weeks of practice and league games on display in front of the home crowd.</p>\n<p>“We were all really excited to play here because we’ve been playing away, and we got to really showcase our talent and what we’ve been working on,” Kingi said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed vast improvements in their play, highlighted by their 24 blocks on the night, four short of their season-high against Loyola (Ill.).</p>\n<p>Kingi tallied seven kills, the third highest on the team behind Marsh, 13, and redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson, 10.</p>\n<p>“Our blocking really came together, which we’ve been practicing a lot lately, and we’ve been swinging well. We’re just fine-tuning everything,” Kingi said.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is perhaps their toughest match of the young MPSF season, a clash with No. 2 Long Beach State tomorrow. Long Beach is 3-2 in conference, 6-2 overall and will be looking to avenge yesterday’s narrow five-set loss against national No. 1 and MPSF leaders UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos split last year’s series with the 49ers 1-1, each team grabbing their wins on the road; both matches ended 3-1. In UCSB’s win, senior Ryan Hardy had a huge night, posting 10 kills and participating in nine blocks.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s match against Long Beach State will be played at Robertson Gym at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/","id":5058,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5057,5056,5055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Improves to 4-1 in MPSF Standings with Wins Over No. 15 USC and Cal Baptist","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-8-web-e1453698607302.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-8-web-e1453698607302.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Back-to-back 54 assists outings performances by senior setter Jonah Seif helped the UCSB men's volleyball team to wrap up its road trip with a 3-1 record.

We did what we had to do to get the wins.”</p>\n<p>Against Cal Baptist, McLaughlin’s team struggled to build any major momentum as it dropped the second and fourth sets. Yet, the Gauchos were led by Marsh and redshirt junior Jacob Delson, who each tallied 17 kills, along with redshirt junior libero Parker Boehle, who led the team with 11 digs.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got to give [CBU] a lot of credit,” McLaughlin said. “They definitely outplayed us those two games. They were the steadier team, and put a ton of pressure on us with great serving at key times, but our guys played their best in the final game.”</p>\n<p>Senior Jonah Seif put in a clutch serving performance in the last set, earning three-straight points for his team to give the Gauchos a comfortable 7-3 lead before eventually securing the victory. Seif has been the most consistent player for UCSB this season, notching match-high 54 assists against USC and Cal Baptist.</p>\n<p>Seif’s first big night at USC was paired with Marsh’s best match of the year as Marsh tied his career-high of 19 kills to go along with a .400 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“Against USC I was hitting pretty well and had a couple good service runs,” Marsh said. “The team as a whole brought a lot of energy, and after the set we dropped we all got more serious.”</p>\n<p>The opposite missed all but one game last year due to injury, but has been in peak form for the first four matches of MPSF play. He has averaged 3.81 kills per set since the beginning of conference play and has been reliable when the team needs improvements in its performance. Marsh registered eight kills in the third set alone against USC, helping lead the Gauchos after their loss in the previous set.</p>\n<p>“As a team we have to finish what we started,” Marsh said. “We came out strong and then struggled in the set we lost, but it’s great to pick up a couple road wins.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has now played against each of the four bottom ranked teams in the MPSF, but will face the tougher part of its schedule in the following week tougher set of matches. Marsh and company will be looking to defend their home court against undefeated no. 12 CSUN Wednesday, Jan. 27. The Gauchos then move onto No. 2 Long Beach State Friday, Jan. 29, who were handed their first loss of the season on Friday by No. 3 BYU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67596\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67596\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/","id":5057,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5056,5055,5054],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Travels to No. 15 USC Thursday Night, Cal Baptist Friday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos play No. 15 USC and Cal Baptist this weekend after getting off to a 1-1 start in MPSF conference play last weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67482\" style=\"width: 230px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67482\" data-attachment-id=\"67482\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/no-9-ucsb-travels-to-no-15-usc-thursday-night-cal-baptist-friday/mvball_vsnjit-20160108-dustinharris-6-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-6-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67482\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=220%2C330\" alt=\"Running up to the net, Hayden Boehle digs a short ball.

The visitors pulled back one set before dropping the fourth, ending an underwhelming match against the defending MPSF champions.</p>\n<p>“Everybody struggled,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Nobody played their game, no matter how good they can be. We were all a bit under par and we can’t let that happen anymore.”<br>\nUCSB will look to bounce back Thursday against the Trojans, who have managed to stay ranked despite beginning the season on a four-game losing streak. The two teams split last year’s series 1-1, both sides winning their home fixtures.</p>\n<p>“USC is always good,” McLaughlin said. “They started this year a little rough, but we’re playing at USC and it’s their home opener, so it’s going to be tough.”<br>\nUCSB enters the match against USC with a definitive edge on both sides of the net. The Gauchos are averaging 12.62 kills per set and 8.08 digs per set, while the Trojans are averaging 10.8 and 5.5 kills and digs per set thus far this year.</p>\n<p>Ryan Hardy played an important role in in last year’s two games against the Trojans, averaged six kills per match, including 12 in their 3-2 loss on the road. The redshirt senior middle blocker returned from injury last week after missing three games with an ankle injury, tallying five kills in the Gauchos win at UCSD and eight in the Irvine match, and was vocal about how he is recovering from missing time.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come back with the urgency to play because I want to be on the court and I want to be a leader,” Hardy said. “I’m a fifth year senior, so I want to take advantage of all of my time out there.”</p>\n<p>The leadership that Hardy brings to the team will be invaluable as the Gauchos continue their road trip on Friday against Cal Baptist, UCSB’s fourth-straight road game.</p>\n<p>“Their place is another really tough place to play,” McLaughlin said. “They play in a really small gym and get it going with their crowd, so it’s a different challenge.”</p>\n<p>Van Dyne Gym, home of the Lancers, seats just over 1,000 and is known for a raucous cheering section, but UCSB won’t be easily fazed. In its last trip to Cal Baptist, Santa Barbara handily won the match 3-0. UCSB also won its home meeting with the Lancers in straight sets.</p>\n<p>A pair of wins this week would keep McLaughlin’s squad in primed position for an MPSF title challenge, keeping it on pace with Irvine and just a game back of the three-team tie for first — No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 Long Beach State and No. 12 CSUN.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play in back-to-back road matches this week. UCSB will face USC at the Galen Center on tonight at 7 p.m. Following, it will play Cal Baptist on Friday, Jan. 22 in Van Dyne Gym at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67526\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/no-9-ucsb-travels-to-no-15-usc-thursday-night-cal-baptist-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67526\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/no-9-ucsb-travels-to-no-15-usc-thursday-night-cal-baptist-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/no-9-ucsb-travels-to-no-15-usc-thursday-night-cal-baptist-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/no-9-ucsb-travels-to-no-15-usc-thursday-night-cal-baptist-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/no-9-ucsb-travels-to-no-15-usc-thursday-night-cal-baptist-friday/","id":5056,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5055,5054,5053],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 UCSB Handles UCSD, Outmatched by No. 4 Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos rallied in the first set to take down UCSD, but couldn't match the talent of a strong Anteater side.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67449\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67449\" data-attachment-id=\"67449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/no-13-ucsb-handles-ucsd-outmatched-by-no-4-irvine/matt-marsh-digs-a-hard-hit-right-to-him-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Matt Marsh digs a hard hit right to him.

The Anteater’s leading hitter notched 19 kills and 12 digs, pairing up with setter Michael Saeta to lift their team over the Gauchos in the rivalry game.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos were unable to complete a late comeback against Irvine, Delson and co. were able to recover from an early deficit the night before against UCSD after trailing 23-19 in the first set.</p>\n<p>“San Diego is a tough young team,” said Gauchos assistant coach Cullen Irons. “[Kevin Ring] is a great coach, and he gave their team a great chance to get the win. But our guys came from behind to win the first set and closed out the next two pretty handily.</p>\n<p>The Tritons relied heavily on their underclassmen, playing four sophomores and a freshman in all three sets. The more experienced Gaucho roster made quick work of the young squad, led by Delson and opposite Matt Marsh, who each registered 12 and 10 kills respectively.</p>\n<p>Saturday night, UCSB’s five-game win streak was ended by reigning MPSF champs Irvine. The matchup was the Gauchos’ third game against top-10 teams early on in their grueling schedule.</p>\n<p>“They scouted us really well,” opposite Jacob Delson said. “It was really tough to put a ball away against them because it felt like their block was digging everything. They passed really well against our serves and they did a good job while we didn’t have a lot of fight in us.</p>\n<p>The junior found life hard in the 3-1 loss (19-25, 21-25, 25-22, 22-25), and was self-critical after posting a season-low four kills.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t play that well and we regrouped a little too late in the third. It’s tough when that happens,” Delson said.</p>\n<p>Irons credited the loss to an overall lapse in energy from his team, rather than any individual player, though.</p>\n<p>“Coming off of a win, it’s hard to maintain that focus and that ‘do whatever it takes’ mentality. I just think the guys got a little too relaxed,” he said.</p>\n<p>The assistant coach also said the coaching staff would be putting more emphasis on blocking and serving following the Irvine loss in preparation for next weekend’s upcoming games at USC and Cal Baptist.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67469\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/no-13-ucsb-handles-ucsd-outmatched-by-no-4-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67469\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/no-13-ucsb-handles-ucsd-outmatched-by-no-4-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/no-13-ucsb-handles-ucsd-outmatched-by-no-4-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/no-13-ucsb-handles-ucsd-outmatched-by-no-4-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/no-13-ucsb-handles-ucsd-outmatched-by-no-4-irvine/","id":5054,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5053,5052,5051],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 4 UCSB Prepared for First Two MPSF Clashes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"MPSF play kicks off this weekend as the No. 8 UCSB men's volleyball team prepares to play UCSD and No. 4 UC Irvine.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67356\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67356\" data-attachment-id=\"67356\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-volleyball-5/connor-drake-jump-serves-the-ball-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Connor Drake jump serves the ball.

After finishing the 2015 regular season in sixth place in the MPSF (17-10 overall, 13-9 conference), the Gauchos are preparing for a run at the league’s giants come the end of the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are fresh off a solid weekend performance at the UCSB Asics Invitational.<br>\n“We want to carry over our momentum from the past four games,” senior setter Jonah Seif said. “We need to keep playing together as a team, to be as consistent as possible and not have so many ups and downs.”</p>\n<p>After struggling to find their footing in the tournament opener against Quincy, dropping a pair of sets after jumping out to a 2-0 lead, the Gauchos went on to win the remaining seven sets to secure a perfect 3-0 on the weekend. In the narrow win over Quincy, redshirt freshman duo Connor Drake and Henri Cherry made their claims for more playing time with their game-changing performances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s tough coming in for your first couple games and I thought they responded great,” Seif said. “Both of them put up big numbers on Friday.

The redshirt senior finished last season eleventh in the nation in blocks per set with 1.18.</p>\n<p>Hardy’s return will welcome back the team’s best blocker and a major offensive threat into the starting lineup against a potent UCI squad. The Anteaters ended last year ranked third in the nation and won the MPSF with a 19-3 record in conference play, including a pair of wins against UCSB.</p>\n<p>“[Irvine] plays a bunch of lineups in preseason so it’s tough to know who will be out there, but I think we match up against every team,” Seif said. “We have a big team and a lot of experience, so I think we’ll match up fine.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ other opponent this weekend, UC San Diego, struggled to compete with the other teams in the loaded conference. Santa Barbara will look to continue its five-game win streak against the Tritons. UCSB has won in straight sets in every match during that streak.</p>\n<p>Following a successful preseason featuring an impressive 3-1 dispatching of perennial national championship contender Loyola (Ill.) as well as a perfect record at the Gauchos’ annual invitational, Santa Barbara will look to continue these types of performances against MPSF sides, beginning this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-volleyball-5/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-volleyball-5/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-volleyball-5/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-volleyball-5/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-volleyball-5/","id":5053,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5052,5051,5050],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"McLaughlin Hits 100 Wins, Gauchos Go Undefeated at Asics Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's volleyball team goes 3-0 over the weekend to give Head Coach Rick McLaughlin his 100th win with the program.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67276\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67276\" data-attachment-id=\"67276\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/mclaughlin-hits-100-wins-gauchos-go-undefeated-at-asics-invitational/mvball_vsnjit-20160108-dustinharris-7-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Corey Chavers and Hayden Boehle both lean in to pass the ball.

Against Quincy, Delson tied his season high in kills with 16, and Seif posted a season high 48 assists.</p>\n<p>The tournament opener, however, was the Gauchos’ closest match of the weekend. After jumping out to a quick 2-0 lead, fortunes tilted in the Hawks’ favor, although the home team was able to squeak out a close 5-set victory.</p>\n<p>“Against Quincy, we were up 2-0, got complacent and before we knew it we were in a fifth game,” McLaughlin said. “The biggest thing is staying focused mentally for the entire match.”</p>\n<p>The players felt the same way going into the fifth set and were confident that they would be able to turn things around.</p>\n<p>“After the fourth set we told each other that we have to win this game,” said opposite Matt Marsh. “We’re the better team so we have to figure this out. Luckily we came out with energy.”</p>\n<p>Marsh, a redshirt junior, missed the vast majority of last year due to injury, and is having a breakout year since returning. He has registered 59 kills thus far this season, second on the team behind Delson. Against NJIT, Marsh hit for a career high 16 kills on an astonishingly efficient .591 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>In addition to the explosive Marsh-Delson combo, UCSB received a timely boost from redshirt freshmen duo Connor Drake and Henri Cherry, who made their competitive debuts for the Gauchos in the Quincy game. The two split time at middle blocker and each played in every set of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“It’s early in the season and we have some guys who are just starting to get their feet wet out there and they’re learning fast,” said coach McLaughlin.</p>\n<p>The pair tallied 36 kills in the three matches, providing a nice offensive supplement to the leading upperclassmen. Despite the minimal experience that Drake and Cherry have, they will be tasked with anchoring the middle of the court for UCSB entering league play.</p>\n<p>“The next string of games we’re starting actual league, so we’re competitive and ready to take on any team,” said Marsh.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos travel south for their first league game of the season this weekend against UC San Diego, followed by another non-conference clash with rival UC Irvine.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67293\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/mclaughlin-hits-100-wins-gauchos-go-undefeated-at-asics-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67293\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/mclaughlin-hits-100-wins-gauchos-go-undefeated-at-asics-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/mclaughlin-hits-100-wins-gauchos-go-undefeated-at-asics-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/mclaughlin-hits-100-wins-gauchos-go-undefeated-at-asics-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/mclaughlin-hits-100-wins-gauchos-go-undefeated-at-asics-invitational/","id":5052,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5051,5050,5049],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB to Host 51st Annual Asics Invitational, Slate of Non-Conference Opponents Awaits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_021-FILEPHOTO-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_021-FILEPHOTO-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After a huge 3-1 road victory over reigning national champion Loyola (Illinois) last Sunday, the UCSB men's volleyball team looks to use it momentum in its home opener.

In its contest the next day, Santa Barbara defeated reigning champions Loyola by the same score.</p>\n<p>The players are looking forward to playing against another set of tough teams following their visits to Loyola and Lewis and continue to adjust to life without last year’s senior class, led by Kevin Donohue and Weston Nielsen. The two were first and second, respectively in kills, tallying totals of 331 and 238 apiece.</p>\n<p>“We want to win all three games, but the main objective is getting better,” junior outside hitter Jacob Delson said. “The more touches we have on the ball and the more time we spend together as a team, the better we will be for season.”</p>\n<p>Delson is returning as one of the leaders for this season’s squad. He totaled the third most kills with 214 last year, the most among returning players. In two matches this year, he is averaging 15.0 kills and 5.5 digs.</p>\n<p>Despite losing several key seniors, UCSB will be led by Delson, redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh, and senior setter Jonah Seif. Marsh, in the first two matches this season, is second on the team with 24 kills. Seif was named to the AVCA All-American Second Team last year, tallying 967 assists, and is off to a similar start this year with 76 in two games.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, a lot of guys will see the floor this weekend,” McLaughlin said. “Our program is a constant competitive environment and it could always be a different team out there from one week to the next.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were ranked no. 9 in last year’s Coaches Poll, and with a lineup that McLaughlin says is “very capable of taking the floor and being successful,” they are confident that they can finish atop the rankings come May.</p>\n<p>“Your goal, always, is to be number one,” McLaughlin said. “That’s what the team’s shooting for and I think we’ve got a shot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s quest for the national crown continues in Rob Gym with a Friday doubleheader on Jan. 8 against Quincy at 10:00 a.m. and NJIT at 7:00 p.m. The Gauchos’ busy week ends with their matchup versus Sacred Heart on Saturday, Jan. 9 at 6:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67219\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67219\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/","id":5050,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5049,5048,5047],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Swept in Season Finale at UCI, Finish Season with Program-Lows in Overall and Conf.

UCSB ended the year with a 7-20 overall record, its first time not recording double-figure wins in a season to go along with its 3-13 Big West record.</p>\n<p>Ending its season with three-straight home matches, UCI’s sweep of Santa Barbara earned itself a tie for fifth-place with Cal State Northridge. The Anteaters closed the year with a 13-15 overall and 7-9 Big West record.</p>\n<p>A matchup that ended with a two-point differential in the final three sets in the first meeting between these two teams, it was a similar ending in the match’s first set on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>It was a slow start for both teams as they were plagued by 10 errors apiece. UCSB earned a .026 hitting percentage in the opening set while Irvine had a .000 attacking percentage.</p>\n<p>Despite the sluggish start, UCSB managed to begin the match with a 4-1 run but could not hold off the Anteaters’ comeback effort. Down 5-7, a kill by junior setter Shelley Anderson ignited Irvine’s 8-0 run to help it take a 13-7 lead. However, the Gauchos responded with a 6-1 run of their own to cut the Anteaters’ lead to one at 13-14.</p>\n<p>A pivotal component within Santa Barbara’s trimming of UCI’s lead was senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva. Playing in her last match as a Gaucho, Villanueva registered four of her eight kills in the first set. Complementing the play of Villanueva was junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield as she registered a team-high nine kills.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB was able to come as close as one-point within UCI’s lead, the Gauchos could never tie or regain the lead as both teams traded points to close out the set. Three of Santa Barbara’s last four points came off of UCI errors and nearly forced an extra points finish but a kill by redshirt senior middle blocker Ella Rosenfeld secured Irvine’s 25-23 win for the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>A combination of kills and UCI errors helped UCSB to take an early 8-4 lead to start the second set but the Gauchos failed to maintain their momentum as it concluded the set with a -.025 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>While UCSB struggled to establish its hitting stroke, Irvine gradually improved, recording a .265 hitting clip and eventually went on an 8-0 run to go up 14-9 and force a UCSB timeout. The Anteaters’ scoring rally transferred into a latter 6-1 run to close the second set with its 25-14 victory as well as extended their lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s .206 attacking percentage, Irvine’s offense performed best in the third set recording a .400 hitting clip. Leading the Anteaters’ offensive surge was freshman opposite Harlee Kekaauoha.</p>\n<p>After recording just six kills in limited playing time in the team’s first contest against the Gauchos, she was most clutch in the last set, notching six of her match-high 10 kills in addition to a tied match-high of 12 digs.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ trend of playing from behind continued in the final set with UCSB taking a 4-2 lead but UCI’s consistency of scoring runs continued as it went on an 8-1 run to take a 10-5 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to answer with a 4-0 run of its own and trailed by one, 9-10. However, Santa Barbara could not overcome this one-point margin.

They definitely had us beat in some positions with some size and that’s why you’ve got to take speed and quickness and beat them that way. We weren’t efficient enough.”</p>\n<p>The road trip to Santa Barbara was the Rainbow Wahine’s last match of the season. This year’s Big West Champions, Hawai’i finished with an undefeated conference record of 16-0 and will enter the NCAA Tournament with a 26-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>It will also enter the postseason with a 21-match win streak, its longest since winning 26-straight in 2011. Hawaii’s win over UCSB in straight sets was its third consecutive sweep of a team and its 16<sup>th</sup> sweep of the season.</p>\n<p>With great size, not only did Hawai’i dominate at the net but it also had a powerful attack. The Rainbow Wahine established an aggressive swing on the ball early in the match, recording a .393 hitting clip in the first set.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara showed signs of being able to defend Hawaii’s attack as it trailed 4-5. However, it was up until this point that Hawaii’s 5-0 run would increase its lead to 10-4, forcing a UCSB timeout. The Rainbow Wahine’s largest lead was 11 points and eventually resulted in them taking a 1-0 lead with a 25-16 win in the first set.</p>\n<p>Leading Hawai’i on the offensive end was junior opposite Nikki Taylor. Although she tallied a match-high 11 kills, she finished with a .111 hitting percentage, her third lowest in a match this season.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did some really good things out there,” Lantagne Welch said. “We passed well, we had a few big hitters. We held their best player [Taylor], she struggled tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to contain Taylor was most effective in the second set as it held Hawai’i to a .069 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Still, a -.156 hitting percentage and 12 errors plagued Santa Barbara in the set, allowing Hawai’i to capitalize on the Gauchos’ mistakes to take a 6-0 lead. Able to extend their lead to 20-9, it seemed like the Rainbow Wahine were destined to earn a blowout set victory.</p>\n<p>Despite the 11-point deficit, the Gauchos responded with a 6-2 run to trim Hawaii’s lead to 22-15. Senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva finished with a team-high seven kills. In spite of UCSB’s comeback effort, Hawai’i built upon its lead with a kill by Taylor and a block to earn the set-point lead at 24-15.</p>\n<p>But a 5-0 scoring run helped Santa Barbara to delay Hawaii’s pursuit of taking a 2-0 lead, causing the Rainbow Wahine to call a timeout. However, another kill by Taylor and a block by sophomore middle blocker Emily Maglio and sophomore setter Kendra Koelsch secured Hawaii’s 25-21 win.</p>\n<p>Another commanding start highlighted the Rainbow Wahine’s opening of the third set as they took an 8-2 lead, leading to a Gauchos’ timeout. While both teams traded points, UCSB could never overcome Hawaii’s lead and were forced to call a second timeout while down by a score of 13-20.</p>\n<p>Helping spark Santa Barbara’s last chance at avoiding being swept was freshman outside hitter Devin Joos as her kill ignited the Gauchos’ 5-0 run to cut Hawaii’s lead to three at 18-21. Joos and junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt both registered six kills and both recorded a .308 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>However, the momentum remained with Hawai’i as it needed four points to end the match. Earning these last four points was no challenge as the Rainbow Wahine ended the third set with a .500 hitting percentage to take the 25-19 win to close the match.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will end its season on Tuesday, Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> as it will face UC Irvine at 7:00 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66702\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66702\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/","id":5049,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5048,5047,5046],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Searching for Upset of No. 8 Hawai’i on Senior Night, Will Face UCI to Close Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos close out their season with a pair of matches this weekend including their home season finale against Hawaii.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the first time in program history, the UCSB women’s volleyball team will finish a season without double-figure wins.

Just to play as hard as we can and have fun.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will end its season on the road, facing UC Irvine next Tuesday. After being swept by Hawaii, the Anteaters are 12-14 overall, 6-8 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began its conference schedule against Hawaii which resulted in a 3-0 sweep of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With its sweep of UC Irvine on Tuesday, the Rainbow Wahine clinched the Big West Conference title outright. Hawaii is currently the only Big West team with an undefeated conference record at 13-0 and is 23-1 overall.</p>\n<p>Its third conference title in the past four years, Hawaii earned its eighth Big West and 24th overall conference title. Since its 3-1 loss to No. 11 UCLA on Sept. 6, Hawaii has been the epitome of a championship caliber team. The Rainbow Wahine currently possess a 18-match winning streak, their longest since winning 19 straight in 2012.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s success this season is no coincidence as it has been one of the best defensive teams in the country. The Rainbow Wahine led the nation in blocks per set with a 3.37 average. Continuously stifling offenses, Hawaii’s .143 opponent hitting percentage ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>With statistical rankings atop the nation, it’s no coincidence that Hawaii has dominated nearly every statistical category within the Big West.</p>\n<p>Conference leads in hitting percentage (.287), blocks (3.37), kills per set (14.05), service aces per set (1.52) and opponent hitting percentage (.143). A total of three Hawaii players rank within the top five statistical leaders in hitting percentage, blocks per set and services aces per set.</p>\n<p>While no team revolves around one individual, junior opposite Nikki Taylor has been the Rainbow Wahine’s best player.</p>\n<p>The fourth player in Hawaii history to earn four Big West Player of the Week honors, the reigning conference Offensive Player of the Week has registered at least 20 kills in three of the team’s last four matches. Her averages of 4.36 kills per set and 0.44 service aces per set lead the conference while she ranks third in blocks per set with a 1.24 average.</p>\n<p>Although the odds do not favor UCSB, the combination of playing on its home court and motivation from the occasion give the Gauchos a chance to compete versus the Big West’s best.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be aggressive,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’re going to have a big size disadvantage against Hawaii but we still have to find a way to use that to our advantage. Making sure that we get our hands on the block and that there’s no tentativeness in our play.”</p>\n<p>Helping establish UCSB’s aggressiveness is freshman libero Emilia Petrachi. Due to UCSB’s lack of size, the Gauchos’ front row defense may not earn many blocks, leaving many dig opportunities for Petrachi. She recently earned her second Big West Freshman of the Week award after 20-plus back-to-back dig performances last weekend.</p>\n<p>Another chance to avenge a loss in the first meeting presents itself in the Gauchos’ rematch against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite Santa Barbara tying the match 1-1 after two sets, the Anteaters managed to earn a 3-1 victory. Close finishes in the final two sets, back-to-back 25-23 set victories, allowed UCI to edge UCSB for the win.</p>\n<p>“The Irvine match was very recent,” Lantagne Welch said. “We had three two-point sets with them. All we needed was a point here and a point there, and that match is a different story.”</p>\n<p>It was expected that freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha, the team’s leader in kills (318), would be the leading force in Irvine’s attack against the Gauchos. However, redshirt senior outside hitter Marisa Bubica carried the Anteaters to victory with a match-high 19 kills and finished with a .341 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Wins to end the season would be an encouraging finish for a team that has struggled to meet its expectations. But as the collegiate careers of five seniors come to an end, the journey of the players is most rewarding.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big deal,” Lantagne Welch said. “Seniors grow and progress throughout their careers. It’s a special moment, seeing them come along not only as volleyball players but people.”</p>\n<p>The Senior Night matchup versus Hawaii will begin at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 21 in the Thunderdome. UCSB’s last match of the season on Tuesday, Nov. 24 at UC Irvine will start at 7:00 p.m. and will be played at Crawford Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66605\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66605\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/","id":5089,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5088,5087,5086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Season Series Versus CSUF, Split with UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-1 win over Cal State Fullerton on Friday ended the UCSB women's volleyball team's five-match losing slump.

The 3-0 victory was the team’s second sweep of the season, creating another UCR record.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s quick start to open the match against CSUF led to it maintaining the lead throughout the entirety of the first set. An early 4-0 scoring run handed the Gauchos an 8-3 lead but would be trimmed as the Titans answered back with a 4-1 run of their own to pull within two at 7-9.</p>\n<p>Having the best season in her collegiate career, Grunt’s surge of three consecutive kills helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 13-7. Her 13 kills matched a season-high in attacks to go along with a .346 hitting clip. Grunt was the only Gaucho to record a solo block.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the first set with a .368 hitting percentage, holding Fullerton to a .135 clip for the 25-15 victory and 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Fullerton slowed down UCSB’s attack to a .286 hitting percentage in the second set and took an early 5-2 lead. But the Titans’ short stint of scores did not last long as they could not surpass the Gauchos’ defensive prowess.</p>\n<p>In addition to CSUF’s six errors, Santa Barbara allowed just seven kills to hold the Titans to a .028 hitting percentage. The Gauchos’ 76 digs were their second-most in a match this season. Leading UCSB in defensive scoops was freshman libero Emilia Petrachi with a match-high 26.</p>\n<p>Exchanges of scoring runs between the two teams resulted in Fullerton taking a 13-10 lead, ensuing a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the timeout was a reinvigorated Santa Barbara team as it achieved a 4-0 scoring rally of its own to force a CSUF timeout. But the Gauchos’ dominance persisted, extending into an 11-1 run that put them up 21-14 and eventually led to a 25-19 set victory.</p>\n<p>Five of Grunt’s 13 kills appeared during the set while UCSB notched four of its nine service aces as well, the total being its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>CSUF countered with an outstanding .448 hitting percentage in the third set. Most notably, Fullerton never trailed as it had 13 kills and zero errors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Katelyn Nielsen provided the spark to the Titans’ 16-5 run, tallying an individual 5-1 scoring run. She finished with a career-high 13 kills and helped lead Fullerton to its 25-14 win to cut the Gauchos’ lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>But Nielsen’s breakout performance was not enough to prevent UCSB from taking a 25-17 win in the final set for the 3-1 victory. UCSB’s .371 hitting percentage to end the match was its highest for the evening. Another four aces would appear as Sheffield had a match-high three.</p>\n<p>While neither team hit over a .300 clip in any set of Saturday’s match, UC Riverside’s offense was just enough to edge UCSB, specifically in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Villanueva registered another double digit hitting performance with 12 kills but was outperformed by the excellent attack of UCR’s senior outside hitter Helena Peric. She recorded a match-high 18 kills for the fourth time this season to lead Riverside to its 3-0 sweep of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Hawai’i next Saturday, Nov. 14<sup>th</sup> in its last home match of the season. It will also be the team’s senior night in which five players will be honored.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/","id":5088,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5087,5086,5085],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Confident Heading into Rematches After Success Earlier in Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Two weeks remain on the schedule for the UCSB women's volleyball team.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB looks to improve its 6-17 overall, 2-10 conference record. Despite earning victories over the Titans and Highlanders in previous meetings earlier this season, the Gauchos have struggled when playing on the road and are 1-6 in away matches.</p>\n<p>The troubles for Fullerton continue to pile up as it remains winless this season. CSUF is 0-24 overall and 0-12 in conference play. Dating back to the end of last season, the Titans are now on a 27-match losing streak.</p>\n<p>Still performing at a high level for the Titans is junior outside hitter Paige Reed. Overall, she ranks fifth in the Big West in digs per set with a 3.95 average. Since the start of conference play, she has moved up to fourth place, averaging 4.26 digs per set. She leads Fullerton in digs with 179.</p>\n<p>With regard to teams getting better, the gradual improvements throughout UCR’s season have resulted in some historical highlights for the Highlanders, who are 9-16 overall and 4-8 in conference matches. For just the fifth time in program history, Riverside won back-to-back Big West matches with their five set victory over Cal State Northridge and sweep of CSUF last weekend. Its nine overall wins is its most since 2005.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the sweep of Northridge handed UCR its fourth conference win of the season, tying its program record for Big West wins.</p>\n<p>Despite earning the 3-1 victory, Santa Barbara’s offense seemed to be a little disheveled by the Highlanders’ defense, having finished the match with a .152 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>“We need consistency,” Lantagne Welch said. “A lot of that stems from our serve-receive and our passing. Riverside is a really good defensive team. We’ll be more ready for that this time. If we’re passing the ball well, we’re going to have opportunities to score.”</p>\n<p>Improvements on the defensive end will be important for UCSB as well in hopes of containing the Highlanders’ senior outside hitter Helena Peric.</p>\n<p>She recently earned Big West Offensive Player of the Week honors after a phenomenal performance against CSUN. She tallied a career-high 23 kills and had 12 digs for her second double-double of the season to go along with a .308 hitting percentage. She continued her dominance with 15 kills, six digs, two service aces and a .379 hitting clip against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ containment begins at the net, a component of their defense in which they have excelled.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s average of 2.10 blocks per set ranks third overall in the Big West. In three of its last four matches, UCSB has registered double-digit blocking totals. The centerpieces to the Gauchos’ denial at the net are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield.</p>\n<p>They both rank within the top 10 overall of the Big West rankings in blocks per set and total blocks. Sheffield holds the team lead in both statistical categories with 82 blocks and a 0.95 blocks per set average while Grunt is second with 78 blocks and a 0.91 average.</p>\n<p>While UCSB was unable to find much success offensively in its first match versus UCR, it did respond with a .302 hitting night against Cal State Fullerton the following night. The Gauchos’ confidence helped carry them to a strong attack but they must find that same determination when they are out of sync as well.</p>\n<p>“It comes and goes,” Lantagne Welch said. “When we’re doing well, we’re very confident. When we struggle, we lose it too quickly. That’s something about getting tougher in that scenario and knowing that teams are going to make big plays and we’re going to mess up some. That’s okay, it’s just we need to respond right away.”</p>\n<p>ESPN3 will nationally broadcast the match between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton this Friday, Nov. 13th at 4:30 p.m. The Gauchos will bring their weekend to a close at UC Riverside on Saturday, Nov. 14th at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/","id":5082,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5081,5080,5079],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Inability to Close Sets Leaves Gauchos Frustrated with Losses to UCI & UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Unable to overcome its struggles in tight sets, the UCSB women's volleyball team encountered a 3-1 loss to UC Irvine on Saturday and was swept by UC Davis on Friday.

The Gauchos are now 6-17 overall and 2-10 in the Big West. Saturday’s victory brings UC Irvine within one win from achieving a .500 record. The Anteaters sit at 12-13, 6-7 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Also just one win away from the neutral winning percentage mark is UC Davis. Arguably its most impressive win of the season, UC Davis is now 13-14 overall, 8-5 in Big West matches after a 3-2 upset over Cal Poly on Saturday and its win over UCSB on Friday.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think the upperclassmen, me and the seniors, need to step it up,” junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt said. “We need to tell the team ‘this is what we’re going to do and this is how we’re going to do it.’ It’s been a long season but we still have games to go. We can make a change at this point, there’s no reason we can’t step it up.”</p>\n<p>From the match’s beginning, UC Irvine was able to establish its dominance on the offensive end. It opened the first set with a 6-1 lead, forcing a UCSB timeout. The Anteaters took an even more comfortable lead at 17-7, causing another Gauchos’ timeout.</p>\n<p>While UCSB and UCI would go on to exchange points, the Anteaters’ .379 hitting percentage proved to be too much for the Gauchos’ defense.</p>\n<p>After a dismal .000 hitting percentage in the first set, UCSB bounced back with its best attacking performance in the second set. The Gauchos tallied 16 kills to go along with a .316 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s commanding start helped it gain a 12-9 lead but a 5-0 Anteaters’ run led to UC Irvine taking a 14-12 lead. However, the Gauchos responded with a 6-0 run of their own.</p>\n<p>Sparking the Gauchos’ run was the outstanding serving of senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva. Her four consecutive service aces helped give UCSB its 18-14 lead. Villanueva finished with a team-high 11 kills and had 10 digs.</p>\n<p>Adding to Villanueva’s match-high of four aces was Grunt and freshman outside hitter Devin Joos. Grunt led UCSB with a .389 hitting percentage and clocked four of her eight kills in the second set. In spite of her .156 hitting clip, Joos registered nine kills but was most valuable on defense with a match-high three solo blocks.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sustained its lead but not free of pressure from Irvine’s attempt to take the 2-0 lead. Able to force the 23-23 tie, a service error by sophomore setter Emily Blair and an attack error by redshirt senior outside hitter Marisa Bubica allowed the Gauchos to seal the set for the 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>The attacking error was certainly a mistake that Bubica did not forget entering the third set. Although both teams hit poorly in the set, Bubica had nine of her match-high 19 kills in the third set.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCI’s defense played more efficiently in the second half. In spite of being outblocked, Irvine’s 72 digs was its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>Twice did UCSB pull within a one-point deficit but could not capitalize on Irvine’s errors. Earning the Anteaters’ last two kills to take the 25-23 set victory and a 2-1 lead was redshirt sophomore opposite Lena Latour.</p>\n<p>It was a similar scenario in the final set as well. Trailing 6-5, UCSB found some separation with a 5-0 run to take a 10-6 lead and force a UCI timeout.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly after 18 kills the previous night against Cal Poly, freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha was not in the Anteaters’ starting lineup and did not enter the match until being used as a substitution in the fourth period.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s leader in kills with 307 and kills per set with a 3.34 average, Kekeauoha was perfect despite limited playing time. She finished with six kills on six attempts.</p>\n<p>Irvine trimmed UCSB’s lead and as the match progressed, took a 17-16 lead. Back and forth scoring occurred between both teams, but it seemed like the Gauchos were on their way to victory with a 22-20 lead. But a service error by Villanueva trimmed UCSB’s lead to one and provided UCI with its comeback opportunity. Irvine closed the match with a 5-2 run to earn its 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s troubles on offense stemmed from its .154 hitting clip the night before versus UC Davis. While Santa Barbara contained UC Davis’ senior outside hitter Kaylin Squyres to five kills and a .103 hitting clip in the first meeting, the Gauchos were unsuccessful in their attempt of a repeat performance on Friday.</p>\n<p>She finished with a match-high 13 kills, 14 digs, and a .379 attacking percentage. Junior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht finished with 10 kills and a .310 hitting average.</p>\n<p>Villanueva led UCSB with 10 kills but was the only Gaucho in double digit figures. It was her third consecutive match with double digit kills but was not enough to prevent the Gauchos from being swept.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road next Friday, Nov. 13<sup>th</sup> at Cal State Fullerton for a primetime matchup on ESPN3 at 4:30 p.m. The Gauchos’ weekend continues with a Saturday match at UC Riverside at 7:30 p.m. Santa Barbara’s two conference wins appeared in home matches against both teams earlier this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66268\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66268\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/","id":5081,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5080,5079,5078],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Not Willing to Concede as Season Winds Down","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CamerynBrock-WVolleyball-8-of-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CamerynBrock-WVolleyball-8-of-20-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With just six matches remaining this season, the UCSB women's volleyball team attempts to find its footing in a adversity stricken season.

UC Davis enters the Thunderdome with an overall record of 11-14 and 6-5 in conference matches. Saturday will be the first time UCSB and UC Irvine face each other this season. The two teams split last year’s season series with Irvine winning the first match 3-2 and UCSB redeeming itself with a 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite limiting star senior outside hitter Kaylin Squyres to five kills and a .103 hitting clip in its first meeting against the Aggies, UCSB was unable to contain Davis’ offense, which hit over .300 in the match’s first two sets. Since the start of conference play, Davis ranks second in the Big West with 540 kills, 514 assists and 648 digs.</p>\n<p>Filling in for the absence of Squyres in that first meeting was junior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht. She was the only player to achieve double digit kills with 17. Walbrecht ranks second on the team with a total of 234 kills and a 2.52 kills per set average.</p>\n<p>Still, as the conference leader with 406 kills and a kills per set average of 4.37, containing Squyres is not a guaranteed outcome. Prior to the Aggies’ recent loss to Long Beach State this past Saturday, Squyres tied a 25-year-old school record with eight service aces in a five-set victory over Cal State Northridge on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“We just need to know that a lot of balls are going to go to the outside,” Lantagne Welch said. “We’ve got to be really clean with our defense through six rotations, not just three. We have to do a better job consistently throughout a match of defending the left side.”</p>\n<p>UCSB may have found a hidden gem of its own at the outside hitter position in freshman Devin Joos. In spite of the loss to Cal Poly, Joos made the most of her opportunity in receiving more playing time in the front row. It is expected that after career-highs of 12 kills and a .258 hitting percentage that she will be a frequent asset in the Gauchos’ offensive attack.</p>\n<p>“She’s been a regular in our starting group for a little while now,” Lantagne Welch said. “She had an emerging game, and we just need her to keep being productive and keep contributing to the team.”</p>\n<p>Topping off the Gauchos‘ weekend is their match versus UC Irvine. It is not too common that a team faces a conference opponent for the first time this late in the season, but UCSB is optimistic about its chances.</p>\n<p>“We have tape on them as they [UC Irvine] do on us,” Lantagne Welch explained. “It’s kind of exciting to have that new, refreshing team to get to go after and see how you match up with. They have some dynamic players, and it’ll be a good battle. There’s some things that we’re working on to take to the Anteaters.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of what Santa Barbara’s strategy is heading into game day, certainly it will include a plan to try to prevent freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha from dominating. She leads the Anteaters with 283 kills, a 3.29 kills per set average, 28 service aces and 168 digs. Kekauoha has recorded an ace in the Anteaters’ last five matches.</p>\n<p>The versatile freshman recently earned her second Big West Freshman of the Week award this past Monday. In the Anteaters’ last two contests, Kekauoha tallied a total of 35 kills and a .460 attacking percentage. Within this impressive feat was a career-high 20-kill performance in Irvine’s sweep of CSUN this past Saturday. In 17 of the team’s 23 matches, Kekauoha has registered double digit kills.</p>\n<p>Assisting the play of Kekauoha is redshirt junior Victoria Dennis, in her breakout year. Entering the 2015 season, Dennis had a career total of 133 kills, which includes redshirting her sophomore year. She has had no issue with embracing a bigger role, however, ranking second on the team in kills with 241 and kills per set at 3.01.</p>\n<p>The pattern of the breakout year continues with UCSB junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt. In four of the team’s last six matches she has earned double digit kills. Grunt ranks fourth overall in the Big West in hitting percentage with a .344 average and has made a significant improvement since the start of conference play with the second-best hitting clip at .402 percent. Grunt is currently third on the Gauchos’ roster in kills with 139 and second in total blocks with 74.</p>\n<p>“She’s putting up big numbers, so teams are putting more attention on her to slow her down,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need more balance on our team and other people to put the ball away. She’s been very consistent for us. We just need her to stay aggressive and stay after it.”</p>\n<p>This weekend’s contests are two of UCSB’s last three home matches of the season. Santa Barbara’s rematch versus UC Davis on Friday, Nov. 6 will begin at 7:00 p.m. Its matchup versus UC Irvine follows on Saturday, Nov. 7 at 7:00 p.m. Both matches will take place in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/","id":5077,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5076,5075,5074],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":12,"route":"/categories/sports/volleyball","highestPage":32}},"__N_SSG":true}
