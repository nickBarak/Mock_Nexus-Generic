In January, legendary coach Kathy Gregory announced her retirement as UCSB’s head coach. On February 6, it was announced that former Miami women’s volleyball head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch would be stepping in to begin a new era of volleyball in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of great candidates and we had to make a very difficult decision, but [Nicole] has proven that she is a winner and has worked very hard at different schools,” Gregory said. “She was at Texas A&amp;M where she was a recruiter and she won and then went on to Miami, and everywhere she has gone she has proven that she can be successful.”</p>\n<p>Lantagne Welch began her coaching career at her alma mater, the University of Maryland, in 1994 as an assistant coach. She moved onto Ohio State in 1995 and then to Texas A&amp;M in 1997, where as an assistant she reached the NCAA tournament all three years she was there and made the elite eight in 1999.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In 2001 she became the head coach for Miami, where she took over the rebuilding process and restarted the volleyball program after 20 years without a team. In just her second season, Lantagne Welch led her squad to an NCAA Sweet 16 birth.</p>\n<p>In 12 years with the Hurricanes, Lantagne Welch made five NCAA tournaments, one Sweet 16 birth and left with a .669 winning percentage, a record of 243-120. In her last season, she led her team to the NCAA tournament with a 25-6 record and 17 wins in Miami’s Atlantic Coat Conference. Her successful season earned her the ACC Coach of the year and the AVCA East Region Coach of the Year awards.</p>\n<p>“It took a lot of hard work, there were a lot of great coaches that surrounded me over the years and a lot of great players,” Lantagne Welch said. “Recruiting is a huge part of success, getting the right student athlete to succeed in your system. We were known for running a very quick offense and being very athletic and those are some of the things I’m going to try and instill here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>While her talents as a leader and mentor will certainly be sorely missed in Miami, UCSB is happy to welcome her to the Gauchos for her coaching skills both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“I had a really great program at Miami where I was for the last 13 years and 12 seasons, and it was very special to me,” Lantagne Welch said. “There were actually only a couple jobs that I would have ever even considered or looked at and UCSB was one of them.”</p>\n<p>In 2012, five of her players were named as All-East Region players, but equally as impressive and valued here at UCSB is the success of her student athletes in the classroom. During her time with the Hurricanes, she saw a 100 percent graduation rate and in 2012, her players compiled a team GPA of 3.14.</p>\n<p>“She has a very good commitment to academics,” Gregory said. “She fits the mold of commitment to the school with high focus on academics and she is a proven hard worker, so it looks like, on paper, that this will be a great hire.”</p>\n<p>For Lantagne Welch, coming back to So Cal was an easy choice. A native of Encinitas, California, Welch had family ties that piqued her interest in coming to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“This is actually a dream job of mine,” Lantagne Welch said. “My parents were both born and raised in Santa Barbara and my grandfather worked at the university for years, so I have a lot of family connections. I am very familiar with Santa Barbara and UCSB. Plus it’s a great school with a great location and it’s a hotbed state for volleyball. So it’s a no-brainer in terms of a program you can get known nationally and compete at the highest levels.”</p>\n<p>Lantagne Welch takes over a Gauchos team that finished 16-17 last season with a 9-9 Big West Conference record. Though the season did not turn out as a great success, there were many bright spots for the team that should only be better with another year of experience.</p>\n<p>“We just had our full spring season and we are allowed six weeks of full training and we got to compete in four scrimmages,” Lantagne Welch said. “It was a really great time for us to work together. I think if you ask the players and our coaches, you’d hear that we took steps in the right direction. We are improving and we’re working things out.”</p>\n<p>This summer, the team will get together to begin play with a new coach and new system but in a familiar, yet still difficult, Big West Conference. The road will be trying for the Gauchos as they will have a tough schedule ahead of them with Hawaii, who were undefeated in the Big West last season, and the always competitive Long Beach State, who finished in second last season. However, Lantagne Welch remains confident in her team and their abilities moving forward.</p>\n<p>“We talked to the team about it when we started. It’s more of a new era, a new direction and we are taking our own path now wherever that takes us,” Lantagne Welch said. “You worry about what you can control. We have a schedule in front of us and we are going to prepare the best we can. What we can control is how hard we work and things we can improve on and the rest will show on the court.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Volleyball.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"892240059\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51412\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51413\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/nicole-lantange-welch-ready-to-lead-new-ucsb-dynasty/volleyball-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Volleyball.jpg?fit=900%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Volleyball\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Volleyball.jpg?fit=250%2C83&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Volleyball.jpg?fit=888%2C296&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51413\" alt=\"Volleyball\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Volleyball-250x83.jpg?resize=250%2C83\" width=\"250\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Volleyball.jpg?resize=250%2C83&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Volleyball.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 16, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of UCSB Athletics.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51412\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/nicole-lantange-welch-ready-to-lead-new-ucsb-dynasty/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51412\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/nicole-lantange-welch-ready-to-lead-new-ucsb-dynasty/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/nicole-lantange-welch-ready-to-lead-new-ucsb-dynasty/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/nicole-lantange-welch-ready-to-lead-new-ucsb-dynasty/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/nicole-lantange-welch-ready-to-lead-new-ucsb-dynasty/","id":5302,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5301,5300,5299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Davis Named National Blocker of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-111.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-111.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"After four years serving the UCSB men’s volleyball team, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis was honored this past week with the Off The Block/Springbak, Inc.

Despite the individual achievements, Davis still acknowledges the important role his teammates and coaching staff played this season.</p>\n<p>“They were absolutely everything; without them there’s no way I would’ve even come close to getting the numbers I did this year,” Davis said. “The coaching staff and the team — they’ve all been pushing me to be the best player I can be. I think I did that my senior year.”</p>\n<p>This is the second major honor bestowed on Davis this season. Earlier he was selected as an All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation first team selection, being one of only two middle blockers to be selected for the first team.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to be the best I could be and whatever came out of that I gladly accept,” Davis said. “These rewards mean a lot to me and I’m really glad I got them, but these weren’t something I was planning on from the get go.”</p>\n<p>This season alone Davis recorded double-digit kills on six occasions, including a season-high 14 kills against UC San Diego on Feb. 1. Davis had his most complete game of the season while on the road versus USC, where he put up a double-double with 11 kills, 14 blocks and a .500 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“Our win against USC — that was one of the games where we turned it around and got our win streak going,” Davis said. “That was one of the bigger games this year.”</p>\n<p>Although his collegiate career might have ended last week after the Gauchos lost to UC Irvine in the first round of the MPSF playoffs, his professional career is just beginning as he aspires to play professionally and for the national team in the Olympics. If he gets there, Davis will be the first one to thank the UCSB volleyball program for helping him get there.</p>\n<p>“Without these guys I don’t think I would’ve become the kind of person I am today, I really have to thank them for getting me out of my shell that I had when I came out of high school,” Davis said. “They all pushed me to be a better person. It’s a great program with a great group of guys.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Daniel Wade of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51041\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51041\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/","id":5301,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5300,5299,5298],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss to UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_006.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_006.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It seemed like 2011 was about to repeat itself.

Santa Barbara could not shake off its trouble on the road, finishing the season 4-10 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>After starting the season 3-9 in conference, the Gauchos posted a near-perfect record in March, including a seven-game winning streak to propel them into the seventh seed of the playoffs. However, Santa Barbara had a disappointing conclusion to its season and ended up losing four of its last five games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UC Irvine continues its run as the hottest team in the nation, extending its winning streak to six games. At 23-6 overall and 19-6 MPSF, the Anteaters seemed poised to reclaim the national title as they advance to the league semifinals against the third-seed Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB still has an outside chance of reaching the Final Four by earning the only at-large bid available, but their first round exit and overall record makes that possibility highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth first set ended up going to UC Irvine who had to fend off a resilient Gaucho attack to win the frame 26-24. UCSB responded as best they have the entire season, winning the second (25-22) and third set (25-20) to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite the lead, Irvine won the fourth set decisively 25-19 and built a five-point lead in fifth set, ultimately winning the final frame 15-10 and eliminating UCSB from the postseason.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht once again led the Gauchos in kills with 19, but Irvine was able to contain his offensive efficiency and limited Licht to a .205 hitting percentage. Licht added 10 digs and four blocks on defense.</p>\n<p>In his final game wearing the UCSB uniform, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis finished off his impressive career by recording six kills and four blocks. His 441 total blocks ranks third overall in program history.</p>\n<p>Irvine advances to the next round primarily on the play of junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. Tillie delivered on both ends of the court, finishing with 15 kills and seven digs. His three kills in the final set proved to be the difference as he delivered the final point of the match to send the Gauchos back home.</p>\n<p>The middle blocker tandem of juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring was effective in containing the Gaucho offense and held UCSB to a .213 hitting percentage for the game, compared to a .285 clip for the Anteaters. Kevorken and Mehring combined for 12 kills and 11 total blocks in the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have to fill the huge void left by Davis and its three other seniors, including outside hitter Miles Evans, but the remaining players can rely on the experience and chemistry established this year going forward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50974\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50974\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/","id":5307,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5306,5305,5304],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head to Irvine to Begin Postseason Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_001.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_001.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It’s one and done from here on out.

However, UCSB has evolved into a completely different team in the two month span since the last time these teams played.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht has turned into the go-to player for the Gauchos, recording double-digit kills in his final seven games of the season and leading the team in kills for much of that span. Having only made one total appearance as a substitute in both games against the Anteaters, Licht will add an extra dimension for UCSB’s offense.</p>\n<p>The game has added meaning for senior middle blocker Dylan Davis. In what quite possibly may be his final game of his collegiate career, Davis, the lone remaining starter from the team that reached the title game two years ago, has guided the team for much of the season and brings proven postseason experience to a relatively young squad.</p>\n<p>The team captain has delivered for the Gauchos throughout the season, posting 1.37 blocks per game and averaging a .438 hitting percentage, ranking third and sixth in the conference, respectively. In the first match against Irvine, Davis was forced to exit from the game early due to injury and could not play in the final crucial moments of the match.</p>\n<p>Sweeping five of its last seven opponents, UC Irvine enters the playoffs as the hottest team in the country and ready to repeat as champions. With the best middle blocker tandem in the league, juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring, Irvine is second in the MPSF in opponent hitting percentage (.238). Kevorken and Mehring come in with a .506 and .484 hitting percentage, respectively.</p>\n<p>If that was not enough to contain for the Gauchos, they will also have to account for AVCA National Player of the Year, junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. This year, the Frenchman has averaged 3.83 kills per set and had a total of 32 kills in seven total sets against the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/","id":5300,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5299,5298,5297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stepping Up When it Matters Most","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"If you thought the only underdogs winning in college were in basketball, think again.

His 437 total blocks throughout his career ranks third all-time in program history. However, what you don’t see is Davis’ significance to the young team inside the locker room.</p>\n<p>“He’s been a great leader; he’s our captain and he’s gotten these guys to push every day in practice and really set their goals, and really work towards them,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “That wasn’t an easy thing to do when we were 3-9 in league and he kept going and kept to the task, and now we’re [11-13] in league and we’re in the playoffs.”</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Davis was thrust onto volleyball’s biggest stage with six seniors starting alongside him and despite losing in the title game against Ohio State, that experience has been invaluable in shaping Davis’ role as team captain this year.</p>\n<p>“Being one of the only guys left on the team that was able to experience [the NCAA Final Four], I realize that I have to bring a kind of leadership to this team and just be the most complete player I possibly can,” Davis said. “And just allow the other players to build off of it [and] gain their own confidence … That’s pretty much been my own goal.”</p>\n<p>Sneaking into the MPSF playoffs as a No. 7 seed in 2011, the Gauchos went on an improbable run, defeating the No. 2, No. 6 and top overall seed USC en route to capturing the conference title and ultimately losing the national title game in five sets. Yet, perhaps no game in that incredible run was more significant to Davis than the national semifinal rematch versus USC.</p>\n<p>On the game’s biggest stage, Davis picked the right occasion for his coming-out party. In the match, Davis recorded 15 kills and a NCAA tournament record .882 hitting percentage, leading his team to the championship game and marking the beginning of Davis’ transition to being the leader he is now for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It gave me confidence in that I could compete with anybody on the other side,” Davis said. “I knew that the way I played was going to be the way I dictated my season and that game — having one of the best games of my career, really taught me I can hang with whomever.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing back in 2011, Davis has used the loss to fuel him to get his current team to where he wants them to be as they prepare to make their first postseason appearance after missing out last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it gives him the desire to get back there and win it,” McLaughlin said. “We had a tough loss back there two years ago and I think that just makes Dylan even hungrier to get this team on the same page so we can get back there and win it.”</p>\n<p>Entering the season with a roster consisting of only three seniors, Davis had the responsibility of leading a very young team through the toughest conference in collegiate volleyball. Yet, the team has responded to Davis’ style of leadership and he has embraced his role of team captain and all the pressures that come along with it.</p>\n<p>“There are guys that look up to you. You have to always be ready to play. You can’t have an off day. You’re going to be the guy that everyone looks up to in the end,” Davis said. “It’s just one of those situations where you have to be confident and be sure of yourself that you’re going to handle that pressure of people expecting so much of you.”</p>\n<p>Now a senior and playing in his final opportunity to win a national championship, Davis understands the potential this team has developed over the course of the season and is confident his team can make a run like they did when he was just a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is starting to click and it couldn’t have come at a better time right now,” Davis said. “I have high hopes for the end of the season and we just got to keep it going … I don’t want it to stop; I don’t want the end to come soon.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB will have to play on the road in the first round of the playoffs against UC Irvine on Saturday, the Gauchos still have a little magic on their side in Davis, and we all know what happened last time he entered the playoffs as an underdog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Daniel Wade of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/","id":5299,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5298,5297,5296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Season Finale to Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Senior night had no happy ending for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team.

The two applied pressure on the Gaucho defense throughout the match.</p>\n<p>In his final regular season game at home, Davis led the way for the Gauchos with an impressive stat line of 10 kills, four digs and a .571 hitting percentage. Junior opposite Evan Licht continues his excellent play and had a career-high 23 kills for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Despite ending the season on a loss, the season is still not over for the Gauchos. Next for Santa Barbara will be a road playoff game in the quarterfinals against Irvine with the winner advancing to the next stage of the MPSF tournament. The game is scheduled for Saturday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/","id":5324,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5323,5322,5321],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Captures Crucial Victory Over USC","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M-Volleyball_Mark-Brocher_for-04.12.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M-Volleyball_Mark-Brocher_for-04.12.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It wasn’t pretty, but it was a still a win for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team.

Currently in the eighth slot in the conference, Santa Barbara continues its success at home and improves to an 11-5 record at the Thunderdome. More significantly, the win keeps UCSB’s hopes alive of getting a higher seed in the playoffs with just one game remaining in the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out aggressively in the first set and had a commanding lead, taking care of business despite USC making a late run in the game to make things interesting. Nevertheless, Santa Barbara won 25-23.</p>\n<p>With Southern Cal having only a .156 hitting percentage in the second frame, Santa Barbara exploited the Trojan defense and went various runs throughout the set. The Gauchos took a 2-0 advantage by beating USC 25-19.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the third set 25-21, the Gauchos regrouped and handed the Trojans a 25-17 defeat in the fourth set to win 3-1. UCSB was on point defensively in the fourth and held USC to a .000 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blocker Evan Licht continues playing at a high caliber level and had seven assists and four blocks to go along with a team-high 19 kills. The 19 kills makes it the sixth straight game he has recorded double-digit kills and the eighth time out of the last 10 games he has led the team.</p>\n<p>“He brings a level headedness to the court that really helps everyone. We kind of feed off his calmness at times,” freshman setter Jonah Seif said. “He doesn’t get dazed when he starts making errors; he stays focused and it really helps the team.”</p>\n<p>With an impressive .800 hitting percentage, Staahl delivered a clutch performance for the Gauchos and provided defense down the middle of the court with eight total blocks.</p>\n<p>“Staahl jumps a lot higher than [USC’s] middles do, so I just really tried to put the ball as high as I could for him,” Seif said. “He just hit over them, he had a really good night.”</p>\n<p>With only one game left in the regular season against No. 6 Pepperdine, the game has high implications for the Gauchos as they are still in contention of improving their seeding by as many as two slots. Currently, UCSB is half a game behind Stanford for the sixth seed and one game behind Pepperdine for fifth.</p>\n<p>“If we can come out and beat Pepperdine Friday that’ll mean a lot to our team because Pepperdine is a great team,” Staahl said.</p>\n<p>In the previous meeting between the two teams, UCSB was in the midst of a three game losing streak and lost to the Waves in three sets. In that game, Santa Barbara was unable to stop the impressive offense Pepperdine displayed.</p>\n<p>The Waves controlled every facet of the game and hit for a .420 clip and outdug UCSB by a 22-14 margin.</p>\n<p>UCSB will honor its three seniors before its final home game of the regular season, including team captain Davis and Evans.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against Pepperdine is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 11th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/","id":5316,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5315,5314,5313],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ready to Snap Two-Game Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_0072.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_0072.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With only two games left in the regular season, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team plans to end the season strong and gain momentum for the playoffs when it plays USC tonight at the Thunderdome.

Although the team has lost consecutive games for the first time since February after Friday’s five-set loss to BYU, the Gauchos have still won seven of their last nine matches, including sweeping five of those opponents in three sets.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest thing is we’re not killing ourselves as much, we’re making teams play,” Licht said. “[Head Coach Rick McLaughlin] is giving us great scouting reports. When we get the ball we serve hard, we pass well, good things happened and it’s showed over the past few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, USC comes into the Thunderdome at 6-16 overall and in MPSF play, and are eliminated from postseason contention. In the last meeting between these two teams in Los Angeles, the Gauchos upset the Trojans 3-1, which marked the turning point in the season for the Gauchos as the team went on to win eight of the following nine games.</p>\n<p>“[USC is] going to be a lot better this time. They’re going to be hungry,” McLaughlin said. “Last time we were the ones who surprised them. They’re going to try to surprise us so we just got to be ready and play like the way we did [against BYU], and if we do that we’ll have a good chance.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera will be the main threat likely to cause problems for Santa Barbara. In his last game against Cal State Northridge, Rivera had a team-high 18 kills and hit for an impressive .500 clip. This season, Rivera is third on the team with 147 kills so far.</p>\n<p>UCSB will still be without some of its key players tonight including senior outside hitter Miles Evans, whose presence was missed in Friday’s game versus BYU. Still, the Gauchos understand the importance of finishing the season strong as they prepare to play in the MPSF playoffs in two weeks.</p>\n<p>“We have to finish strong heading into the playoffs, we don’t want to go not playing our best,” McLaughlin said. “If we can play like we did [against BYU] I think we got a good shot at these next two opponents … That’s easier said than done.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50748\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50748\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/","id":5337,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5336,5335,5334],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to No. 1 BYU in Full Five Sets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_009.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_009.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  In February, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team lost against top-ranked BYU in Utah in five sets.

The defeat comes as UCSB’s first home loss since January and only its second loss in its past nine games. BYU extended its winning streak to 12 and improves to 20-3 overall and 19-2 in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>“Any time you can go toe-to-toe with the No. 1 team in the country, some good stuff’s happening on your side of the net,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “It’s a tough loss, but they learned a lot and we look forward to playing these guys again.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took the first set 25-20 in large part to various runs it made throughout the frame. However, the Cougars responded in game two despite trailing by as many as five points in the set, mounting a comeback to win 25-20.</p>\n<p>Each team traded sets from there on, with the Gauchos winning the third set 25-18 and losing the fourth set 25-21.</p>\n<p>In the fifth set, UCSB found itself down 8-5 before switching sides of the court and going on a 7-2 run to take a 12-10 lead. Yet, BYU remained poised and won 15-13. It was UCSB’s fifth five-set loss of the season.</p>\n<p>“Typically fifth sets are a little more steady than that, but both teams gave up some runs,” McLaughlin said. “We got ourselves right back in it and we actually had the lead and probably the player of the year, [BYU outside hitter] Taylor Sander, made it when it counted. That guy came through. He was clutch; it all goes to him.”</p>\n<p>Freshman setter Jonah Seif was able to read the Cougar defense throughout the course of the match, setting up many opportunities for UCSB and recording 45 assists in the match. Santa Barbara was led by Licht, who had a career-high 21 kills to go along with four blocks and eight digs, making it the seventh time out of the past nine games he has led the Gauchos in kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos had 16 blocks and limited Brigham Young to just a .187 hitting percentage, Sander delivered a clutch performance and took over late in the game on his way to recording 18 kills and 11 digs. Freshman opposite Ben Patch was equally impressive with 19 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB now gets ready to play against USC on Wednesday in its second-to-last game of the regular season at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/","id":5336,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5335,5334,5333],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Streak Ends at Seven","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MVBall-Mark-Brocher-DSC_5654.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MVBall-Mark-Brocher-DSC_5654.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"All good things must come to an end, and that was the case for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team last night against No. 6 Cal Baptist.

From there on, the Lancers dominated the frame, scoring eight of the final nine points to steal the set.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist picked up where it left off from the first set and had an early advantage in the second game.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos mounted a comeback of their own and tied the frame at 18, despite trailing throughout. Just as in the previous set, Cal Baptist outlasted UCSB for a 26-24 win.</p>\n<p>The Lancer’s two Brazilian outside hitters, senior Levi Cabral and sophomore Guilherme Koepp combined for 24 kills as Cal Baptist won the third set 25-19 for the sweep.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist was extremely efficient on offense in its last two sets, hitting for an impressive .640 clip in the second set with 17 kills, followed by a .409 hitting percentage in the final set. The Gauchos did not help themselves either, committing 16 total errors in the game compared to just eight errors for the Lancers.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht had another big game for UCSB. Licht led all Gauchos in kills with 13, making it the sixth time in eight games he has lead the team in kills. Senior middle blocker Dylan Davis had a subpar night for his standards, hitting only .091 with five kills and two blocks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have no time to dwell on the loss of the winning streak as it must prepare to face the top-ranked team in the nation on Friday in BYU.</p>\n<p>The Cougars enter as the only team as hot as the Gauchos before their loss against Cal Baptist. Brigham Young is currently on an 11-game winning streak and serves as a measuring stick for the Gauchos as the playoffs approach.</p>\n<p>“We know we can beat any team in our league, we proved it throughout our season,” Evans said. “We’re just going to have to take it to the teams.”</p>\n<p>In the previous match between the two teams, the Gauchos took the Cougars to the brink of defeat but were outlasted by BYU in the fifth set.</p>\n<p>In that game, four different Gauchos had double digit kills including senior outside hitter Miles Evans who had a career-high 21 kills. However, BYU’s junior outside hitter Taylor Sander had 20 kills, four digs and three blocks, which proved to be the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of confidence coming into the next match,” Evans said. “We know we can beat them and we really want to [win] so we can have a good chance for a good seed.”</p>\n<p>Besides serving as a measuring stick, Friday’s game against BYU will be critical in terms of seeding. The Gauchos are still in the hunt for the fourth seed in the playoffs which will grant them home court advantage. Santa Barbara has a 10-4 record at home but has struggled on the road, defeating only three conference opponents away from home and making the remaining games that more important.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are starting to feel the late season grind with only three games left in the regular season. UCSB was dealt with a devastating blow during last week’s trip to Hawaii. Evans suffered a high ankle sprain while playing against Hawaii when he stepped on sophomore middle blocker Jake Staahl’s foot.</p>\n<p>Ruled out by doctor’s for four to six weeks, the injury came as a surprise to Evans who might have played his last game as Gaucho. Evans will attempt to come back in three weeks, which will be put him on track to play in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against BYU is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 4th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/","id":5335,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5334,5333,5332],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Red Hot Gauchos Travel to Cal Baptist","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  Having already clinched a spot in the postseason, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team looks to build on its current seven-game winning streak tonight against No. 6 Cal Baptist.

UCSB has had difficulty on the road and entered last weekend’s series with a 2-8 mark away from home, but has now won four of its last five road games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal Baptist enters with an identical record to the Gauchos after defeating Pepperdine in its last conference game. However, the game will be nothing more than a friendly scrimmage for the Lancers, who are ineligible for the postseason this year.</p>\n<p>In the previous meeting between these two teams back in early February, the back-and-forth contest went the full five sets, with the Gauchos prevailing in a thrilling final game after being down earlier in the frame. It has been UCSB’s only five-set win this year.</p>\n<p>Three Gauchos had double-digit kills in that game including senior middle blocker Dylan Davis and sophomore opposite Matt Marsh, who both had a team-high 13 kills. Davis finished with an incredibly efficient .571 hitting percentage. Sophomore outside hitter Kevin Donohue also provided energy off the bench and contributed seven kills in the match.</p>\n<p>Despite winning the game, the Gauchos still had trouble defending the Lancer’s two Brazilians on the left side of the court. Sophomore outside hitter Guilherme Koepp had 21 kills in the game and hit for a .455 clip, second-best on the team. UCSB was more adept at containing the Lancers’ other Brazilian outside hitter, senior Levi Cabral, who had 16 kills but hit only .171.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara still has to account for Cabral on the service line, as he ranks third in the conference in service aces per set with 0.41, and his 4.14 kill average is fourth in the league overall.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB will rely on team captain Davis to provide offense and defense for the team. This season, Davis is second on the team in kills with 186, second in hitting percentage with a .467 clip and has totaled 133 blocks, the most of any Gaucho on the team.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/","id":5334,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5333,5332,5331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Seventh Straight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Besides getting to spend spring break in Honolulu, the No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team also got to benefit from taking two games from the University of Hawaii this weekend, winning 3-1 on Frida...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Besides getting to spend spring break in Honolulu, the No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team also got to benefit from taking two games from the University of Hawaii this weekend, winning 3-1 on Friday and 3-0 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>After beginning the season 5-11, the Gauchos have been on a tear since, winning seven straight games and nine of their last 10.

Licht’s performance coupled with nine kills from sophomore outside hitter Austin Kingi was too much to overcome for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Licht has played a crucial part in the winning streak. In the seven games, he has led the Gauchos in kills in five of them and has totaled 87 during the span.</p>\n<p>Entering Friday’s game vying for a slot in the playoffs against a Hawaii team right on its tail, UCSB knew it had to come out with at least one victory but had the disadvantage of holding a 4-8 record on the road.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos never let the Warriors establish a rhythm on offense and disrupted the flow, despite allowing a .355 hitting percentage to Hawaii in set one. UCSB was able to outlast its opponent when senior outside hitter Miles Evans delivered the final kill for a 25-23 win to steal the first frame.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara displayed just how potent it can be on offense in the second set, hitting for a .440 clip en route to taking the set 25-21. Freshman setter Jonah Seif distributed the ball on-point in his first two sets and finished with 13 assists in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB seemed to be on the verge of completing its third consecutive sweep but Hawaii prevailed with excellent defense in third set and won 25-18. The comeback attempt fell short as the Gauchos closed out the match 25-22 in the fourth game to win 3-1</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to overcome a 10-6.5 difference in blocks thanks to the efficiency of Licht, Evans and senior middle blocker Dylan Davis.

Entering in ninth-place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with nine conference games left on the season, the Gauchos will have to come out victorious in a pair of must-win-games against No. 4 Stanford and No. 15 Pacific this weekend to keep its playoff hopes alive.</p>\n<p>“Every game is definitely a must-win from now on,” junior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “If we can get two wins per week it would be extra huge. We need to make sure we take care of business when the time comes.”</p>\n<p>After a dreadful road trip in which the Gauchos went 2-5, UCSB will finally play a home game for the first time in over a month when it faces Stanford Friday. At 7-12 record overall and 5-10 in conference, the Gauchos will this time have the advantage of playing at home where they are 5-4.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I feel like we’re going to be more comfortable, more confident, and just a little more relaxed out there at home,” Evans said. “They’re coming to our gym and they’re going to have to play their best to beat us.”</p>\n<p>However, Stanford (12-6 overall, 9-6 MPSF) stands in the way of UCSB’s postseason chances. In its previous meeting, the Cardinal swept the Gauchos with a big performance coming from junior outside hitter Brian Cook, who recorded 11 kills, six digs and four blocks. Junior outside hitter Steven Irvin is second on the team in kills (224) and will also be a threat on the left side.</p>\n<p>“They have the option of Brian Cook; he’s definitely a player they like to go to,” junior libero Chad Kingi said. “If we shut him and [Irvin] down, I think we’ll have a very good chance.”</p>\n<p>Pacific will present another threat to Santa Barbara Saturday. At 5-9 overall and 3-9 in league, the Tigers present a more favorable matchup for the Gauchos. However, Pacific defeated UCSB in five sets back in January, which at the time, extended UCSB’s season-long losing streak to six games.</p>\n<p>Although not as potent offensively, proven by their second to last place rank in kills and assists per set in the league, the Tigers’ bread and butter this season has been their defense, which ranks near the top of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I think in the past we really let other teams dictate what happens,” Kingi said. “We now realize we have to put pressure on other teams and make them actually beat us, and I think if we actually do that we will be in playoff contention.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will rely on senior middle blocker Dylan Davis who leads the team in blocks (95) and is second in kills (131).</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match versus Stanford is scheduled for 7 p.m. and Saturday’s game against Pacific will begin at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1659553196\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50579\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50572\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/local-organization-opposes-beach-revamp-asks-county-to-reevalute/mvolleyball-mark-brocherdsc_6265/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1360097226\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MVolleyball Mark BrocherDSC_6265\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50572\" alt=\"MVolleyball Mark BrocherDSC_6265\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>MARK BROCHER / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>UCSB needs wins against both Stanford and Pacific to keep its playoff hopes alive.</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Currently 7-11 overall and 5-9 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, Santa Barbara is fully aware of the importance of this game as it sits in 10th place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Long Beach enters with a 12-4 record overall and 10-3 in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>In its last game against UCLA on Wednesday, UCSB handily took care of business versus the Bruins, winning 3-1. The third time was the charm on this occasion for the Gauchos as it was their first win against UCLA this year, after two previous meetings between the two teams resulted in losses.</p>\n<p>“[Beating UCLA] was one of the best feelings I’ve ever had,” Evans said. “It was surreal because we really thought we could take it to them. We had a great feeling before playing this match and we really stuck it on them.”</p>\n<p>A major factor to UCSB’s win was its passing game. The team limited its errors and was on point on the offensive side of the ball. Defensively, junior libero Chad Kingi delivered key saves throughout the four sets and ended with a team-high 11 digs for the night.</p>\n<p>“We were aggressive on the service line and we knew we needed to pass well because [UCLA] has great servers,” Evans said. “We got a couple good digs in the moment and we shut down their good players. We employed our defensive strategies very well and it worked out.”</p>\n<p>In their first conference game this year back in early January, the 49ers lost in straight sets to the Gauchos. With each team changing drastically since its first encounter, Santa Barbara understands it will not be able to rely on the same game plan it did earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“Both teams, us and them, have changed a lot since the beginning of the season,” Evans said. “I think we’re going to try a couple of the same things, but we’re also going to employ a new strategy based on what they’ve improved on and who their best players are.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match against the 49ers is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/","id":5331,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5330,5329,5328],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to No. 7 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Coming in with a road victory under its belt for the first time this season, the UCSB men’s volleyball team looks to keep its momentum going tonight when it travels to No. 7 UCLA.

Santa Barbara won its first road game of the season last week against USC to snap a four-game skid, and despite still being 1-7 on the road, the Gauchos are fully prepared to enter the John Wooden Center now that each game bares postseason implications.</p>\n<p>“It’s always fun to go to another team’s house and take it to them, and show we’re not where we should be in the standings,” senior middle blocker Dylan Davis said. “We can handle any team we play against.”</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB not being short of confidence, the Bruins enter with plenty of momentum themselves after sweeping two conference opponents in dominating fashion last week. With a record of 11-8 overall and 7-6 in the MPSF, the Bruins handed Pepperdine its first home loss of the season after compiling a season-high .522 hitting percentage to defeat USC as well.</p>\n<p>In the first game between these two teams, the Bruins capitalized on key substitutions made after the second set to overcome a 0-2 deficit and steal a tough five-set match away from the Gauchos. UCLA again came out victorious in its second meeting of the season, defeating Santa Barbara handily in four sets back in January.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB has risen to the occasion when up against high caliber teams in the MPSF this year, taking many of its opponents down to the wire.</p>\n<p>“We know that we can beat any team in our league because we’ve been playing with the top teams really close,” Evans said. “We’re really stoked because we want to show we can beat them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to be alert when the Bruins serve as UCLA is first in the league in service aces per set with 1.52. More importantly, the Gauchos will have to keep focus as the game progresses and limit their errors in crucial situations.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/","id":5330,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5329,5328,5327],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":21,"route":"/categories/sports/volleyball","highestPage":32}},"__N_SSG":true}
