After losing to the Bruins in five sets in the first meeting, the Gauchos will finally have a shot at redeeming themselves in a game they have had circled on their calendar since the last time the two teams played.</p>\n<p>“The first match we played them was our very first game of the year and it was a close loss; we lost to them in five sets [after] being up 2-0 in that match,” sophomore outside hitter Kevin Donohue said. “Ever since that match has ended, we’ve had our sights for the game on Friday; we know we’re definitely a team capable of beating UCLA.”</p>\n<p>Last week’s defeat against Cal State Northridge ended the Gauchos’ three-game win streak and dropped them to 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the MPSF season, with each of the losses going the full five sets. UCLA enters the match at 5-3 overall and is tied with UCSB and five other teams for fourth place in the conference after losing to UC Irvine on Tuesday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In its first encounter of the season, UCSB was unable to counter key substitutions made by the Bruins after taking a 2-0 lead in the game, a move that caught Santa Barbara off guard and ended up being the deciding factor in the match. UCLA came back from the deficit and outlasted the Gauchos in the final set to earn the victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will come more prepared defensively to face the Bruins this time around in a critical conference matchup with potential postseason implications down the line for both teams. Offensively, UCSB will rely on the duo of sophomore outside hitter Austin Kingi, who leads the team in kills with 53 on the season, and sophomore Matt Marsh, who is second with 50 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also look to its passing game to facilitate scoring opportunities to its hitters and throw off the UCLA defense.</p>\n<p>“We know from the service line we’re a great team and we can pass the ball well and get all our hitters going offensively; that’s going to be our biggest key against UCLA,” Donohue said. “The last four, six days, our biggest focus has been the serving pass and playing together, playing with fire and emotion, and getting ourselves mentally prepared to play UCLA.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Rob Gym.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 18th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/","id":5355,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5354,5353,5352],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kathy Gregory Announces Retirement","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Monday, it was announced that the only head coach the UCSB women’s volleyball program has ever known would retire.

On Tuesday afternoon, Head Coach Kathy Gregory officially announced in a press conference full of supportive and adoring players, coaches, alumni and faculty that after 38 years, she was moving on.</p>\n<p>“I really did not think I would be coaching for 38 years,” Gregory said. “I look at myself and say how blessed and lucky I am to be able to do something that doesn’t kill you, doesn’t make you hate it or want to walk away. I am the lucky one. Everyone sitting here today realize that I have something special.”</p>\n<p>Gregory leaves behind a large and lasting legacy. She compiled 882 wins, the fifth most in NCAA Division I history. Under her guidance, the Gauchos went on to 27 NCAA Tournaments and, along with only three other schools, advanced to the first 26. Gregory also took her team to the NCAA Elite Eight three times and to the Sweet Sixteen two more times. She was honored as the AVCA National Coach of the Year in 1993, was a four-time AVCA West Region Coach of the Year and a seven-time Big West Conference Coach of the Year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To Gregory, what was even more important than winning was the success and growth of her players.</p>\n<p>“The most important part of this job that I want people to realize is the students and the fact that you have to impact their lives,” Gregory said. “I am not the easiest coach, I’ll be the first to say it, but life is not easy. Life is very demanding. The challenges that all of us have faced and are going to face is what real competitors are about.”</p>\n<p>Current and past players spoke about the honor it was to play under the direction of Gregory and what it meant to be a student of her game.</p>\n<p>“It means the world to me to be a part of this with Kathy, because she has done everything for me and I will owe her everything the rest of my life and try and repay her with what she has taught me throughout the four years I played at Santa Barbara,” former player Dana Vargas said. “I would not be the young woman that I am today without Kathy. Kathy always shows you the big picture and things to concentrate on, and I am so thankful.”</p>\n<p>Speaking on behalf of the current women’s volleyball team was junior middle blocker Jenna Wilson.</p>\n<p>“I can say you’re the toughest coach I have ever had by far, and anyone who has played for her knows that,” Wilson said. “But I am so grateful. I wouldn’t have it any other way because you have taught us so much about life, not just volleyball, and helped us to grow so much. At the same time, there was never a dull moment with you.”</p>\n<p>Gregory’s infamous energy could not be calmed even on her final day. Throughout the conference she had been lively and enjoyed her time. It had been quite clear this was not a sad moment, but as she came to the end of her address, she let all in attendance know exactly how exciting it was to be around her, much to the amusement to the audience.</p>\n<p>“Everyone asks you ‘How do you want to be remembered?’ Alright, I want to tell you how I want to be remembered. Number one, I want to be remembered for commitment and always giving 100 percent of myself to this job and this program for 38 years. Two, 100 percent graduation rate of any woman that played for me for four years. Three, I lived my life filled with gratitude and appreciation for all the opportunities that I have had in my life and I have tried to instill that attitude into my players. And four, I walked away with the same competitive fire and energy that I had when I started this in 1975.”</p>\n<p>Gregory may be stepping down as head coach, but she may be moving to other endeavors on campus.</p>\n<p>“It is not the end for Kathy. We are going to ask her to look at the possibility of us starting a beach volleyball program.” UCSB Athletics Director Mark Massari said. “The NCAA announced that as an emerging sport recently. I have held off on that a little bit. Kathy has wanted to push for that. I have held off to be sure we are in it to win it. I know we are now, so she is going to start that with us.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/","id":5354,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5353,5352,5351],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop First Away Game of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The first road game of the season did not go as planned for the No. 9 UCSB men’s volleyball team as it lost in five sets against No. 11 Cal State Northridge Friday night, snapping the team’s three...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The first road game of the season did not go as planned for the No. 9 UCSB men’s volleyball team as it lost in five sets against No. 11 Cal State Northridge Friday night, snapping the team’s three-game win streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were outlasted by the Matadors in the final set, dropping the team’s record to 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the MPSF.

After the stoppage in play, the Gauchos went on a 5-2 run.

UCSB took the first set of the match thanks in large part to sophomore opposite Matt Marsh’s efficient offense, who totaled eight kills with a hitting percentage of .636 in the first set.</p>\n<p>Defense was also a key component for the Gauchos as they limited Loyola to just a .084 hitting percentage over the course of the game and compiled 12.5 blocks, compared to just 5.5 for the Ramblers.</p>\n<p>“Defense was a huge factor in that game,” senior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “We knew what to expect from that team; we were able to recognize what they were going to do almost before they did it so it was easier to play defense. It was easier to block against them.”</p>\n<p>The win over Loyola came a day after the Gauchos split their opening games of the tournament, sweeping Lewis in three sets and losing a close five-set contest to the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Davis was big in the second game versus the Flyers as he had seven kills in the match with six block assists. UCSB ended the first set 25-15 and Davis had three straight aces in the second set to give the Gauchos a 2-0 advantage. With the score at 22-19, UCSB held off the Flyers and closed out the final set with three straight points to win 25-19.</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, the Gauchos seemed ready to sweep UCLA after taking the first two sets. In a back-and-forth first set, Evans gave the Gauchos the set with his fourth kill of the game to win 27-25. UCSB won the second set 25-21 with another clinching kill for Evans, who had 11 on the day.</p>\n<p>After a substitution by the Bruins before the third set, UCLA was able to mount a comeback, evening the match at two sets apiece after winning the third set 25-22 and dominating the fourth 25-14. Holding on to a 14-13 advantage in the final set, junior outside hitter Robart Page sealed the victory for the Bruins with his 22nd kill of the match to lead all players.</p>\n<p>“[UCLA] made a couple substitutions going into that third game; I don’t think we were really prepared for it,” Davis said. “From that point on we just really let things get away from us; the momentum just really switched.”</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for the start of conference play as it hosts Long Beach State Wednesday night at 7:00 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-place-ucsb-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-place-ucsb-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-place-ucsb-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-place-ucsb-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-place-ucsb-invitational/","id":5351,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5350,5349,5348],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Gauchos Earn 2012 All-Big West Honors","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite a season in which the UCSB women’s volleyball team finished 16-17 and 9-9 in the Big West conference, three players received great praise for their play this season.

She finished her freshman campaign by shattering the UCSB and Big West digs record of 652 by recording 792 digs. Formico led the conference with 5.87 digs per set, which also ranked her eighth in the nation. She was not just a force on the court defensively, as she was also the Gauchos’ second leading server with 29 service aces on the year.</p>\n<p>“It’s quite an honor because the Big West coaches are really smart coaches. They know what kind of impact a player makes,” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “For her to get Freshman of the Year shows the magnitude of what she did for us.”</p>\n<p>At the outside hitter position, Leah Sully was named as a first team All- Conference player. As the Gauchos’ top scorer, Sully led UCSB with 1,798 total swings and 558 kills, which gave her the highest total in the Big West, and her 4.13 kills per set ranked her third in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Leah was well deserving because if you look at her she was third in hitting, but I think the biggest thing is she’s an all-around player,” Gregory said. “She plays every play; she doesn’t get to take a play off and she elevated her game at the end of the season, which is what I’m most impressed with, that she played even better at the end.”</p>\n<p>Sully led the Gauchos with 33 service aces this season and showed her ability on both offense and defense as she accumulated 495 digs, second on the team behind Formico and ninth in the conference with 3.67 per set.</p>\n<p>“Obviously it’s a huge honor; it is really cool to get this because I was honorable mention last year,” Sully said. “It is always great to improve and be recognized for it. I’ve always wanted to be an All-American so I’ll keep pushing myself and hopefully get that next year.”</p>\n<p>Thompson was named as an honorable mention to the All-Conference team this season as she was the Gauchos’ second leading scorer. Thompson was second on the team with 311 kills and a .224 hitting percentage. She ranked third on the team with 28 service aces, behind only Sully and Formico. Defensively, Thompson was one of the top blockers for Santa Barbara, recording 123 total blocks on the year and 1.06 blocks per set, both good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>“I feel very honored to receive the award, thanks to the help of my other teammates who helped me get this, like Leah and Taylor, who essentially set the bar,” Thompson said. “Hopefully I can build on this and achieve greater next season.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/","id":5375,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5374,5373,5372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Two on Road to Snap Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team needed every possible set to win its two games this weekend against UC Riverside Friday and Cal State Fullerton Saturday, with both games going the full five sets.

On Saturday evening, UCSB dominated the first set, hitting .333 and committing just one error. Fullerton hit negative .022 in the first set and lost 25-13.</p>\n<p>“After the first game we had to make sure we didn’t let up. I think during the first game we were all having fun and we didn’t put pressure on ourselves,” freshman libero Taylor Formico said. “We were just playing our game and not making mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara then took a 2-0 lead after winning the second set 25-21, but could not finish off the Titans that easily. Fullerton battled back to win sets three and four 25-18 and 25-20, respectively. In the final set, Santa Barbara jumped to an early 3-2 lead and never let up. Freshman middle blocker Britton Taylor recorded the game-winning kill to seal the victory 15-12.</p>\n<p>Taylor hit .455 on the night and was one of three Gauchos with double-digit kills. Junior outside hitter Leah Sully led the team with 20 kills. The Titans’ senior outside hitter Kayla Neto recorded a match-high 23 kills on the night in her final home game at Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>On Friday night in Riverside, UCSB came out on top, ending its four-game losing streak. Riverside fell to 7-22 on the year and 1-14 in the Big West. Santa Barbara won the first set in a closely contested 25-23 game. The Highlanders, however, took the following two sets to lead on the night two games to one.</p>\n<p>“After we were down, we came together as a team between every point, which is really important,” Formico said. “Our mistakes really beat us in the first two games, so we just had to limit our errors. Once we did that, we played a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Riverside was unable to capitalize on the lead, opening the door for UCSB to fight back. In the fourth set, with the score tied 18-18, Sully put the ball away, giving Santa Barbara a 19-18 lead. The Gauchos won the fourth set with a kill by junior opposite Katey Thompson to force the fifth set.</p>\n<p>In the deciding set of the night, Riverside jumped out to an early 4-0 lead. Defiant, UCSB scored six of the next eight points to tie the game at six apiece. The two teams exchanged points until the Gauchos went on a run to take a 13-9 lead and capped it with a kill by Sully to win 15-11.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home for its final two games of the season against Long Beach on Friday and UC Irvine on Saturday.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 19th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49003\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/ucsb-wins-road-snap-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49003\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/ucsb-wins-road-snap-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/ucsb-wins-road-snap-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/ucsb-wins-road-snap-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/ucsb-wins-road-snap-skid/","id":5372,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5371,5370,5369],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for Final Road Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team enters this weekend having lost its last four games.

Junior outside hitters Leah Sully and Katey Thompson led the Gauchos with 15 kills each while freshman middle blocker Britton Taylor recorded 12 kills of her own.</p>\n<p>“[Riverside] never quits and they play every team hard. We are going to try and make them pass badly so that they are out of system,” freshman libero Taylor Formico said. “We’re going to try to shut down their outside Ashley Cox, who has been doing really well. We think if we serve tough and pass well, our offense will come along and we‘ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Riverside was led by senior outside hitter Amanda Vialpando, who scored 20 kills along with 20 digs on the night. Freshman outside hitter Ashley Cox put up 16 kills as well as 25 digs, tops for the Highlanders on the night.</p>\n<p>Cox and Vialpando rank at No. 7 and 8 on the Big West kills leader board and will be key players for UCSB to keep its eyes on.</p>\n<p>“We know not to take [Riverside] lightly,” Formico said. “Although their record isn’t very good they did just beat Irvine and have been doing well.”</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s match against Cal State Fullerton, UCSB will have to overcome a team that will be playing with plenty of emotion and wanting to send its seniors out with a victory on senior night.

UCSB won the first set only to drop the next two. Then, in sets four and five, Santa Barbara squeezed out close 25-23 and 15-12 wins to earn the ‘W.’</p>\n<p>“Basically they know us and we know them,” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “It is the same offense and same defense. It’s just going to be a matter of who can execute under pressure.”</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Leah Sully had a huge game against Pacific, recording 22 kills and 19 digs. However, after recent struggles against Hawaii and Cal State Northridge, the Gauchos will return to their more experienced line-up that centers around Sully.</p>\n<p>“We will start playing a 5-1 with Kara [Sherrard] and Ali Santi setting first,” Gregory said. “We will start with that because [their] leadership is better. We have had good practices. We worked on our offense and serving so I think we will be ready to play.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos will see another team they’ve already played once this season: UC Davis. The Aggies are currently 13-13 overall and 7-6 in the Big West. Holding the spot just above the Gauchos in the standings, Davis will look to create some space in rankings.</p>\n<p>The Aggies took the loss in four sets in the last meeting between these two teams on Oct. 12. In that match, three Gauchos recorded double digit kills.

The Gauchos will finish their game with Hawaii late Thursday night and head back to the mainland for the second game of their road trip.</p>\n<p>Cal State Northridge currently ranks third in the Big West standings with a 7-5 conference and 16-8 overall record. The Matadors last defeated Long Beach State in five sets Saturday night in a game where three players recorded double digit kills. Sophomore middle blocker Casey Hinger led the Northridge attack with 17 kills, tying her season high. Hinger is second in the Big West averaging 1.23 blocks per set. Junior setter Sydney Gedryn, who is seventh at a 1.13 blocks per set, helps lead the Matadors as the top blocking team in the conference.</p>\n<p>The second place Gauchos will need a big win to maintain their position this weekend. At 13-12 and 6-4 in the Big West, UCSB needs another strong outing against the Matadors. The last time these two teams met, Santa Barbara swept CSUN in three sets. Junior outside hitter Leah Sully led the attack with 16 kills to go along with her 13 digs. Freshman middle blocker Britton Taylor recorded 10 kills and hit .400 on the night to lead the Gauchos to a .254 team hitting percentage. UCSB also held Northridge to a .182 hitting percentage, a strength of the Gauchos as they rank third in the Big West with a .179 opponent hitting percentage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since the meeting on Oct. 5, Santa Barbara has gone 4-2 and has become a much-improved offensive team.

Last month, UCSB went 5-3 and is still in the midst of a modest two-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>The offense has started to really come together in recent weeks as the Gauchos are now scoring from all across the court. In their most recent victory, four players recorded double-digit kills, and also hit over .230 as a team and recorded nine service aces the last two games.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, however, enters the match as the hottest team in perhaps all of volleyball. The Rainbow Wahine have won twelve straight games, dating all the way back to a Sept. 9 loss against UCLA. Hawaii junior outside hitter Emily Hartong is also coming off arguably the best week of her career.</p>\n<p>Hartong earned her third Big West Player of the Week honor for her performances against Long Beach State and UC Irvine. She was also named Sports Imports/AVCA Division I Player of the Week. She recorded a career-high 33 kills and 15 digs last Friday and 29 kills and a career-high 16 digs on Saturday. In the last meeting between these two teams on Oct. 6, Santa Barbara fell in three sets at home. The Gauchos managed just 13 points in the first set, but steadily got better through the night, scoring 16 and 21 in the second and third sets, respectively. The game boiled down to the blocking of Hawaii and the Gauchos’ mistakes that made the game so one-sided. “We will have to spread the court around,” Gregory said. “We will hope they don’t attack our right side blocking and our right side defense like they did last time because that was the problem.”</p>\n<p>Since that loss though, UCSB has gotten hot and it may be worth noting that as good as the Rainbow Wahine have been, their only two losses have come at home.</p>\n<p>Tonight, the game will take place at Hawaii’s Stan Sheriff Center at 10 p.m. Pacific time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/","id":5382,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5381,5380,5379],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Second in Conference With Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team celebrated the Halloween weekend in high spirits after defeating rival Cal Poly in four sets Saturday night.

Junior outside hitter Kara Sherrard led the Gauchos with seven kills in the first set, while junior opposite Katey Thompson came away with five and freshman middle blocker Britton Taylor had four.</p>\n<p>“The middles on Cal Poly are a little slower and we tried to take advantage of that,” Sully said. “We made a point in the locker room that we didn’t want to have to go to a fourth set, but they started playing better and capitalized on our weaknesses.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The second set was much of the same from the Gauchos, winning 25-20.

McConnell had 23 kills, 26 digs, 14 blocks and had a .346 hitting percentage over the weekend. Four different players racked up double digit kills for the Mustangs against Fullerton, showing their multi-faceted attack.</p>\n<p>“They have a lot of weapons because they are playing a 6-2 offense so they will always have three hitters,” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “For us to be successful, we are going to</p>\n<p>have to play good three hitter defense all night, we will need a good offensive night and were going to have to serve.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had the same opponents as Cal Poly last weekend and split the matches, dropping to Fullerton in five sets and defeating Riverside in four. The loss to Fullerton came on a night that junior opposite Katey Thompson had to sit with a knee injury, but she returned Saturday and seems to be healthy moving forward.</p>\n<p>This is the second meeting this year between the two teams. The first came on Sept. 29 when Santa Barbara took the win on the road in three sets. Thompson recorded 15 kills and three service aces, so her presence on the court will be quite a boost to the Gaucho offense. Cal Poly could not amount much of anything against the Santa Barbara defense last month. No Mustang recorded double-digit kills and as a team they hit just .123.</p>\n<p>“We can’t really look at what happened last time. Every time we play a match it’s a new game,” Thompson said. “You can’t rely on exactly what happened the last time, because since then, they have watched a lot of tape and have studied us much more.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play host where they are 4-4 this year. The Mustangs are 0-8 on the road this year and have no wins away from home, so before heading out to an Isla Vista style Halloween weekend, stop by the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. to see UC Santa Barbara take on rival Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/","id":5380,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5379,5378,5377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Breathe … Believe … Battle: Kerri Walsh Jennings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"At WinForver’s most recent event last week in Los Angeles, I had the opportunity to sit down with three-time Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings.

I knew it was possible. Making it happen is another thing, but Misty and I have had a winning recipe. We knew what it took to get there and every four years we would shake things up and we’d keep growing — and that’s how you keep being successful, is evolving and getting out of your comfort zone, and we really did that.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know some people doubted you and Misty going into London, but you only dropped one set. What obstacles did you have to overcome and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The public perception of us, for sure. I’ve never been an underdog my whole life and that didn’t sit well with me. That being said, in our heads we knew when we got there that we weren’t going to be the underdogs anymore. But we have other things too … life. I have two kids now. Our responsibilities are so much more now than they had in the past. And the game had grown so much in the two years we took off, so just getting reacquainted with each other after a couple years off and getting reacquainted with beach volleyball. There were a lot of really big challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You and Misty have been unstoppable. What’s it like playing with her?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s really fun. Her skills made me better and I always wanted to be better because she always carried her weight and I wanted to make sure that I did that. It was a true joy to play with her for so long. We had an amazing ride together — not always pretty, not always effortless … never effortless really, but it was really fun to go to work with her and grow up with her really.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Misty just retired. How much longer do you plan on playing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: My goal is to play in the 2016 Olympics and win a gold medal That’s my dream. I’m going to take a year off — I’m pregnant right now — have this beautiful baby and then I feel I have three years of really good volleyball in me. I just want to keep getting better and I feel I have so much more in me. So, once I find my partner in crime, we’ll go to work and we’ll hone our team and make sure we’re on task.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You and Misty will go down as the best duo in beach volleyball, but maybe also the best in all sports. Have you taken the time to reflect on everything you guys have done?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. I think that that’s something that will come maybe when I retire. I think that I’m just so in it right now and so present. I’m so grateful for what we had together and it’s so crazy to be talking in past tense about her. It was only two months ago that we did this together. I feel like we deserve to be in that conversation, and I hope that doesn’t sound arrogant. I just know that we had something special. Jerry Rice and Joe Montana, Pippen and Jordan — all these amazing duos — we absolutely deserve to be in that conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know you played indoor volleyball at Stanford. How did you get into beach volleyball?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Right when I finished college, after the Sydney Olympics, I needed a change. The options were to go to Europe and play or to try beach and Misty May-Treanor, one of the best players in the world, was looking for a partner. It was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up, so I did a gut check, an ego check. I went through a lot of growing pains in the first year, but I stuck with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know you have a cousin in Taylor Formico at UCSB. Have you kept up with how she’s doing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s been easy to keep up with her because she’s kicking butt apparently. I’m really proud of her. She’s a fighter and her dad is one of eight kids and he’s probably the most competitive of those eight and it’s really cool to see Taylor take so much after her father, and her mother and [to] see her excel where she’s worked so hard to get where she’s at.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s it like being a professional athlete and mom?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s a dream come true. I’ve always wanted to be a working mom like my mom. I’m passionate about both things. Obviously, my family is number one and to be able to combine it with something that I’m so passionate about in my career and the sport I love is truly a dream come true and I just want to keep the ride going as long as I can be the best me.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/","id":5378,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[5377,5376,5375],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":23,"route":"/categories/sports/volleyball","highestPage":32}},"__N_SSG":true}
