That game in particular displayed the growth of the young Gauchos side, with the team keeping the game close throughout despite junior Coco Miller–the team’s leading scorer–shooting only 2-17 from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s offense–the biggest culprit for the team’s slow start–has seen an uptick since sophomore guard Danae Miller came back from injury. Danae’s four assists per game leads the team, and her speed has allowed the Gauchos to play more in transition, leading to easier baskets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last game against CSUN, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson opted to tighten up the rotation, playing both Danae Miller and Coco Miller for almost the entire game. While the Gauchos scored 73 points in that game, the bench contributed only 11 of those points–with all 11 coming from junior forward Tal Sahar. As conference play continues and fatigue becomes more of a factor, Henrickson will need greater production from her bench if the Gauchos hope to stay competitive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one game into conference play, it’s risky to call any game a must-win matchup. Still, for two teams that have struggled mightily throughout the season, a win on Saturday will aid greatly in getting their season back on track. Given both teams’ offensive struggles and defensive prowess, expect a low-scoring affair on Saturday where 60 points may be all that’s needed to secure the win.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly (0-1, 3-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Poly women’s basketball team enters Saturday’s match just as desperate for a victory as any other Big West team after getting thumped at home by UC Irvine in their conference opener, 75-59.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the season, Cal Poly comes in with a 3-9 record, with only two of those victories over division I opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to the Gauchos, the Achilles heel for Cal Poly all season has been their offense, with the team scoring only about 60 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, however, the Mustang’s offense has been slightly more potent since the return of graduate transfer Hana Vesela from injury.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her three games this season, Vesela has averaged almost 11 points per game. As she gets more acclimated to the team’s offense, her offensive output should continue to increase even more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s game will be a battle of two nearly identical teams when it comes to play style. Both teams look to play inside out, featuring their big on the inside to swallow up rebounds and finish off easy layups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Mustangs, sophomore center Devin Stanback leads the team with 13.6 points per game while shooting an impressive 51 percent from the floor. For Santa Barbara, junior center Natalia Bruening has essentially played the same role, scoring 10 points per game while shooting 50 percent from the floor. Imperative to both team’s success on Saturday will be their stud center staying out of foul trouble–an issue that in particular has plagued Bruening throughout the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly also excels on the boards; despite their overall struggles, they have consistently out-rebounded their opponents throughout the season. For a Gauchos team that prefers to play with four guards, it will be imperative for them to box-out and limit any easy second chance opportunities for the Mustangs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State (0-0, 3-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being picked to finish fourth in the Big West preseason poll, Long Beach State struggled significantly in non-conference play. With both an anemic offense and an undersized core that has been dominated on the glass, LBS limps into conference play with a 3-10 record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Led by sophomore guard Shanaijah Davison’s 14.8 points per game, Long Beach State averages fewer than 60 points per game. Even Davison — a preseason All-Big West pick — has struggled with her efficacy, shooting only 37 percent from the floor despite taking almost 15 shots per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Long Beach has been able to keep it close — with five of the team’s losses scoring in the single digits — the team has been sunk by its 59 free throw percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Long Beach has played with a relatively solid defense — they currently hold opponents to 43 percent from the floor — their Achilles heel all season has been their lack of rebounds. On average, Long Beach State has been outrebounded by 16 rebounds per game, allowing their opponents to have second-chance opportunities despite their solid initial defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, they will enter conference play with a bit of momentum on their side after winning their last two non-conference matchups, including a 50-48 victory over Utah State in their last game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that game, graduate transfer forward Cydnee Kinslow made her season debut after sitting out the first 12 games injured, and immediately made her presence known by grabbing nine rebounds in 37 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The addition of Kinslow should help Long Beach play more competitively.    Though Long Beach State has struggled most of the season, don’t be surprised if Davison cleans up her offensive efficiency and leads the team to a .500 record in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UCI (1-0, 13-1)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Irvine women’s basketball team was selected to finish in third place by the Big West preseason poll with only sophomore forward Jordan Sanders earning a spot on the preseason All-Conference Team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, 13 games and one league match into the season, there is no doubt that the Anteaters are the team to beat thus far into conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UCI is at the top of the Big West conference with a 1-0 league record and, more importantly, an 11-2 overall mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the Anteaters two losses came against a very tough Oregon team ranked No. 5 in the country but the other came against a much weaker San Diego State team that is just 5-8 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDSU did beat two other Big West programs in Hawai’i and Cal State Fullerton but lost to UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UC Irvine is the only team in the league thus far to have double digit wins and that is in large part to the performance of Sanders who is averaging an astonishing 21.1 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is not just the best mark on her team but the second best average in the Big West sitting just behind UC Davis’ Morgan Bertsch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders also leads her team in rebounds per game with 5.5 boards per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also receives help from fellow teammates Lauren Saiki and Andee Ritter who both average double figures in points per contest.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With three stud players on offense, UC Irvine hopes it can continue its great start to the year and possibly earn a Big West title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine takes on CSUN on Saturday at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUN (1-0, 7-8)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team is currently 7-8 on the year and will look to get back to .500 as they played their second game of the conference schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been an up and down year for the Matadors but they were able to pick up a win in their most recent matchup against UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are led by senior center Channon Fluker who is averaging a double double on the year with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She also leads the team with the highest field goal percentage from the field with 48.3 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the problems that the squad has faced this year is that they lack a consistent second scorer behind Fluker. With no one on the team averaging double figures besides Fluker, it has been difficult at times for them to put up points consistently. With them in the midst of conference play, it will be crucial for a second scorer to emerge in order to keep opposing defenses from keying on Fluker in the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, CSUN has been very impressive on the defensive end of the floor as they have held opponents to just 38 percent from the field. Much of that can be attributed to the consistent ball pressure which has led to opposing offenses struggling to find the bottom of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Matadors to turn their season around, they will need to find more ways to score the basketball, which also means that they must improve their three point percentage. With more consistent from behind the three point line, it will help keep defenses honest which will lead to easier shots for every player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN is back in action at UC Irvine where they will look to pick up their second win in conference play at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hawai’i (0-1, 4-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Big West play in full effect, the Hawai’i women’s basketball team is set to bounce back following a tough league opener loss to Cal State Fullerton.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Hawai’i has struggled all year long boasting just a 4-10 overall mark to this point in the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Rainbow Wahine are just 1-4 away from their home court.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, they will return home for a quick two-game stretch with matches against UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just recently, Hawai’i had won three straight games with two coming against well known division I programs but it is now losers of three straight. It’s last two losses have been by a combined five points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were hoping to turn around this season and, despite a loss at the Cal State Fullerton, they still played a great game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Jan. 5, the Rainbow Wahine scored 68 points which was their third highest point total this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i’s big scorer in that game was redshirt sophomore forward Amy Atwell who came up huge. She scored a career high 25 points in just 16 minutes with 18 of those points coming in the second half alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the season, Atwell averages just four points a game, even after that terrific coming out party. With an increased role maybe she can be a factor this team needs to turn it around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Rainbow Wahine will hope to continue relying on junior forward Makenna Woodfolk who leads the team in points per game with the only player in double figures at 11.8.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, in the last three games she has averaged just three points per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i will host UC Davis on Saturday at 1 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUF (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal State Fullerton women come into Big West play in 2019 one year removed from finishing last in the conference, missing out on the Big West Tournament and losing 12 out of their final 13 games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, however, their season is moving in a totally different trajectory, as they are currently sporting a 9-5 record and have won seven of their last eight contests —  including a win over Hawaii in their conference opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans have a roster that contains a mixture of upperclassmen and underclassmen that provide valuable contributions to the squad. Four players are scoring in double figures on the season and that group is lead by redshirt senior Daeja Smith, whose averages of 13.8 points per game and 9.7 rebounds per game rank fifth and second in the Big West, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Smith, one of the keys to Fullerton’s early season success has been the playmaking ability of their backcourt duo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raina Perez and Jade Vega both average double-digit scoring numbers to go along with their averages of five-plus assists per game, each.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez and Vega rank second and third in the Big West in assists per game, giving Fullerton added versatility  as the two players are capable of handling the ball and playmaking for others on the floor. The ability that Perez and Vega have to score and assist the ball complements the inside scoring game of Daeja Smith and makes their team as a whole extremely difficult to guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans finished in last place a season ago and were yet again picked to finish last according to the Big West preseason poll, but with the improved play of their returning players and the addition of some elite newcomers, Fullerton will look to turn the tables on the conference and show everyone that they can be a legitimate force in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside (0-1, 6-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conference play for women’s basketball is now in full effect, as the second fixture for UC Riverside’s Big West campaign is set for this Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off a close 59-67 defeat to UC Davis, for their first Big West confrontation, the UC Riverside Highlanders will look to improve as the young conference schedule begins to ramp up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far through the season, the Highlanders find themselves at a 6-9 overall record; enough for a .400 win percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signs point upwards, however, as the team evenly split their game schedule in the month of December, snagging a couple of road wins along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although, they’ll want to find their rhythm as soon as possible considering they dropped their first conference matchup of the new year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside’s redshirt junior guard, Jannon Otto, leads all scorers on the team with 195 points to her name so far through the season; that’s a 13 point per game average. Playmaking seems to also run through her as she also leads her side in total assists with 47.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close behind Otto, in scoring, is junior forward Marina Ewodo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Featuring as the squad’s premier rim protector, Ewodo leads all her teammates in blocks, with 33, as well as rebounds, with a total of 107.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, these two tend to be at the top of opponents’ game plan as they play such a crucial part on the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of conference performance, UC Riverside finished as a middle of the table team in Big West standings last year; ending their campaign with a 6-10 overall record in conference play, good enough for the sixth seed in the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, they did perform very well during the postseason, making it as far as the semifinal stage; ultimately giving the No. 1 overall seed, UC Davis, a nail biter of a game after falling just short by a final score of 46-49.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as this young year goes, their 0-1 start places them in sixth place once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectations are high however, as a better league finish can set up yet another surprising playoff run for the Highlanders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up on UC Riverside’s schedule is another Big West bout, this time against Long Beach State, who is 3-10 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Long Beach State’s first Big West matchup, but the Highlanders should have a slight upper hand entering this one.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside hosts Long Beach State this Thursday, January 10th, in the SRC Arena at 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re the two-time defending regular season Big West champs. They’ve lost just four regular season Big West games in the last two years. They’ve got the fifth-leading scorer in the nation. They’ve won six games in a row.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis women’s basketball team is the team to beat in the Big West. That’s been the case for a couple of years, and a slow Aggie start isn’t enough to change that this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCD, now 9-5 and 1-0 in the Big West after beating UC Riverside, started this season 0-3. That mark included a blowout loss to then-no. 7 ranked Stanford and tough losses to Pacific and Portland State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That start seems to be in the past now for head coach Jennifer Gross’s squad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eighth-year coach has guided her team and steadied the ship, even despite some key graduations from last year’s group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the court, the turnaround has largely relied on the back of Morgan Bertsch, a 6’ 4” senior forward who’s fifth in the NCAA, is the leading scorer in UC Davis program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertsch goes, so does the Aggie’s offense. That hasn’t been a problem considering the senior’s production, but it gives opponents an obvious point to focus on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Point guard Kourtney Eaton has been the woman in charge of feeding Bertsch, a job the four-year starter and the program’s all-time assist leader has performed capably with 5.1 assists per game. Junior forward Nina Bessolo works as Bertsch’s scoring complement with 9.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game while sophomore Cierra Hall leads the team with 6.9 rebounds per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to the rest of the Big West, the Aggies love the three-ball. UCD has put up 333 threes so far this season, more than any other rival school. Only UCSB comes close with 331, and the Gauchos’ 26.1 percent mark from deep pales in comparison to UCD’s 32.4 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that shooting and all those points – the Aggies are second in the Big West in points per game at 71.4 – hasn’t come at the expense of their defense. UCD has given up just 62.5 points per game, again second in the conference, and are holding opponents to a Big West-worst 36.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis is rolling on both ends of the court right now as they begin to defend their crown again. It’s hard to bet against them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big West Prediction: UC Davis (Hard to bet against the champs when they’ve got the best scorer and maybe the best defense).</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Not to mention that the team will be fired up after their most recent record-breaking victory, as UCSB defeated Bethesda University by a score of 109-47; this 62-point margin was the largest in the school’s history.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the season, UCSB currently holds an 11-3 overall record. The Gauchos have also maintained a perfect record at home after being undefeated through seven games; they’ll look to extend and apply their home court dominance over Cal Poly as well.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ season hasn’t been nearly as favorable. The opposition holds a 4-9 overall record thus far; just above a .300 win percentage. They will be coming off a victory of their own, however, as they most recently defeated Holy Names University by a 68-47 final result. Prior to this, the Mustangs had experienced a four-game losing streak; one of which was an overtime heartbreaker at their own home.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have been the opposite of perfect when it comes to away games. Of the seven matches they’ve played on the road, Cal Poly has yet to win a single one of them.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, this will be the 114<sup>th</sup> time that these two teams have faced off against each other. In terms of all-time series, the Gauchos have the advantage as they lead the Mustangs by a record of 79-35. The last time that both these sides met was during the Big West Conference Tournament, where the quarterfinal confrontation was bested by UCSB with a final score of 75-53.</p>\n<p>After last week’s dominant performance, the Gauchos have now scored over 1,000 points on the season.</p>\n<p>A player to watch for the Gauchos is graduate guard Ar’mond Davis, who leads the team in total scoring with 199 points to his name. Freshman forward Amadou Sow also continues to shine as he leads the team in total rebounds with 90 on the season; he’s also second in blocks, with 10, and tied for fifth in steals, with 6.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Jay Nagle has also had a hot-hand lately. A key part in last game’s rout, Nagle finished with a game-leading 20 points. Just as important and only a score behind him was also freshman guard Sékou Touré, who protected the rim all night with 10 rebounds to go with his 18 points. Both players came off the bench in the last one, so it’ll be interesting to see what role the subs play in the upcoming conference matchup.</p>\n<p>Most of the Gauchos’ game-plan will have to be centered around the Mustangs’ leading scorer senior point guard Donovan Fields. The offense seems to run through his hands as Fields’ 206 total points and 56 total assists are both team-leading, and his team-leading 22 steals also shows his ability to step up on the other end as well.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Marcellus Garrick has also been on a tear for the Mustangs lately. Leading all scorers in their last game with 19 points, Garrick shot for 53% from field goal range, along with 50% from beyond the arc. A productive complement to Fields, it’ll be important for the Gauchos to not let either player get too open.</p>\n<p>Head coach Joe Pasternak has provided an injury update for Gaucho junior guard Max Heidegger, labeling his status as a “mild strain of his quad”. However, he was practicing Tuesday night, before the game, so his chances of league play look optimistic.</p>\n<p>With the conference play portion of the Big West set to begin, the all-games standings has UCSB sitting atop of the table at first place. Meanwhile, Cal Poly’s performance thus far places them in third-to-last place; this gulf in class is a clear indicator that this match should be in the Gauchos’ favor.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for this Wednesday, January 9<sup>th</sup>, in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. Come show your support for the Gauchos in this exciting Blue-Green Rivalry matchup!</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

UCSB men’s basketball team enters Big West Conference play on a hot streak </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— this year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with an 11-3 overall record and the top spot in the Big West with half of the season now in the books. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ offense has been quarterbacked by dynamic backcourt duo sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and sophomore captain point guard Devearl Ramsey. Ramsey has contributed 11.2 points per game while averaging 3.8 assists, which is sixth best in the conference — not to mention he shoots the fifth highest mark from deep in the Big West with a three-point percentage of 42 percent.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McLaughlin compliments 10.9 points per contest with 3.5 assists per game, giving him the eighth highest number of average assists in the Big West conference. Ramsey and McLaughlin, a pair of sophomores, control the ball on the attack for the offense, but it is graduate guard Ar’Mond Davis who delivers the bulk of the scoring for the Gauchos with 14.2 points per game. Davis adds 5.4 rebounds per game as a multifaceted offensive threat that crashes the boards, along with freshman forward Amadou Sow.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of Sow, the freshman won his first career Big West Men’s Basketball Player of the Week award after a 21-point, nine-rebound performance against mid-major No. 10 University of San Francisco. Sow is the most efficient shooter in the Big West Conference, shooting 58.2 percent on field goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been flashes of stardom from the other two freshmen on the team as guard Sékou Touré has the highest player efficiency rating in the Big West and as forward Jay Nagle owns the third best three-point percentage in the conference with 46.2 percent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a well-rounded team for the Gauchos this season, the real question is who will face the wrath of Head Coach Joe Pasternack in his second season with Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look at all of the teams in the fight for the Big West crown:</span></p>\n<p><b>UC Irvine, 12-4</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters held the top spot in the conference for the majority of the first half of the season before losing a couple toward the end of their non-conference schedule. Neck and neck with the Gauchos, Irvine has earned the mid-major No. 15 spot with a 12-4 record, placing the team second in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eaters opened the year up 7-0 with big wins against Texas A&amp;M and Santa Clara. They followed it up with another impressive victory of 80-75 over Saint Mary’s College in late November but finished off their non-conference season with a pair of losses a month later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, this Irvine team has a remarkable rotation with a dangerous and experienced duo of guards in the backcourt in, thanks to junior guards Evan Leonard and Max Hazzard who bolster Irvine’s deadly three-point attacks. Irvine’s 36.2 percent from deep is ideal when competing against the first-place Gauchos, who allow just 28.1 percent from the three, the 13th best in the NCAA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI’s graduate forward Jonathan Galloway sits in the No. 2 spot of the Big West in rebounding with 7.3 boards per game while senior forward Elston Jones supports with 7.1 rebounds per game, fifth in the conference. The pair of big men patrol the paint as well as any frontcourt in the Big West, allowing just 66.6 points against per contest which ranks slightly below UCSB’s top mark of 64.3 average points allowed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters, who surrender just 38 percent of field goals from opponents, thrive on the defensive end with the best defensive shooting percentage in the Big West. This makes the Eaters the most significant threat against UCSB which currently shoots a conference best of 48.1 percent from the field this year.</span></p>\n<p><b>University of Hawaii, 9-5</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winners of three games straight, the Rainbow Warriors have emerged as legitimate contenders to make a run for the title of Big West Champion as they currently sit in third place heading into the latter half of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawaii has a solid collective of starters that can score the ball well, as four players average double-figures in points led by junior guard Eddie Stansberry who posts 13.2 points per game following a 26-point performance against Alabama A&amp;M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stansberry delivers the most scoring on average, it is sophomore guard Drew Buggs who strikes with a pass-first mentality. Buggs owns the second highest assists per game in the Big West, averaging 5.0 per contest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buggs has an array of weapons at his disposal with Stansberry running the wing but when the Warriors look to move the ball inside, junior Zigmars Raimo is the likely recipient.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raimo, a Latvia native, rebounds at the fifth highest rate in the Big West with 7.1 boards per game while shooting 57 percent from the field, placing him as third in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawaii recorded statement wins against University of Colorado at Boulder and Utah earlier in the non-conference half of the season to build up its resume and makes an underdog run for the Big West title come conference play. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cal State Northridge, 6-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 6-24 season, one of the most disappointing years in program history, Cal State Northridge wiped the slate clean with the hire of first year Head Coach Mark Gottfried, in addition to adding former NBA Champion Mo Williams to the assistant coaching staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new-look leadership is certainly a huge reason why the Matadors rank among the best offenses in the Big West, but without freshman phenom Lamine Diane, CSUN could be in the same position as the season prior.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane has catapulted CSUN into fourth place in the conference through his Big West best of 24.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. The freshman also ranks among the top defenders with 1.7 steals per game while blocking 2.3 shots on average, both coming in first in the Big West as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the CSUN attack doesn’t just rely on Diane’s two-way ability. While the freshman tops out the Big West as the No. 1 scorer, it is sophomore guard Terrell Gomez who delivers 18.4 points on average for the third best mark among Big West players. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complementing Gomez in the backcourt, freshman guard Darius Brown II produces a play-making boost with 5.1 assists per contest, another first place in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Irvine is UCSB’s biggest threat on the defensive end, the Matadors are certainly the top threat on offense with their harrowing attack. CSUN ties UCSB in first with 77.8 points per game while passing the ball better than any other team in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing holding CSUN back? Its sluggish defense. The Matadors are last in opponent field goal percentage, allowing a massive 82.9 points per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be some kinks to smooth out but CSUN is a contender for the long hall with a trio of young, ambitious attackers and new leadership at the helm.</span></p>\n<p><b>Long Beach State, 6-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tied for fourth in the conference with two other squads, the 49ers look to turn their season around come conference play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beach has relied on the dynamic offensive production by senior guard Deishuan Booker who has posted 14.2 points per contest, the third most in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the paint, redshirt senior center Temidayo Yussuf drags down 7.2 rebounds per game for the Niners as he contributes 12.9 points on average. Yussuf shoots at the seventh best rate in the Big West, knocking down 49.7 percent on field goals, but Long Beach still struggles offensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Niners have shot just 41.7 percent from the field this season, the lowest mark in the Big West, while they fail to take care of the ball as well, with conference-high 16.0 turnovers per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While CSUN appears to be in first-place contention for years to come with a trio of talented young players, Long Beach seems to be searching for its next generation of studs as all three of its top leading scorers are seniors and will depart from the program next year.</span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside, 5-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk about a team that can shoot the three well. Between junior guard Dikymbe Martin and sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy, the Highlanders have one of the most dangerous three-point duos in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin is the only double-digit scorer on the Highlanders with 15.9 points per game as the fifth best scorer in the conference, but he also hits on 44.8 percent from behind the arc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Kennedy, the sophomore out of Moreno Valley owns the most efficient three-point percentage in the conference, shooting 56.3 percent from deep along with his 7.5 points per game which is second on the Riverside roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just a hundredth of a percent behind UC Irvine, Riverside is second in the Big West in shooting from the perimeter with 37 percent but struggles to get second chance opportunities on misses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody on the Highlanders roster brings down over 4.5 rebounds per game as UCR is the second worst rebounding team in the Big West, solely in front of last-place UC Davis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expect minimal post play while jumpers are hoisted from deep since the Highlanders shoot the most three-pointers in the Big West. But who can blame them? With a pair of spot-up shooters like Martin and Kennedy, all eyes should be around the perimeter. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cal Poly, 4-9</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs have hit a metaphorical wall in the world of Big West basketball. The last time Cal Poly had a winning team was during the 2012-13 season and coming off a 9-22 year, Poly showed that this season is more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not all bad for the Mustangs who have a leader in senior point guard Donovan Fields who posts 15.8 points per game to go along with 4.3 assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, sophomore wing Mark Crowe is a dynamic threat from virtually anywhere on the floor as he shoots the fifth best rate from the field in the Big West while also splashing 51.6 percent from range, No. 2 in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, much like the Highlanders, Cal Poly doesn’t have a solid facilitator to protect the restricted area in its strife to get rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only two of Cal Poly’s four wins have come against Division I programs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of those schools is playing its first season in Division I.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cal State Fullerton, 4-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off of a Cinderella Big West Tournament last season that ultimately landed them in March Madness, Fullerton loaded its front half of the season with difficult matchups throughout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans have a pair of two of the most effective scorers in the Big West as seniors [[senior guards]] Kyle Allman Jr. and Khalil Ahmad pose significant threats to any defense. Allman Jr. adds 18.5 points per game while Ahmad follows close behind with 18.2 on average. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With junior forward Jackson Rowe averaging 7.2 rebounds per game in the post, the third most in the Big West, Fullerton seems to have all the bases covered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the lingering question remains: what the heck is this team doing wrong? My answer: playing teams that are, quite simply, better than them. Fullerton gets little to no production from its offense, barring the three aforementioned starters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, with a dangerous offense, don’t count out the Titans. CSUF looks like the ideal team to impede a playoff-hopeful team with its dynamic scoring duo, so make sure to remember the Titans when they face off against top teams in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis, 4-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting in dead last, the Aggies have suffered a heartbreaking year. Heading into 2018-19, Davis had eyed a repeat crown as Big West regular season champions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies returned every starter from last year’s first place roster, but the results are drastically different. Davis hasn’t won a game on the road this season, going a shocking 0-7 when playing away this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With senior forward AJ John out with an injury halfway through the season, senior guard and 2017-18 Big West MVP TJ Shorts II is left to bear the scoring burden. His 14.2 points per game just haven’t been enough to carry the Aggies’ struggling offense, which scores only 62.9 points each contest, the least in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies have trouble shooting from deep and have been unable to match teams on the boards with a -3.6 rebounding margin, another Big West Conference low. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On paper, the Aggies should be a fierce competitor with 2017-18 Coach of the Year Jim Les at the helm but on the hardwood, finding points have been slim pickings, something they hope will turn around come Big West play. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

comfortable as ever after winning three straight at home and finishing off non-conference play with a 109-47 monster victory over visiting Bethesda, the largest point differential in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>The 109 points posted by UCSB is the most points by a Gaucho team since a 109-point performance on Nov. 30, 1985.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Ami Lakoju and freshman standout Sekou Touré each contributed double-double performances in the win as six Gauchos scored in double-figures, securing the top spot in the Big West heading into conference play with an 11-3 overall record. Bethesda dropped its ninth straight to fall to 1-13 on the year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In Lakoju’s first start of the season, the senior posted 16 points which tied a career-high mark while adding 11 rebounds for a season-high performance on the boards. However, during a night when the Chos’ most senior player popped off for a career performance, it was the young Gaucho talent that put on a show for the home crowd.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Amadou Sow, Lakoju’s frontcourt counterpart, continued to impress as he returned to the hardwood with a 14-point performance in 13 minutes while shooting 5-6 from the field. This followed his 21-point, 9 rebound night against University of San Francisco which earned him Big West Conference Athlete of the Week last Monday on December 31st.</p>\n<p>Sow has been on a tear in his freshman season. Having started all 14 games for the Gauchos, he sits atop the Big West in field goal percentage shooting 58.2% and nabs 6.4 rebounds per game good for No. 7 in the conference.</p>\n<p>Amadou Sow isn’t the only Prolific Prep product that has been mesmerizing for the Gaucho faithful to follow this season however. Sekou Touré has been premier off the bench for UCSB, and he continued to impress with 18 points and 11 rebounds, each career-high marks in the Bethesda clobbering.</p>\n<p>Touré has the highest player efficiency rating in the Big West and has competed for the top spot in the NCAA the entire season while topping out at No. 5 in the country. While Touré poured in a magnificent performance off the bench, it was freshman Jay Nagle who stole the show in the second half.</p>\n<p>Nagle, a sniper from deep, erupted for a career-high 20 points off the bench while shooting 6-12 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>The freshman forward was recruited at 6-foot-6 inches, but following a growth spurt over the summer now towers at 6-foot-8, and has displayed his impressive range with the No. 3 three-point percentage in the Big West splashing 46.2% from the perimeter.</p>\n<p>The three Gaucho freshmen combined for 52 points and 20 rebounds in the seventh straight Thunderdome win as UCSB remains a perfect 7-0 at home this season.</p>\n<p>Following an underdog win over Mid-Major No.10 University of San Francisco to catapult UCSB into first place in the Big West, the Gauchos have been earning mid-major top-25 votes while dominating throughout their non-conference schedule.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos rank atop the Big West with 77.8 points scored per game while shooting a conference-best 48.1% on field goals. A +45 rebound margin in this last matchup also puts them at a +9.8 differential this season, another best in the Big West. With only 9 turnovers against Bethesda, and consecutive games with single-digit turnovers for the offense, the Gauchos also hold the lowest mark for giveaways in the conference heading into the second half of the season.</p>\n<p>For the second straight year under Joe Pasternack, UCSB heads into Big West play with an 11-3 record whilst sitting in the No. 1 spot of the conference as it shifts attention to familiar Big West foes.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will open Big West play at home in the Thunderdome against the Cal Poly Mustangs for the most recent chapter on the highly-anticipated Blue-Green Rivalry on Wednesday, January 9 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

In terms of how the team’s overall record fares in the Big West standings, the Gauchos are currently ranked second, three wins behind top of the table UC Irvine who have played three more games than them.</p>\n<p>As for Idaho State, the Bengals’ overall record is a split 4-4, good enough to place them in the middle of the Big Sky Conference standings. Idaho State will also be looking to return to form as they too are coming off a most recent loss. On Wednesday, the Bengals fell short to Utah Valley University, which ended in a 77-88 defeat on the road.</p>\n<p>This will be the sixth time that these programs have faced off against each other. The Gauchos just barely edge out the Bengals in regards to their all-time series record, with the blue and gold leading 3-2.</p>\n<p>Players to watch for the Gauchos are graduate guard Ar’mond Davis and junior guard Max Heidegger.</p>\n<p>Davis has been on an absolute tear as of late and leads the Gauchos in scoring with a total of 165 points to his name on the year, 36 points ahead of sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin who is in second place.</p>\n<p>As for Heidegger, he’s slowly returning to form after recently playing in his first two games of the season during the road trip that  just concluded. For the mean time, head coach Joe Pasternack will keep rotating between Heidegger and sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey to take care of backcourt duties.</p>\n<p>On the opposing end, Bengal junior guard Brandon Boyd leads his side in scoring for the season with 129 total points. Averaging 16.1 in points per game, Boyd also leads Idaho State in assists, with a total of 31 on the year. That being said, his turnover count is also team-leading and the Gauchos will want to game plan against such a knack for mistakes.</p>\n<p>Fans will be excited for the Gauchos’ return to the Thunderdome and the commencement of their long stay. In turn, men’s basketball would like to start their home series on the right foot and give supporters something to celebrate during this most wonderful time of the year.</p>\n<p>It’s a day game on the cards for the Gauchos, as men’s basketball is eager to host the visiting Idaho State Bengals. Tipoff is scheduled for 2 PM this Saturday, December 22, at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85409\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85409\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-22/ucsb-returns-to-the-thunderdome-to-take-on-idaho-state/","id":105,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[104,103,102],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Lineups Ahead?

After the game, UCSB will return home for a nice five-game home stand which stretches into the start of Big West play.</p>\n<p>On top of having just a 4-7 record to start the season, the Mavericks will have a tall task in front of them as UCSB’s star guard Max Heidegger has finally recovered from a concussion he sustained earlier this year. The junior made his return for the Gauchos last weekend in a 99-89 overtime win against Rice University after he missing the first nine games of the season.</p>\n<p>Nebraska Omaha sports three players who average double-digits in the points column with senior guard Zach Jackson spearheading the attack, averaging 18.1 points per contest on a very efficient 50.8% shooting from the field.

It was the first time this year Jackson was held under double figures.</p>\n<p>Junior guard JT Gibson is Jackson’s back court compliment who averages 13.9 points per game. In all but two games either Jackson or Gibson has led the team in scoring after each game.</p>\n<p>Jaquori McLaughlin will likely get the assignment on Jackson as he gets the most difficult defensive matchup game-by-game and usually excels in shutting down the opposing teams’ top scorer.</p>\n<p>Offensively, McLaughlin reaped the benefits of Heidegger’s return back to action as the sophomore accounted for 22 points in the win against Rice. Even more impressive, McLaughlin’s three-point shot finally came alive as he shot a season best 6-8 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>As for Heidegger the guard’s return to the court was near flawless. Not only did Heidegger improve the Gauchos offensive production with his scoring ability but his mere presence on the court stretches the floor and creates opportunities both on the perimeter and in the paint.</p>\n<p>Before Max’s return, team captain Devearl Ramsey was producing more with his ball distributing than his scoring ability, but with Heidegger on the floor, Ramsey was able to get more open looks from deep as he went 5-7 from the perimeter en route to a career-high 21 points.</p>\n<p>Against Rice, Ramsey contributed eight of the first 10 points in OT to ultimately clinch the win for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The most enticing aspect of Heidegger’s return has to be the uncertainty about the starting roster. While this Gaucho team is deeper than any UCSB squad in recent memory, is Joe Pasternack gutsy enough to have Heidegger come off the bench?</p>\n<p>Before Heidegger’s return, UCSB still held a very strong 7-2 overall record and were a few plays away from securing an upset win at Washington showing that this is a team that was able to produce throughout his absence.</p>\n<p>Heidegger improves the Gauchos offense when in the game highlighted by their season high 99-point performance on Saturday, but as a result the defense can sometimes suffer due to the junior guard’s tendency to constantly push the tempo and speed up the pace of play.</p>\n<p>The problem with playing at such a high pace is that it sometimes gives opponents the opportunity to match and put up more points. To that point, the Gauchos gave up a season high 89 points to the Owls.</p>\n<p>However, it’s tough to make the case against starting forwards senior Jarriesse Blackmon and graduate Armond Davis. According to ESPN’s college basketball index, Blackmon has the fourth highest player efficiency rating (PER), a measure that assesses a player’s production based on the minutes they play, in the Big West at 19.76 while Davis’s 18.49 PER follows close behind ranking sixth.</p>\n<p>Davis, Blackmon, and freshman forward Amadou Sow all post a top-15 PER in the Big West conference while Devearl Ramsey and Jaquori Mclaughlin are close behind. Funnily enough, freshman standout Sekou Toure has been the most efficient player in the Big West with a 33.57 PER which also ranks 10<sup>th</sup> in the country underlining how strong the Gauchos are all around.</p>\n<p>All this is to say that Head Coach Joe Pasternack has a litany of options this season, something that was a bit of a struggle last year. Last season, Heidegger played nearly 33 minutes a game, most nights more, and it caught up to him at the end of the season.</p>\n<p>This time around, Pasternack has a team that could go nearly 11-deep making them a major threat not just in the Big West but to any opponent. Heidegger’s talent obviously warrants him starting but now he no longer needs to play excessive minutes and some nights he could even come off the bench to give him a break.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, this Gaucho team is at full strength and it will be interesting to see what exactly that entails both at the start and off the bench.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face Nebraska Omaha at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, December 19 at Baxter Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Max Heidegger made his long-anticipated season debut in Houston, Texas on Saturday as the UCSB men’s basketball team held off the Rice University Owls in a 99-89 overtime thriller.</p>\n<p>Although questions arose about how the star guard would insert himself back into the Gauchos rotation, Heidegger’s return to the attack was as smooth as the Gauchos three-point stroke from deep. UCSB knocked down 48.6% of perimeter shots as they opened the game on a 12-0 run from four straight triples including two that came from sophomore Jaquori Mclaughlin.</p>\n<p>Mclaughlin finished with 22 points while shooting 7-10 on field goals. He hit on a game-high 6-8 from three in addition to tallying four assists in the process. His starting backcourt counterpart sophomore Devearl Ramsey was magnificent leading the Gaucho’s attack in crunch time, as he added 8 points right off the bat in overtime en route to a career-high 21-point night with five three pointers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[Devearl] had 3 assists and one turnover. All I care about is don’t turn the ball over,” chimed Head Coach Joe Pasternack after the game. “We get him to go 5-7 from three… that’s a bonus, that’s huge. We needed every single one of them.”</p>\n<p>Down 12 points within the first 2 minutes to open the game, the Owls clawed back and took command with a 31-7 stretch to put Rice up 31-19 with 4:21 to play in the first half. The scoring stretch was capped off by a three-point play by freshman guard Chris Mullins who added 21 points in 40 minutes for the Owls and while going 6-16 from the field.</p>\n<p>Each team traded jumpers as the half ticked to a close with Rice up by 10 in the final second. With just a flash of time on the clock, Heidegger muscled the ball past the timeline and drew a shooting foul from three with just .1 seconds left. The Oaks Christian High School product sunk all three free-throws and moved the Gauchos within 7, down 39-32 at the break.</p>\n<p>Heidegger immediately assumed a quarterback role in the attack whenever he came on the floor. In his return, the preseason first team All-Big West Conference honoree added 22 points in 29 minutes off of the bench while shooting 6-16 from the field.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho’s offense lit up at the start of the half as they opened up on a 13-2 scoring run in which Devearl Ramsey and Heidegger collaborated for 11 of 13 out of the gate in the second half.</p>\n<p>Just minutes after entering the half off the bench, Heidegger put an exclamation mark on the Gauchos opening push when he connected with consecutive threes as he launched the latter from over 35-feet out to put UCSB on top for the first time since the 11-minute mark in the first half.</p>\n<p>Following a trio of free-throws from graduate guard Armond Davis with 13:16 on the clock, the momentum had officially shifted as the visiting Gaucho’s had now taken a 50-45 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB silenced the crowd with its suffocating defense on the ensuing possession which forced a telegraphed pass from freshman guard Trey Murphy III. Just in front of the midline, senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon jumped in front of Murphy’s feed and finished with a flush in transition on the other end.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos continued their offensive production spearheaded by the Mclaughlin-Heidegger attack in the second half, Chris Mullins and junior Robert Martin finished with 10 and 11 points respectively to set the scene for a last-ditch comeback in the final 4 minutes.</p>\n<p>Following a quick release trey from Mclaughlin with 3:41 left on the clock, the Owls finished off regulation with a 9-2 run that sent the Saturday matinee matchup into overtime at 77-77.</p>\n<p>Devearl Ramsey took matters into his own hands as the game made its way into extra time. Ramsey dazzled by adding 8 points in the first minute and a half as he splashed two from downtown along with a driving teardrop at the rack to put UCSB up 87-82.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos carried their lead to the finish line as they went 10-10 from the stripe in overtime to close out the thriller. SB hit 23 of 24 free throws compared to the Owls who went 18-34 from the line.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter who you’re playing; the same things matter. Do you hit your free throws on the road? In Washington we didn’t. Here we went 23 of 24 from the free throw line,” said Coach Pasternack. “You can’t turn the ball over on the road and we had nine turnovers; one of our best performances of the year.”</p>\n<p>Five Gauchos finished in double-digits with Heidegger, Mclaughlin, and Devearl Ramsey all ending the night with more than 20 points. Armond Davis joined in with 10 while freshman forward Amadou Sow went a perfect 6-6 from the field on his way to a 12-point night.</p>\n<p>The ‘Chos away game at Rice was Santa Barbara’s penultimate

in comparison to the other Big West Conference opponents, UCSB is ranked second overall in the standings, only a pair of wins behind UC Irvine who have played two more games than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As for the hosting Rice Owls, they’ll want to pick up the pace as their 4-6 overall record has proven subpar. They will, however, be coming off their most recent victory against a St. Edward’s side, which ended in favor of the hosts by a final score of 78-73.</p>\n<p>Although, before that win the Owls were on a four-game losing streak that they’ll want to forget about as soon as possible. In terms of conference standings, under Conference USA, they find themselves in the bottom third overall.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, UCSB has faced Rice two times in the program’s past, and have never dropped a game in that time; with their last meeting occurring back in 1973. Away games are always tricky to speculate on, but the Gauchos will look to continue their winning ways and maintain their undefeated status over the Owls.</p>\n<p>Defense has been the main point of emphasis for this Gauchos side in recent weeks, and it has definitely paid off. However, following the most recent UAPB match, the team will want to limit turnovers as much as possible and capitalize on scoring opportunities as they come.</p>\n<p>In terms of players to watch for the Gauchos, two guards have now passed the 100-point mark this far through the season. First, graduate Ar’mond Davis leads his side in scoring with a total of 129 points on the year. Sophomore JaQuori McLaughlin, who is first in minutes played for UCSB, is second in scoring with a total of 100 flat to his name. Speaking of sophomore guards, Devearl Ramsey continues to shine in his playmaker role, in Max Heidegger’s absence; Ramsey is tied, with McLaughlin, for leading UCSB in assists, with a total 34 already.</p>\n<p>On the opposition’s end, the Gauchos will have to deal with four different scorers who have all surpassed the 100-point mark for the Owls. Leading in scoring is Rice’s junior guard, Ako Adams, who has made 124 total points; Adams also leads his side in playmaking with 33 assists so far through the season. Graduate forward Jack Williams will be another key player that the Gauchos will have to contend against on both sides of the court.</p>\n<p>At 6’8”, Williams was one of those four plus 100-point scorers, with 106 to his name, and he is also the Owls’ leading rim protector; the big man boasts 73 total rebounds, 17 of which were on offensive and the remaining 56 on defense.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to Tudor Fieldhouse, in Houston, Texas, for their matchup against Rice University. Tipoff off time is this Saturday, December 15, at 12 PM noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

College Cup at Harder Stadium. Maryland comes into the matchup with an 11-6-4 record, while Indiana sports a 20-2-1 mark for the season.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers and the Terps are well-acquainted with one another as they have met twice already this season, with Indiana emerging victorious both times.</p>\n<p>The first meeting came in Bloomington, Ind., during Big Ten Conference play when the Hoosiers escaped with a 2-1 win, thanks to a last-minute goal by senior defenseman Andrew Gutman. The second matchup between the two teams came in the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament, during which Indiana again edged out the Terps in penalty kicks. Both matches came down to the wire and could have gone either way, save for a few miscues and lucky bounces that ultimately went the way of Indiana.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If the game on Friday is also a defensive battle, then it seems that the Hoosiers will have the advantage yet again. They haven’t allowed a goal so far in NCAA play and don’t show any signs of loosening their stringent backline.</p>\n<p>Indiana was just as stingy during conference play, in which they led the league in shutouts (12) and goals against (11). They haven’t lost since Oct. 3, and their effort on the defensive end is a big reason why.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and Gutman have been the main players commandeering defense this season, and both already have years of experience competing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Gutman, in particular, has been the main leader of this Indiana squad. He hasn’t been just a defensive anchor; he also has been pulling his weight on the offensive end as well. The defender leads the team in goals (11) and is second in the Big Ten Conference.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers have a loaded roster that contains four first-team All-Big Ten players as well as four second-team players. Goalie Trey Muse has only allowed 11 goals on the season, putting him en route to be named the best goalie in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>Indiana has historically been a fixture in the College Cup. This is its second consecutive year qualifying for the Cup and its NCAA-record 20th time qualifying overall.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers last won the championship in 2012 — the most recent victory for any of the teams in the Final Four — and have nine titles overall.</p>\n<p>Even with such an illustrious history, this year’s team is definitely unique.</p>\n<p>“This group is a special one amongst the teams we have had,” Head Coach Todd Yeagley explained. “The numbers certainly speak for themselves. They’re very focused, just a wonderful group to coach.”</p>\n<p>So far this season, Indiana emerged victorious from the Big Ten Tournament with a 3-0 victory over Michigan in the title game and thus earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. After receiving a first-round bye, the Hoosiers flexed their muscles against UConn in their second-round matchup, winning the game 4-0 in a match that was never in doubt.</p>\n<p>Their second game of the tournament pitted them against Air Force, and the Hoosiers again got off to an early lead with two goals scored within the first 22 minutes of action. From there the Hoosiers rode their defense and held Air Force scoreless for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Indiana’s quarterfinal matchup came against its interstate rival and the No. 7 team in the country, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In their prior meeting, Indiana squeaked out a 2-1 overtime win in South Bend, and Notre Dame was looking for revenge. This game was a battle of two defenses, as neither team could put the ball in the net until the 63-minute mark when Austin Panchot gave the Hoosiers the go-ahead and ultimately the game-winning score.</p>\n<p>Maryland is led by a pair of first-team All-Big Ten players in senior midfielder and leading goal scorer Amar Sejdic and junior defenseman Donovan Pines. Although they are a familiar foe, Indiana is certainly not taking them lightly.</p>\n<p>“You can’t take one thing away from Maryland and feel like you’ve solved them,” Yeagley said. “I feel that is a strength of our team as well. There are a lot of mirroring qualities between these two teams.”</p>\n<p>These two squads have definitely earned the right to play on this stage, and if their prior meetings are any indication, we should prepare for another hard-fought battle that comes down to the wire.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

The Spartans have only one loss on the road this season, which came in Fort Wayne, Indiana as the Hoosiers knocked off the green and white in a 1-0 overtime thriller.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>MSU has thrived since its last game against a Big Ten foe as the Spartans are winners of four straight matches heading into the Final Four this weekend. Following a first-round win against the University of Chicago, Illinois with a 2-0 victory, Michigan State found itself matched up against No. 4 Louisville in the second round.</p>\n<p>The Spartans got out to an early lead in the 16th minute as freshman midfielder Jack Beck received a lead from senior forward Ryan Sierakowski on a breakaway hook to the bottom right-hand corner. Louisville was able to tie it up one goal apiece with a strike in the 77th minute that ultimately forced the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>Just two minutes into extra time, junior midfielder Giuseppe Barone sent a free kick from the left side into the six. Louisville bobbled a crucial clearance as senior defenseman John Freitag netted a walk-off finish that propelled Michigan State to its second Sweet 16 appearance in as many seasons.</p>\n<p>In game three of the playoffs, sophomore midfielder Michael Miller lasered a first-half strike from 35 yards out, which was all the Spartans needed to edge out the win against No. 13 Georgetown with a slim 1-0 shutout. Georgetown peppered off five shots in the final five-minute frame, but their comeback attack fell short as the Spartans advanced to their second consecutive Elite 8 appearance.</p>\n<p>James Madison University struck early in its Quarter-Finals matchup with Michigan State as Dukes’ junior defensive midfielder Niclas Mohr snuck a dribbler past senior keeper Jimmy Hague for one of only two goals that Hague has allowed during the postseason tournament.</p>\n<p>As the Spartans’ season was dwindling at point-blank range, Sierakowski took matters into his own hands as he lifted the ball just over a diving Dukes keeper to tie the game up at 1-1 with less than 20 minutes to play.</p>\n<p>Under 10 minutes later, Sierakowski was back for vengeance again as the Spartans made a game-winning drive down the pitch. Senior defender Connor Corrigan lofted a long, arcing pass up to redshirt sophomore defender Patrick Nielsen who corralled the feed and found Sierakowski in the box for a split-second look.</p>\n<p>Sierakowski made a snap decision as he read the keeper’s range from three yards out. With a hesitation move and a swift heel touch, the veteran striker finessed a curl around Dukes goalkeeper TJ Bush that capped off the 2-1 comeback and sent the Spartans to their first Final Four appearance in 50 years.</p>\n<p>In his senior year, Sierakowski has been premier on the attack for the Spartans as the McHenry, Illi. native has delivered eight goals and five assists in 22 games this season while leading the Spartans past a mighty Big Ten Conference that boasted four teams that were selected to participate in the 2018 NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The Big Ten commands the Final Four this season as Michigan State, University of Maryland and University of Indiana make up three of the remaining four teams still in the running to take home the College Cup.</p>\n<p>Ryan Sierakowski finished the season as the No. 4 goal scorer in the Big Ten Conference and in the No. 5 spot for overall points as well with a team-leading 21 points on the season. On top of that, his four game winners on the season were tied for second in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>The dangerous forward is complimented well by a playmaking Barone who ranks second in the conference in assists with 10 on the year. Barone is an elusive 5’9’’ attacking mid that powers the Spartan charge with 16 points tallied this year, which was good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>As if the Sierakowski-Barone one-two punch wasn’t enough, senior forward and Michigan native DeJuan Jones has posted five goals along with five assists in 2018 to round out a deadly triangle rotation for MSU.</p>\n<p>The trio of experience led Michigan State to the No. 2 in the Big Ten Conference in both total points with 112 and goals on the year with 35 goals in 22 games.</p>\n<p>Holding it down on the defensive end for Sparta, Hague owns the No. 1 goalkeeping mark in the Big Ten with 79 saves this year, putting him on a track for nine shutout performances in the 22 games he started for the Spartans. His nine blanks this season are tied for No. 9 in the nation among Division I goalies.</p>\n<p>Hague’s .840 save percentage is the best in the conference and No. 10 in the NCAA, while his .66 goals allowed per match is No. 2 in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>With a stout Spartans backline that only allows .77 goals per contest, the best way to slow down Michigan State is to limit its sharp attack.</p>\n<p>Yet with Ryan Sierakowski spearheading the attack and a fearsome duo in Barone and Jones at Sierakowski’s immediate disposal, this Spartan squad looks to ride its unforeseen tournament run to its first title in 50 years.</p>\n<p>The Michigan State Spartans will take on University of Akron in the first game of the Final Four on Dec. 7 at 5 p.m. at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85318\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85318\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/","id":1328,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1327,1326,1325],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Akron Hopes for Second Cinderella Finish in ‘Soccer Heaven’","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/team-DSC_8602.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/team-DSC_8602.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The last time Akron was in Santa Barbara for a College Cup the Zips won their first title in program history.

The four wins were just enough for Akron to nab one of the 48 spots in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>After a play-in win against Rider University, Akron faced Syracuse, a team that defeated them earlier in the year, 3-1. Akron flipped the script, though, and won at top-seeded Wake Forest and ninth-ranked Stanford to launch them into the Final Four.</p>\n<p>That is the beauty of sports: One week the season feels over and yet, if the right changes are made, the next week you could be right back in the thick of things.</p>\n<p>“Going into the season, we had expectations of being here, but how the season went, around midseason it didn’t look like we would make the tournament, let alone make a run,” Head Coach Jared Embick said. “But we always knew we could get right back into it, and we did.”</p>\n<p>It also only feels fitting that Akron returns to the place it has won its only title — Santa Barbara — something coach Embick doesn’t take for granted.</p>\n<p>“Everyone gets excited to make it to the last week of the season, and it’s great to be in a sunny, wonderful place like Santa Barbara,” Embick said.</p>\n<p>The last time Akron was in Santa Barbara for the College Cup, the SB fans really seemed to gravitate toward the Zips. In fact, in 2010 when Akron scored its only goal to defeat Louisville, many fans threw tortillas onto the field, a celebration usually meant only for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Us mid-majors have to stick together,” Emrick said while laughing.</p>\n<p>“In all seriousness, it was a great memory and hopefully we can draw from that experience and pump our guys up. We are hoping some of the same people and a few others do the same thing this year.”</p>\n<p>In general, Akron also enjoys a lot of success in Santa Barbara. Last year, the Zips defeated the Gauchos 3-1 in a game that saw Akron then-forward Sam Gainford score two goals.</p>\n<p>“We consider this place our home away from home. Our guys have had success on this turf, and we are really excited to keep that up,” Embick said. “We always approach this place with good memories, and hopefully we use that to our advantage this weekend.”</p>\n<p>There is no doubt Akron’s confidence is at an all-time high, and honestly, why shouldn’t it be?  The Zips have won eight straight matches, they have knocked off some of the best teams in the country to get to the Final Four and they are returning to a place in which they have had much success.</p>\n<p>It might be easy to get carried away and think Akron is destined to win, but coach Embick is not so quick to say so.</p>\n<p>“As a coach you always temper excitement, but given everything we have done this season we have proven we are capable of getting it done,” Embick said. “Some people tossed us aside earlier this year, and we have proven we deserve to be here, but now we have to get it done.”</p>\n<p>Akron first needs to reach its fourth final in program history by defeating Michigan State, a team that is making its own history by being in its first College Cup in 50 years. The Zips defeated the Spartans earlier this year, 2-1.</p>\n<p>Also, if you didn’t believe in coincidences enough, Akron knocked off the other Michigan team, the Wolverines, in 2010 before winning their first title. That same year, they also beat Michigan in the regular season, 7-1.</p>\n<p>“I have already told our guys about how we beat a team from Michigan first last time we were here and how funny everything seems to be playing out,” Embick said. “Hopefully that is a good omen, and hopefully we get it done.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Curry, Akron University has become one of the most respected schools in the world of college soccer.</p>\n<p>Since 2007 the Zips have tallied an NCAA-best 203-42-29 record. Combined with an NCAA championship appearance in 2009 and trophy in 2010, they’ve arguably put together one of the most dominant 10-year stretches in the history of the sport.</p>\n<p>Akron also has had the most players selected in the MLS draft in the last 10 years, with big names such as Newcastle RB Deandre Yedlin headlining an impressive set of alumni. After a dominant 2017 season in which they won the M.A.C. conference championship yet eventually fell to No. 1 Stanford in the College Cup Semifinals, expectations were high heading into the 2018 season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Zips didn’t quite start off the season the way they wanted to. Early non-conference losses to NC State, Seattle University and Washington didn’t have too much of an effect on Akron’s overall ranking, but the team still didn’t have a winning record a month into the season.</p>\n<p>A quick three-game win streak at the end of September, along with big wins over ranked opponents Michigan State and Creighton in early October helped the Zips evade the bottom of the M.A.C. standings.</p>\n<p>They ended the conference season with a 1-0 win over SIU Edwardsville and a fourth-place finish in the conference to go along with their No. 14 national rank. Even though three teams finished ahead of the Zips in total points, they finished the season leading the conference in goals (42), shutouts (8) and assists (22).</p>\n<p>“We had our ups and downs during the season,” explained senior goalie Ben Lundt. “But when we realized that we [just had to] take every game 90 minutes [at a time], we realized that we could beat any team anywhere.”</p>\n<p>Akron floated through their conference tournament, outscoring their opponents 8-2 and earning a spot in the NCAA College Cup. The Zips dominated both Rider University and No. 20 Syracuse 3-1 in their first two games. They then squeaked by No. 2 Wake Forest 1-0 to set up an Elite Eight matchup with the No. 2 ranked Stanford Cardinal that had knocked them out of the tournament the year before. Akron ended up getting their revenge and beating the Cardinal 3-2 to advance to the Semifinals where they are now set to take on a familiar foe in Michigan State.</p>\n<p>A player to watch in this matchup will be Akron sophomore forward David Egbo. Egbo led the team and conference in both goals (12) and overall points (29), and he will be looking to make a mark in the late stages of the College Cup for the first time in his young career.</p>\n<p>The forward made a monstrous improvement of 11 goals and one assist from his freshman year, and although he hasn’t had a breakout game so far in the postseason, he definitely is due.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Marcel Zajac has also been dominant on the offensive end for the Zips. Although he is second in the conference in goals (10) only behind his teammate Egbo, Zajac has also taken on the mantle of a playmaker.</p>\n<p>The forward led the team in assists this year and was tied for fourth in the conference (8). Although his goal total shows that he is capable of taking and making shots on his own, Zajac has seemingly unlocked another level to this Akron offense by focusing on being a distributor. With Egbo up top ready to knock in any ball close to the goal, Zajac has made sure that his teammates stay involved as well as maintained the synergy between the forwards and midfielders on his team.</p>\n<p>This teamwide synergy has been one of Akron’s greatest strengths all season. The team’s game-winning goal last week against Stanford went viral on Twitter, not because of the goal itself, but because of the 34 consecutive passes leading up to it.</p>\n<p>“The strength [of this team] is their collective spirit,” Head Coach Jared Embick explained in his pre-Cup press conference. “They’re really together, and they fight like heck out there. When they do that, the talent comes through. When they focus on that fighting spirit and being a team, you see what we could do out there.”</p>\n<p>One drawback to this focus on a teamwide offense and more European-style passing is that the Zips’ goal scoring can stagnate when faced with a defense that is content with letting them play with the ball. Against a hungry Michigan State squad making their first appearance in the Final Four in 50 years, Akron will have to be able to push the place and play rougher than usual.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Zips seem like a good bet to win the College Cup. The combination of Final Four experience that the players from last year’s team have with breakout performances by their young stars this year makes this one of the most balanced teams in the country.</p>\n<p>As they get set to take on a familiar foe in an unfamiliar environment, Akron has a special chance for a storybook ending to a decade of dominance.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

in his twentieth year as head coach of the UCSB men’s soccer program, set down his keys on the table in the College Cup room situated under the east end of a now-empty Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>He faced the local media to discuss all that went wrong in their Big West Tournament quarterfinal versus Cal State Fullerton, which saw the visiting Titans advance to the semifinal after a penalty kick shootout.</p>\n<p>These season-ending press conferences have become par for the course for Vom Steeg and the Gauchos over the past three years as they’ve fallen short of reaching the NCAA Tournament

drought of this length is rare.</p>\n<p>In the three years since UCSB’s last appearance in the NCAA Tournament when they fell to Clemson in the Round of 16, each season’s Gaucho team has seen their campaign end in disappointment come conference tournament time. This year’s Gauchos became the latest to join that group.</p>\n<p>As unsuccessful as the Gauchos have been in recent times, there’s a recipe for success to make it back to the grand stage of the College Cup. It’s simple on the surface, but it wouldn’t be the crown jewel of college soccer if it didn’t require perfect execution by the four teams that make it that far.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactics: Outsmarting the Opponent</strong></p>\n<p><em>“That’s been our issue all year. What’s been that ‘something different’ that can get us a goal?”</em></p>\n<p>vom Steeg has the expertise and know-how to have the upper hand against any opponent, but as good a problem as it is to have so much talent at his disposal, it was also a nightmare to figure out what formation would get the most out of his team.</p>\n<p>Throughout, he worked with four different formations: first a 4-2-3-1, then a 3-5-2, onto a 4-4-2, and toward the end of the season shades of a 4-3-3.</p>\n<p>An argument can be made that UCSB played the best soccer of its season in any of the formations, but once the team got slightly exposed in one setup it was on to the next one.</p>\n<p>This constant tinkering hampered players who excelled in certain roles in one formation and struggled in others, and there was no regularity for the team to grow into a formation as a unit.</p>\n<p>One such example is senior defender and team captain Jan Ilskens. If he could be listed as a utility man, that would be a better descriptor since he’s been deployed as a center back, defensive midfielder, right back and even as a striker in the past two years.</p>\n<p>After starting the season as a right back in the 4-2-3-1, he moved to right center back in the 3-5-2. With the wingback spots occupied in the 4-4-2 by juniors Ignacio Tellechea and Noah Billingsley, he began to get some playing time up top to support sophomore Rodney Michael in the forward lines. Playing out of position in attack didn’t suit him, so he moved back into the defensive midfield in the 4-3-3.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency: Establishing Your Roles</strong></p>\n<p><em>“If you follow Gaucho soccer, scoring goals this year has always been an issue for us. When we scored goals, it usually happened in bunches.”</em></p>\n<p>The 2018 Gauchos certainly did score in bunches: Five times this year they managed to score multiple goals within a five-minute span. In the game against CSUN, it was vom Steeg’s tactical switch at halftime that worked to their favor as they scored a trio of goals in just seven minutes.</p>\n<p>Yet it was hard to spread the goals around the team and even harder to score on the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had just five players with multiple goals on the season. Of those five, freshman forward Carter Clemmensen’s goals were both in the opening weekend of play, and sophomore forward Kaya Fabbretti didn’t join the ranks until the final game of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s road woes were well-documented this season, but one statistic still seems unbelievable until it’s checked against the team’s results: the Gauchos failed to score in each of their six road losses.</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos scored, they got results. When they didn’t, they lost.</p>\n<p>It should be no surprise that Michael had a goal and two assists in the road win at New Mexico and draw at UC Irvine. This year’s team relied heavily on the sophomore and oftentimes struggled to find a Plan B.</p>\n<p>This was the result of an ever-shifting midfield and attack for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The backline became solidified very early on in the season, but each game saw a rotating cast providing support for Michael and Billingsley, seemingly the only two regulars in the attacking half of the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>UCSB played best when midfielders like junior Sahid Conteh and Fabbretti made deep runs and were able to contribute to the attack. When there’s so much talent and so many different styles of play vying for such few spots on the field, it can be difficult to implement one method of play over another. Injuries and suspensions didn’t help vom Steeg’s case either.</p>\n<p>Figuring out the perfect combination in both areas will be the biggest challenge for the Gaucho coaching staff heading into next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Luck: What Every Champion Needs</strong></p>\n<p><em>“Soccer is a sport that if you don’t feel like you’re going to score, then you don’t let the other team score, and then you leave it to the penalty spot and see what happens.”</em></p>\n<p>Part of the reason why UCSB hasn’t been able to make it back to the NCAA Tournament is simply down to luck.</p>\n<p>In any tournament setting, especially one with as small a sample size as three games like in the Big West Tournament, a deflection or a shot that hits the post or crossbar can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>\n<p>In this year’s quarterfinal against Fullerton, UCSB dominated possession in the second half of the game, but sophomore midfielder Carson Vom Steeg missed an open shot, and Michael failed to convert on an opportunity late in extra time.</p>\n<p>Lady (Bad) Luck struck again in the penalty shootout when junior forward Ignacio Tellechea hit the crossbar, ironically after scoring his first goal of the season earlier in the match to get them that far.</p>\n<p>Luck isn’t just a big factor in the conference tournament; the landscape in the Big West would have looked completely different if Michael hadn’t missed his penalty in the ninth minute at UC Irvine and the Gauchos didn’t have to come from behind to secure the 2-2 draw. If anything, it’s as important considering the college soccer season features so many games in such a small window.</p>\n<p>With so many players being introduced into the fold, it may have been far-fetched to think that everything would come together in just one year.</p>\n<p>Yet the hope remains. If Tim Vom Steeg gets all of this right and the Gauchos can get some luck on their side, the next trip to the College Cup might not be far off.</p>\n<p><em>Arthur Wilkie is the Sports Director at

Barbara had the privilege to host their first-ever NCAA College Cup. Despite some things not going as planned and some upgrades not being able to be finished in time, the event was a relative success.</p>\n<p>“We were asked back in 2010 to host in kind of a last-minute situation, and we sort of scrambled to get it done, but even today people look back at that college cup and hold it as a high watermark over the last 10-plus years,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>More than 9,600 people were packed in the stadium dubbed “Soccer Heaven” to witness Akron upset top-ranked Louisville 1-0. Now, as UCSB prepares to host the College Cup for the second time in school history, the university and its staff hope it can do an even better job.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s a great honor and a unique opportunity [to be the hosts of the college cup],” Vom Steeg said. “I love being a host, and I love the cycle of having one year off to relax and then getting another opportunity to do even better in 2020, but our focus this weekend is to do a good job.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg played a significant role in the College Cup making its way back to Santa Barbara. There were multiple reasons why vom Steeg felt he wanted the championship matches on his home turf.</p>\n<p>The first reason is that this is just the 10th time since 1959 (when the College Cup began) that it will be held on the West Coast and just the third since the turn of the century. Hosting the matches on the West Coast is great because usually, that means better weather in the winter, especially in a place like Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It’s really, really hard to have people come out in Philadelphia in the second week of December to watch Stanford and Indiana,” Vom Steeg said. “Great teams, great programs, but when it’s 20 degrees outside it is hard.”</p>\n<p>Even bigger than that, UCSB hopes to attract support for the College Cup being played at university campus stadiums instead of being held at big Major League Soccer (MLS) stadiums.</p>\n<p>“I understand why the Soccer Committee likes the MLS stadiums. They are usually in big cities next to big airports and they are made to hold big games, but over the last four years I have been one of the more vocal critics in that our championship doesn’t reflect our game,” vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Having participated in two College Cups himself, including UCSB’s historic 2006 championship, vom Steeg said he feels disappointed for coaches and athletes who work hard all year for a once-in-a-lifetime experience and the championship does not live up to the event.</p>\n<p>To vom Steeg’s point, the average attendance the past three championship games has been just over 5,300, much lower than UCSB’s 9,600-plus showing in 2010.</p>\n<p>Additionally, having such low attendance in big MLS stadiums makes for a much weaker atmosphere and feel to the game.</p>\n<p>In a site like UCSB’s Harder Stadium that seats about 16,500, according to UCSB’s Assistant Athletics Director for Communications Bill Mahoney, having about 9,600 fans will look full and help build a strong atmosphere for players and fans alike.</p>\n<p>But at a place like BBVA Compass Stadium, home of the Houston Dynamos and site of the 2016 College Cup Final, only 6,315 were in attendance. For a stadium seating 22,039, only about 29 percent of the stadium was full for a championship game.</p>\n<p>If the game was at a place like Harder, the stadium would’ve been at about 40 percent capacity. Not great, but still a huge difference, especially considering that vom Steeg and co. hope to garner a bigger attraction this year.</p>\n<p>“We are attempting to reverse the course of the last few years this weekend, and we are attempting to bring back the National Championship to a college campus and hopefully show everybody that this might be the better route,” vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>vom Steeg also said that even if the College Cup isn’t in Santa Barbara, as long as it is in a community that will support it and give the championship game the feel it deserves that would be a good thing.</p>\n<p>This year, in order to prepare for a good showing, UCSB has had to improve Harder Stadium quite a bit. Even though the Gauchos were hosts in 2010 vom Steeg notes that the past eight years very well could have been 20.</p>\n<p>“We literally had to start all over again. It takes a lot of work, but what we are hoping for this time around is being able to build off of this for the 2020 College Cup,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this process of hosting the College Cup, UCSB listed out 11 projects it wanted to get done, and vom Steeg said nine were able to be completed with the rest to be finished before the start of the next college season and certainly before the next College Cup.</p>\n<p>“When people show up to the field they are going to see Harder Stadium in the best shape it has ever been in, and a lot of these changes are permanent that our fans will be able to enjoy for years to come,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest improvements at Harder was the field,  investing $100,000 in it before the start of the season.</p>\n<p>Other changes include bringing in international goal posts, putting new MLS type benches, expanding benches, increasing seating area in the “gold” zone by about 125, a new sound system at the stadium, new sewer lines for the bathrooms, beautifying the entryway, expanding the press box for media and finishing painting both the inside and outside of the stadium.</p>\n<p>“The school really stepped up in helping improve the infrastructure of Harder, and it will go a long way,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>For 2020, some of the changes vom Steeg said UCSB will hope to implement is a new ticket booth, more improvements to the entryway, and the addition of a new video board.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend has a lot on the line for UCSB. Despite not being one of the final four teams, vom Steeg still sees both Friday and Sunday as huge opportunities to continue this course of action by having the College Cup at college campuses.</p>\n<p>“I certainly hope we at least match what we did in 2010, and I hope we put on a great event,” Vom Steeg said. “This weekend will mean a lot but also is a project because if this weekend goes great we know we can make it even better in 2020.”</p>\n<p>The College Cup will feature Michigan State, Akron, Indiana and Maryland. Michigan State will face Akron at 5 p.m. on Friday while Indiana and Maryland will play at 7:30 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n<p>The championship match will be played at 5 p.m. on Sunday, Dec. 9 at Harder between the two winners on Friday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

This year, the Terrapins have made easy work of their opponents through the NCAA Tournament thus far, achieving shutouts in all matches.</p>\n<p>Despite the story told by the numbers, No. 11 Maryland has knocked off nationally-ranked programs along the way. Most notably perhaps, is the Terps’ 1-0 victory over No. 3 Kentucky last Friday, Nov. 30. Not only shutting out the third-ranked team in the nation, but also doing so on the Wildcat’s home turf in Lexington demonstrates the momentum Maryland is riding heading into this year’s Final Four.</p>\n<p>Given Maryland’s success in the postseason this year, it may be assumed the team has been prospering since the season’s start in August. Contrarily, the Terps didn’t pick up their first win until they hosted West Virginia at home on Sep. 10, roughly two-and-a-half weeks into the season. Prior to its 1-0 shutout win over the Mountaineers, Maryland held a 0-2-2 record. Obviously an undesirable start for any team, the Terps still find themselves at the College Cup, thriving nonetheless.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After the team’s shaky start, Maryland has managed to culminate an 11-6-4 overall record; however, the narrative of the Terps’ season encompasses an element of growth. An overtime loss at home to Big Ten foe Wisconsin in September found the Terps deflated, sitting sub-.500 once again.</p>\n<p>The loss came only a week after Maryland earned its second consecutive win of the year to get to .500. Whether or not the Terrapins knew in September that they’d return to racking up consecutive wins when it mattered or not, the team bounced back from the Wisconsin loss, going 9-3-2 to reach the biggest stage of college soccer.</p>\n<p>Through their rejuvenation following the loss to the Badgers, the Terrapins mustered a 4-4 record in the competitive Big Ten conference. At the top of the Big Ten, this season is Indiana, boasting a perfect 8-0-0 conference record as part of its 20-2-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, the Hoosiers are who stand in Maryland’s way now as the two conference opponents are set to face off for the third time this season. This time, though, the stakes are much higher.</p>\n<p>Back in October, Indiana defeated the Terps 2-1, but November saw Maryland settle for a 1-1 tie against the Hoosiers in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament. It is since that 1-1 tie that the Terps have achieved three consecutive NCAA Tournament shutouts.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned victory over Kentucky stands as the most recent of upsets for Maryland, but a week prior to the taming of the Wildcats found the Terps defeating No. 10 Duke at home 2-0. The Blue Devils had no answer for Maryland, as they were met with the same fate that Kentucky arrived at a week later.</p>\n<p>The Terps may have an inclination to spoil opposing fans’ hopes on the road, but Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara will perhaps offer an even greater outcome to be coveted.</p>\n<p>Along with two winless games worth of potential revenge, the Terps have the opportunity to knock off the kingpin of the Big Ten and the second-ranked team in the country on Friday night. The Hoosiers will undoubtedly aim to prove why they’re deserving of their unblemished 8-0-0 conference record; however, Maryland is a different, more nuanced team heading into the match.</p>\n<p>Led primarily by senior midfielder Amar Sejdic, Maryland boasts a balanced attacking core featuring junior forward/midfielder Paul Bin alongside Sejdic. Sejdic in his senior year has started all 19 games for the Terps and leads the team with six goals off of 54 shots.</p>\n<p>Despite the hefty amount of misses implied in the midfielder’s shooting statistics, it’s clear Sejdic is comfortable taking the lead and will undoubtedly be looked for on the offensive side of things Friday night.</p>\n<p>While clearly a prominent part of Maryland’s offensive gameplan, Sejdic remains without a goal in this year’s two games against Indiana. Likely drawing ample and deserved attention from the Hoosiers on Friday, Sejdic will perhaps open up chances for teammates like Bin to exploit.</p>\n<p>In October’s loss to Indiana, Bin scored the lone goal for Maryland, so he will look to find the back of the net again. With four goals and two assists, Bin sits behind Sejdic in scoring but ranks second on the team in efficiency. In contrast to Sejdic’s 54 shots, Bin has tallied only 26.</p>\n<p>While Sejdic and Bin have been responsible for 12 of Maryland’s goals this season, the Terps’ roster holds three other players who have scored at least two goals on the year. This balanced scoring potential, as well as experience, might be expected at this stage of the postseason, but it provides Maryland the luxury to trust their offensive sets and find the net organically rather than play hero ball.</p>\n<p>Heading into Friday’s game against Indiana, Maryland has the opportunity to knock out a Hoosier team responsible for two winless matches, but the Terps are playing for much more than revenge. Despite the tantalizing element of revenge, Maryland looks for a more rewarding outcome of playing for the College Cup Championship.</p>\n<p>With revenge as well as championship aspirations on the line, the Terrapins will face Indiana at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85320\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85320\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/","id":1330,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1329,1328,1327],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":22,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
