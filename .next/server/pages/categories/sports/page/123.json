Topping the league is Cal State Northridge with a 9-3 overall record.</p>\n<p>This season follows the team’s 2013 Big West Championship title, which it shared with CSUN and Hawaii. The 2014 Coaches Poll placed UCSB at third while first-ranked Hawaii currently comes in at second as the Big West season gets underway.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara has gotten off to a rocky start, repeating is not impossible. The Gauchos proved this from 2002-2004 when they won the Big West Championship in three consecutive seasons.</p>\n<p>“I think our chances are as good as they were last year,” sophomore libero Ali Spindt said. “If we work really hard, I believe that we can [repeat].”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a rough start this year as they began the season on a nine-game road trip, falling in their first four matches of the year to Marquette, Colorado State, Virginia Commonwealth and Loyola Marymount, respectively. However, momentum began to switch for the team as it has won four of its last six matches with three of those being sweeps.</p>\n<p>The team is undefeated at home so far this season, winning both games played in Santa Barbara, and of the 12 games played overall, UCSB has had 1426 total attacks, 665.0 points, and 555 digs, while staying limited to only eight ball-handling errors.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly ended its preseason with a 3-2 loss to Santa Clara in the UCSB/Cal Poly Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We are looking to be really focused in practice this week, so we can go into conference strong,” Spindt said.</p>\n<p>Spindt is currently third among the Big West digs per set leaders, with an average of 4.33 digs per set. For her defensive efforts in two games last week, she was named Big West Defensive Player of the Week. In addition, sophomore middle blocker Phoebe Grunt placed fifth in the league for hitting percentage, with a .346 average. UCSB also ranks fourth overall in total blocks so far this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take the court this Saturday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of September 25, 2014th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Spearheading UCSB’s attack will be Jome, the player who currently leads the team with four total points (one goal, two assists). The young standout has lived up to early season expectations after being the only Gaucho named to the Big West Men’s Preseason All-Conference Team.</p>\n<p>While it hasn’t been a perfect start to the season for Santa Barbara, their only two losses did come against a pair of top 25 ranked teams in No. 19 Furman and No. 23 Stanford. With a relatively younger squad, the Gauchos are looking forward to what will be their biggest test before the beginning of conference play just two weeks from now.</p>\n<p>“We are a young team, and those were two hard tests which we obviously lost, but we’ve just grown as a team because of those tough losses,” Jome said. “The more games we get under our belt before conference the better. UCLA will be a big indicator of where we are right now, so we’re looking forward to that.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB is going to be able to come away with a favorable result this weekend, they will have to find a way to contain UCLA midfielder Leo Stolz. The senior leads his team with two goals and six shots on goal through six games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also be looking to keep possession numbers as even as possible, as the Bruins have shown that they are one of the best in the nation at holding the ball so far this season.</p>\n<p>“The key to the game is pressuring UCLA up the field and dispossessing them in their own half, and getting looks off that,” Jome said. “We need to be disciplined in our own half and not make mistakes like we did against Stanford and Furman which cost us cheap goals.”</p>\n<p>UCSB brings to the match a very balanced offensive attack which has seen a total of eight goals scored by eight different players through its first five games. </p>\n<p>After going winless in three straight games, the Gauchos pulled off a 4-1 win over Colgate last weekend, a match which saw midfielder Drew Murphy score his first goal of the season. The sophomore will be another important player to watch going against a stingy Bruin defense that has allowed an average of just .667 goals per game to opponents this season.</p>\n<p>“We knew we had to make a big statement against Colgate and we did that getting a 4-1 result. It just pushes our momentum forward going against UCLA,” Jome said. “I think we’ve made great strides to get where we need to be as far as just communicating on the field, knowing where we need to be, and being more disciplined as a team.”</p>\n<p>Defensive struggles have plagued UCSB early in the season, as it has allowed an average of two goals per game to opponents.

We knew they were gonna be tough,” Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We did what we had to. We maintained a somewhat comfortable lead and we didn’t let them come back all the way to tie it. If they had, then it could have got dicey. It was a great team effort.”</p>\n<p>​The Gauchos took a 6-3 lead after a goal from junior attacker Ryan Baliani, two from freshman attacker Josh Jordan, one from junior attacker Matthew Hamilton, and two from freshman attacker Shane Hauschild. The Tritons battled back to score two goals in order to enter half time only down by one.</p>\n<p>​UCSB made it a point to work hard against UCSD’s star player senior utility Josh Stiling. With a strong defensive presence, the Gauchos kept Stiling to three goals while making the Tritons focus their attacking plans through other players. With his goals, Stiling was able to keep the score close however.</p>\n<p>​After UCSD’s senior utility Luca De Vivo tied the game at 6-6, the Gauchos went on a run of their own. Baliani, Hamilton, and junior attacker Kevin Cappon scored to give the Gauchos a three-goal lead. From there, the Tritons never caught up as UCSB entered the fourth quarter up 9-7 and added to the lead to make the score 11-7 with goals from junior two-meter Nicholas Jordan and Baliani, his third of the match to give him a hat-trick.</p>\n<p>​A second goal from Cappon extended the Gauchos’ lead before the Tritons scored three goals to trim the lead to two. Junior utility Chase Racich sealed the game for UCSB with a goal with 13 seconds left in the game.</p>\n<p>​“It was a great first game back for us. Huge fan support, school’s not even in session yet and our stands were full. A lot of energy… It was our first home game and a fun way to start the season,” Hamilton said. “Legs [Whitelegge] is the rock of our defense. It’s really easy to play water polo when you have him playing behind you. We just try to make it as easy on him as possible. We just try to do our jobs and let him take care of the rest.”</p>\n<p>​The Gauchos will now look towards the Nor Cal Tournament and their matchup with LMU this upcoming weekend before going to USC to take on the Trojans on Oct. 4.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB’s students have helped make their soccer team No. 1 in the nation in college soccer attendance for the past six years running.</p>\n<p>This year with the departure of five starters and a large number of new recruits, UCSB will have a new look to it. Sophomore Ismaila Jome leads the Gauchos from the midfield as their most exciting young prospect, being the only player on the team voted to the Big West Men’s Preseason All-Conference Team as well as being named to the Preseason All-American Third Team by College Soccer News.</p>\n<p>Defensively, stellar goalkeeper Josh McNeely will be UCSB’s last line of defense just outside the net. The sophomore is coming off of a brilliant freshman year in which he set numerous freshman program records, including lowest goals against average with 0.83 goals allowed per game and minutes played with 1,836. His performances earned him the title of Big West Preseason Defensive Player of the Year as voted by College Sports Madness.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s first game of the preseason against Westmont, the Gauchos dominated on their way to a 2-0 victory. Senior forward Reed McKenna looks primed to be an offensive leader this season already having tied his offensive production from last year with a goal and an assist in this year’s opener.</p>\n<p>Goals might be hard to come by for a relatively inexperienced squad, especially after the departure of the team’s top two goalscorers in Goffin Boyoko and Achille Campion. However, the 15-goal total that those departing players left behind might open the door for new players to showcase their talent.</p>\n<p>“We’re replacing [last year’s starters] with one of the best freshmen classes we’ve had in a long time,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The key is for us to incorporate our young players and have the starting sophomores step up and show their improvement. If we can get goals from new players, work on our defense and get on the same page, then by the end of the year we will be a very good team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will be playing at home during move-in weekend against San Diego State on Sept. 26 and Drake University on Sept. 28. The Gauchos’ quest for another Big West Conference title begins Oct. 2 at Harder Stadium against Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Walthal, in addition to existing assistant coach Kolby O’Donnell.</p>\n<p>Placing first in the Big West last season counts six titles for the team and 28 total appearances in the NCAA tournament for UCSB. Returning starters for the Gauchos this year include outside hitters sophomore Ali Spindt and junior Ali Barbeau, as well as sophomore middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg.</p>\n<p>Last season, both Spindt and Barbeau made the All-Big West First Team, and Grunt was named an All-Big West Honorable Mention. Spindt was also named Big West Freshman of the Year. In addition, Grunt placed first in blocks in the Big West with an average of 1.28 blocks per set, followed by Sullberg who placed fourth with an average of 1.14 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>Losing Sully will be a hit to the team’s strength and versatility as her true position as an outside hitter was sidelined to fill the role as the team’s starting libero. Searching to fill the gap left by Sully, UCSB has recruited three liberos: freshmen Sydney Bast, Kelly Bielaski and Jane Lamp.</p>\n<p>Other incoming freshmen this year are outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, middle blocker/opposite Megan Sullivan and setter/outside hitter Noa Nightingale.</p>\n<p>The four remaining seniors on this year’s squad are setter Ali Santi, libero Keely Stevenson, outside hitter Jordan Pehanick and middle blocker Elizabeth Meddaugh. Last year Santi ranked second on the team in sets with 399 overall.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the team, redshirt junior setter Hanna Nielson is returning this season after ranking seventh in the Big West and first on the team in assists with 719 overall, and an average of 6.6 assists per set. Junior opposite Jaylen Villanueva will also be returning this season after reaching a career-high of 102 kills last season.</p>\n<p>In the Big West Preseason poll, the Gauchos came in behind Hawai’i and Long Beach State and one spot ahead of long time powerhouse Cal State Northridge. The first Big West conference game for the Gauchos will be at home in the Thunderdome against rival Cal Poly on Saturday, Sept. 27. at 7:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The senior’s initial one-time shot was saved by Westmont’s junior goalkeeper Josh Glover, but the rebound fell right back to McKenna who scored an easy goal after regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>UCSB proceeded to dominate possession for the rest of the first half with the Warriors continually attempting to catch the Gauchos on the break with unsuccessful long balls. Jome and McKenna were the best players on the field as they continued to put pressure on the Westmont back four, sending in dangerous crosses on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>After Jome won a corner in the 25th minute, McKenna put in a cross from the left corner flag that found a sky-high Murphy placing a header perfectly into the bottom right corner of the net. The goal gave UCSB a 2-0 lead that would remain intact until the final whistle, but the chances were not done.</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story from the Westmont perspective, as the Warriors tried to capitalize on several sloppy clearances and turnovers in play by UCSB defenders. However, sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely luckily didn’t need to record a single save on the night to preserve the shut out with Westmont attackers consistently missing the target on open looks.</p>\n<p>“I think [the second half] was good. The game opened up and we had a ton of opportunities,” McKenna said. “It could’ve turned into 3, 4, or 5 but you’re not always gonna score all your chances. I thought it was good that we were getting chances and it showed that we have a lot of firepower going forward.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos found themselves with more than one great chance to score, most notably on a breakaway in the 72nd minute when sophomore forward Armand Bagramyan had his one-on-one shot saved by the keeper. Bagramyan had a team-high five shots, as many as the entire Westmont team, as he led a bench mob that played for much of the second half.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re pretty far along,” McKenna said. “Obviously we have a group of 9 players coming in so it will take some time for them to get used to the college atmosphere and game but I think we’re ready to go down to South Carolina and perform well and win games.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend will see UCSB travel to South Carolina to play the College of Charleston at 4:30 p.m. on Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/","id":1173,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1172,1171,1170],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Regular Season Against Cleveland St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The 2014 campaign for the UCSB women's soccer team begins tonight at home.

Our players must keep their minds nimble and we will play to our strengths.”</p>\n<p>On paper, the 2013 statistics for the Gauchos and Cleveland State are relatively even. Both teams shot a total of 26 goals on the season and averaged around one goal per game. However, there are a couple key differences that look to provide the Gauchos with an edge.</p>\n<p>While Cleveland State shot a higher shot percentage, .129 to .109, respectively, the Gauchos averaged nearly one more shot per game and took 22 more shots than Cleveland State last season. These additional opportunities could prove crucial to earning that coveted opening win.</p>\n<p>The biggest statistical difference however, lies in goals allowed average. In the 2013 season, Cleveland State had a GAA of 1.22 while the Gauchos posted a GAA of only 0.87. This large difference is testament to the Gaucho’s strong defense and the stellar play of junior goalkeeper Beth Ritter who tallied a total of eight shutouts last season.</p>\n<p>“This season, we are just hoping to be more consistent.” Ritter said. “We are all super fit and ready to go.”</p>\n<p>Joining Ritter in the starting lineup are fellow preseason honorees senior midfield/forward Indiana Mead and senior midfield/forward Madison Beckley. Mead and Beckley combined for seven goals, five assists and a total of 19 points.</p>\n<p>“We want to play hard and win,” Mead said. “We have had a complete shift from last season and this year, we have been vocal that our main goal is winning.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos must be weary of top opposing strikers junior Vickie Havas and senior Amanda Sivic. Havas led the team with seven goals and four assists, while Sivic was close behind with five goals and four assists.</p>\n<p>The match is set to kick off tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55976\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55976\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/","id":1573,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1572,1571,1570],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Season Against Westmont","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mens-Soccer-Vertical-Right-Facing-15.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mens-Soccer-Vertical-Right-Facing-15.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to start the year strong coming off a very successful 2013 campaign.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a year in which the UCSB men’s soccer team went undefeated in conference play, the Gauchos are set to kickoff the new season as they host Westmont in their annual exhibition game tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“The key for us is going to be the fact that we need to build on what we did last year with five seniors gone,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’ll be a bit of a slow process at the start and then hopefully we’ll get going.”</p>\n<p>With a 12-­6­-3 record last season and an impressive 7­-0­-3 mark in conference play, UCSB earned a No. 10 national seed in the NCAA Tournament.

Two of the more notable departures from the team, forwards Achille Campion and Goffin Boyoko, scored 15 out of the team’s 31 total goals on the year.</p>\n<p>“The key for us is our ability to get our players on the same page and of course we have to find goals from new players,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can get goals from new players, work on our defense, and get on the same page, then by the end of the year we will be a very good team.”</p>\n<p>Despite this loss in offensive production, a strong recruiting class has the team excited about its potential this year.</p>\n<p>“We’re replacing [last year’s starters] with one of the best freshmen classes we’ve had in a long time,” Vom Steeg said. “The key is for us to incorporate our young players and have the starting sophomores step up and show their improvement.”</p>\n<p>Out of the seven sophomores on the team, none perhaps will be more exciting to watch than Ismaila Jome.

Ritter played in 16 games during the 2013 season, allowing only 12 goals and saving an impressive 82.6 percent of shots.</p>\n<p>“We expect a solid defensive performance with a shutout this game,” Ritter said. “We are really excited to build upon what we did last year.”</p>\n<p>With such impressive goalkeeping, UCSB will look to their offense to play a huge factor in adding wins. Senior Madison Beckley will be a crucial offensive weapon as she tied for the team lead in goals last season with five. Junior Angelisa Cortez and sophomore Morgan Idso will also look to make a big impact as they recorded a combined 5 goals and two assists in 2013.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ offense will have to be ready to take full advantage as Westmont comes into this exhibition with a relatively inexperienced goalkeeper in junior Lauren Dorr. Dorr faced a total of only seven shots last year and has only started one game in her Westmont career.</p>\n<p>However, this match won’t be anything to take lightly as Westmont possesses a trio of returning strikers that combined for a total of 18 goals and seven assists last season. Junior forward Kelsey Steck led the team with eight goals and one assist in the 2013 season as Westmont managed to outscore their opponents by a tally of 51 to 13.</p>\n<p>Following the loss of three top defenders after the 2013 season, the Gauchos will look to their younger players to step up and stop this high-powered Westmont offense. Leading the defensive core will be senior center back Miranda Cornejo who started 13 games last season.</p>\n<p>“A big change this year is that we have a deep bench with the addition of 10 new freshman,” Ritter said. “This will be key to winning more games because if somebody gets hurt then our bench will be able to step up.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition is set to kick off tomorrow at Harder Stadium at 7 P.M.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55974\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55974\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/","id":1574,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1573,1572,1571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Offseason: Where Will LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony End Up?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony opting out of their contracts, questions arise as to where the two stars will end up. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There is no doubt at all that these next couple of months will belong to LeBron James. As of yesterday, the King decided to opt out of his contract with the Miami Heat and test the market of free agency, and everyone will follow the crown. This two-time champion and four-time MVP is certainly the player that any team would love to land in hopes of bringing the Larry O’Brien Trophy to their town.</p>\n<p>Although James has opted out, this does not mean he will be leaving the Miami Heat. James could easily re-sign with the Heat but of course with a new, higher salary. Surely, the King is worth the money, but it would be a complicated situation in trying to afford all of the All-Stars that grace the Miami franchise. James will keep an eye on the moves that the Heat makes in the offseason to make his final decision, but he will also welcome offers from other squads in the end. In this current time, James has two main options: stay or return.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been blessed by James, taking his talents to South Beach. Since “The Decision,” the Cavs have been given three number-one picks in the draft and other top-five picks as well in just a few years. If they were to start the player that they draft this year, they would have five young athletes with a lot of potential, but no real leader.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Cavs have a lot of power with their pick this year and the players they have taken before, and they can use this to an extreme advantage. If they were to deal out some player and make cap room, they could ultimately bring James back to his first throne in Ohio.</p>\n<p>The King has wanted to bring a championship back to the homeland since he was drafted and now he has a second shot. With point guard Kyrie Irving and the rights to this year’s No. 1 draft pick, we would surely see an exciting Cavs team to watch and James’s legacy would truly be complete.</p>\n<p>The choice that would be better than James going back home would be to stay in Miami. He just opted out of playing for a team that has been to four straight NBA Finals, in which his team won half. Yes, the fact that he lost two does taint his reputation, but he’s still LeBron James.</p>\n<p>A team going to four straight championship rounds has been unheard of since the Magic and Bird era, and this band of stars pulled it off. Miami is truly the place where James has the greatest chance of success. If the old gang stays together, they have a chance at winning a couple more rings, but not five… or six… or seven.</p>\n<p>Aside from James, another star has hit the market as well. New York Knicks small forward Carmelo Anthony will possibly look for a new arena to play in this upcoming season.</p>\n<p>They say that it is hard to get superstars to play well together for an entire season and the Knicks were a perfect example of this. With former player Derek Fisher coming in as coach, I can’t see a title coming anytime soon and neither could Melo. Now in pursuit of a ring, and not a wad of cash, he has two very valuable options to look at.</p>\n<p>First is the one that people have been buzzing about since the season ended: Chicago. This team has continued to be consistent and a dominant defensive powerhouse throughout the last couple of seasons. Even with former MVP Derrick Rose sitting out nearly two full seasons and Luol Deng moving to Cleveland, the Bulls have still been a name in the Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>The team’s defensive play has been enough to carry them to victories without Rose, but their offense has struggled to the point where D.J. Augustin became their first scoring option. In comes Melo and this is a completely different offense.</p>\n<p>Rose’s success and effectiveness is unclear with this franchise at this point, and Anthony is someone that they can rely on to take the shots. If Rose were to return and possibly accept a role as a facilitator, he could use his slashing skills to his and Melo’s advantage while still getting his own buckets.</p>\n<p>Another possible home for Carmelo would be Houston. He would join a band of strong offensive players and an already well-suited program that just lacks a bit of direction. The Rockets have all of the tools they need in James Harden up top, Dwight Howard down low and a now-proven Chandler Parsons supporting them.</p>\n<p>Adding Melo into the mix could be dangerous, going back to making stars play well together, but the Heat was able to do it twice and these guys would have the same level of talent with Anthony on their squad.</p>\n<p>This could be the more likely spot due to Chicago’s latest move. The word surrounding the Bulls now is the hot trade option in Minnesota Timberwolf, Kevin Love. To acquire the double-double machine, the Bulls have been said to give away possibly Taj Gibson, Tony Snell and both of their first round picks.</p>\n<p>They are certainly on top of Minnesota’s K-Love option, along with the Warriors who could be looking to dish Klay Thompson. There are plenty more agents to keep an eye on this season and, with a fantastic draft class coming in, this will surely be an exciting off-season.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in June 24, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55856\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55856\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/","id":2026,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[2025,2024,2023],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brazil’s Neymar Relishing the Pressure","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The fate of the Brazilian national soccer team lies on the foot of 22-year-old Neymar.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the weight of an entire nation on his shoulders, Brazilian Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior has delivered for the host nation in the World Cup. All eyes were on him entering the biggest event in sports, and Neymar has delivered. At only 22 years old, the forward has carried the team into the round of 16 and is the current leader in goals scored in the tournament with a total of four.</p>\n<p>In Monday’s match against Cameroon, Neymar snuck past the defense and scored in the 17th minute, converting on a beautifully delivered cross in the middle of the box. It was not an easy finish, but a player of his quality, Neymar knew exactly where to slot the ball past the goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>His second goal against the Cameroonians showed how lethal he can be. Neymar ran straight into the heart of the defense and shot with his right foot, putting the ball in the back of the net on a goal near post. To put into perspective how important Neymar has been to this Brazilian side, Brazil has scored seven goals in the tournament and four of them have come off the boot of Neymar. Without him, things may not be going so well for the Seleção in the group stage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>His goals gave his side first place in Group A as Brazil now prepares to play South American foe Chile in the knockout stages. But the tournament means a lot more for the country of Brazil than just soccer. Soccer has been Brazil’s way of proving itself to the rest of the world, giving more pressure for this team to win the World Cup.</p>\n<p>With protests surrounding the event before it even began because of stadium workers demanding better working conditions, and controversy as to whether the billions of dollars invested into the World Cup should be spent on helping relieve poverty in the country, perhaps no other team has needed to win so much upon entering the tournament.</p>\n<p>For Brazilians, this World Cup’s success is contingent on how well the national team performs, and anything less than a championship would bring down the hopes of an entire country. As the Brazilian national team goes, so do the people of Brazil.</p>\n<p>That makes what Neymar has done even more impressive. In his first season playing with European soccer giant F.C. Barcelona, the forward had nine goals in 26 appearances for the club. However, it is when he puts on the yellow jersey that his similarities to Argentina’s Lionel Messi or Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo are really seen. With 35 goals scored in 52 appearances, he already ranks sixth for most goals scored for Brazil, ahead of other legendary Brazilian players such as Ronaldinho de Assis Moreira and Romário de Souza Faria.</p>\n<p>In last year’s Confederations Cup, he was elected as the tournament’s best player and scored four goals in five games. It was a preview to what we are seeing now. Clearly, Neymar has a knack to deliver when his country needs him the most.</p>\n<p>Although he is only 22 years old, he shows the maturity of a savvy veteran when he steps onto the pitch. His acceleration and pace allow him to separate from defenders, but his dribbling and creativity on the ball is what puts him in such an elite category. He is a master with the ball and has the potential to be the greatest player in the world. He shines most when the pressure is on.</p>\n<p>Although Brazil easily dispatched opponents Croatia and Cameroon, it was a shaky performance from the team as a whole. The team’s backline at times looked flustered and it could prove costly from now on. Brazil’s defenders have a tendency of pushing too much into the attack, leaving holes for opponents to exploit.</p>\n<p>That could be a problem against Chile, who has players such as Arturo Vidal who is deadly in open space. Aside from that, Chile is  firing from all cylinders, as demonstrated when they eliminated defending champions Spain.</p>\n<p>So can an entire team win the World Cup behind only one player? In the 1986 World Cup, Argentina lifted the trophy on the sole efforts of Diego Maradona, arguably the best soccer player of all time. Now the same question must be asked of Neymar.  Ultimately, it will need to be a team effort for Brazil to win. However, Brazil will thrive as long as Neymar does.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in June 24, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/","id":2030,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2029,2028,2027],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Klinsmann: Just What Team USA Needs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Head Coach Jurgen Klinsmann has led team USA to the brink of advancing to the round of 16 in the World Cup.

Klinsmann made good decision after good decision as his team went on a historic run of 12 straight wins, the seventh-longest winning streak in the history of international soccer and the longest in the world at the time.  The streak included wins over No. 2 Germany, a near-perfect showing in the Gold Cup and a 2-0 comeback against Bosnia-Herzegovina on the road.</p>\n<p>The win-streak established Klinsmann as the right man to lead team USA into the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but his leadership was once against questioned when he cut Donovan from the World Cup roster.</p>\n<p>For thousands of fans, including myself, this move was difficult to understand and even harder to swallow. Not only does Donovan have the most goals and assists in the U.S. men’s national team’s history, but he was widely believed to still be the team’s best player at the age of 32. He won the Golden Ball in the Gold Cup, awarded to the tournament’s best player, and was valuable as an experienced leader having already played in three World Cups. This didn’t matter to Klinsmann, though, who claimed that the United States loves to reward its players for what they have done rather than rewarding them for how good they are now.</p>\n<p>Soon after, in what was apparently an attempt to motivate his team, Klinsmann claimed that there was not a “realistic chance” for Team USA to win the World Cup. The team had already been placed in this year’s “Group of Death,” put up against No. 2 Germany, No. 4 Portugal and its World Cup nemesis, Ghana.</p>\n<p>If these moves leading up to Brazil proved to be the wrong ones, Klinsmann would be the one to blame for a wasted World Cup.</p>\n<p>Now, with two games already having been played in Brazil, people all around the world are shocked once more by the brilliant decisions that Klinsmann has made.</p>\n<p>Forward Clint Dempsey got the United States off to an incredible start in its first match against Ghana by scoring a goal in the first minute of the game. Alejandro Bedoya performed well as he filled Donovan’s shoes on the right side.</p>\n<p>However, an injury to center back Matt Besler prompted Klinsmann to substitute young defender John Brooks in his place. As the second half began, I had one question going through my mind, the same question thatI’m sure thousands of other Americans had: “Who the hell is John Brooks?”</p>\n<p>In the 86th minute with the game tied at 1-1, the 21-year old German-American scored the game-winning goal off of a corner kick from teammate Graham Zusi. Now every fan who watched that game will remember the name John Brooks for the rest of their lives thanks to the decision by Klinsmann to put him on the pitch.</p>\n<p>More tough choices had to be made in the second group-stage match against Portugal with Altidore still out of the lineup and more injuries happening all over the place. Bedoya did not have the same performance he had in the team’s first match and was soon replaced by 20-year old DeAndre Yedlin.</p>\n<p>This was another questionable move that proved all of Klinsmann’s doubters wrong, as Yedlin came in with an immediate impact. In the 81st minute, he made a run to the end-line that led to Dempsey’s second goal against Portugal and a 2-1 lead for the US.</p>\n<p>A win or draw in its final group-stage match against Germany will have the USA through to the next round, but a loss by multiple goals could have them shockingly eliminated.

\r\n</script> \n<p>However, this season was very different in what was a season of struggle for the Gauchos. Finishing the year at just 8-22 overall and 3-13 in conference play, Santa Barbara barely qualified for the Big West Tournament, losing to UC Davis in the first round.</p>\n<p>In that loss, UCSB’s seniors scored every point in the second-half comeback. Losing its entire starting backcourt to graduation, the Gauchos will miss the majority of its scoring as senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason accounted for 64.3 percent of the team’s offense.</p>\n<p>All three averaged double-digit scoring for Santa Barbara and were the only players to do so. Nesbit and Zornig both hit the 1,000-point career milestone this season and were named All-Big West Honorable Mention selections.</p>\n<p>“They understand that they’re not going to be remembered by their last record. All of them left here better players,” Mitchell said. “All have signed with agents and will have a chance to play in Europe.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Santa Barbara does return seven players. In fact, its two returning starters are at the two positions most difficult to replace. Next season, freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe will return as a sophomore after being named to the Big West All-Freshmen team this season and averaging 5.8 points and 2.2 assists while running the show for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Playing center, junior Clair Watkins will play her first full season with the Gauchos after joining the team in December this season. Watkins found her stride toward the end of the year, averaging 8.6 points and 8.4 rebounds in the last seven games.</p>\n<p>Along with junior guard Kristine Brance, Watkins will be expected to be the leader of next year’s squad.</p>\n<p>“I think our upperclassmen have had a great postseason and have worked harder than any group in my three years here,” Mitchell said. “Some of that you can talk up to the bitter taste we had in our mouth. Now they realize you have three senior guards leaving and someone has to step up. I’ve told Clair she has the ability to be one of the best post players in the conference. When she’s willing to step up and carry that burden, then we’ll be a big-time team.”</p>\n<p>While Mitchell looks to replace the offense lost from the graduating seniors with this year’s recruits, the focus will return to the defensive end. This season, the Gauchos scored more points than any team during Mitchell’s reign, but also gave up the most points of any of her past teams.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to go back to being that really mean, tough, defensive team,” Mitchell said. “I think a combination of us trying to prove we could score 70 points a game this season … somehow we didn’t have the mindset or mentality to put away close games. So you know a lot of that will be put on my shoulders to make sure out team knows what our identity will look like, but I don’t think it will be hard to convince them after our record this year.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, in recruiting, Mitchell looked for versatile players while looking to add height to the roster.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for versatility and more of a physical presence body-wise. At the end of the day, most of the time it was on the defensive end we had a hard time matching up with people because of our lack of size,” Mitchell said. “At the championship level or when you get to March, it’s about grinding it out in the half court, both offensively and defensively. All play for great programs and they know what it takes to win. That’s, to me, the biggest thing.”</p>\n<p>This year’s recruiting class includes guard Dioseline Lopez, guard/forward Chaya Durr, guard Makala Roper, guard Taylor Farris and forward/center Sabrina Callahan.</p>\n<p><strong>Dioseline Lopez</strong></p>\n<p>Mitchell’s newest recruit, Lopez, is a 5’6” guard transferring from East Los Angeles College. Averaging 14.3 points per game and leading the South Coast Conference in assists, rebounds and steals with 7.4, 4.3 and 2.3 per game, respectively, Lopez was named SCC North Division Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Lopez was also named to the All-SCC North First Team for the second time and the California Community College Athletic Association All-State Third Team.</p>\n<p>“It only took me watching film on Dee to see that swag she has. She was able to play with our kids, and right away they were begging us to take her,” Mitchell said. “She’s a true point guard, but like Nic, has the ability to score a lot. I think [she] will relieve some of the pressure from Onome thinking that she has to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>Lopez brings more depth to the point guard position, but can also serve as a scoring threat for UCSB. Leading her team to the second round of the CCCAA Southern California playoffs, she scored 33 points and six assists in a tight 92-88 overtime loss.</p>\n<p>“She’ll run the show, she’ll facilitate, but if we need her to score, she has that ability,” Mitchell said. “She has toughness. She hasn’t had the easiest path to get here, and that’s okay with me because she has that fire to prove to everyone she can play at this level.”</p>\n<p><strong>Chaya Durr</strong></p>\n<p>Durr missed her senior season at Sacramento High School with an ACL tear, but should be 100 percent ready to go in August or September. She will join teammate Jasmine Ware as the second Sac High Lady Dragon on the Gaucho roster.</p>\n<p>“I have no problem saying it: We would’ve never signed her if she hadn’t have torn her ACL,” Mitchell said. “But I’m not worried about her missing her senior year of high school. We know what she’s capable of.”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard or forward position and listed at 5’11”, Durr averaged a double-double during her junior year with 18 points and 12 rebounds per contest. She also tallied 4.0 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. As a result, Durr was named all-city and an all-league first team member.</p>\n<p>“She’s a big-time athlete, very passionate and can make a huge difference on the [boards],” Mitchell said. “Defensively, she’s one of those that, if we want to press — and if you saw the team our last game of the year against Davis, that’s the style that will fit Chaya and help us have more of an up-tempo look.”</p>\n<p><strong>Makala Roper</strong></p>\n<p>A combination guard from Cleveland High School in Seattle, 5’8” Roper earned 3A Player of the Year honors this year after helping her team win the Class 3A State Girls Basketball title as both a junior and senior. Roper was honored with the MVP trophy of the Class 3A All-Tournament Team as well.</p>\n<p>“She’s a lefty and a deadly shooter,” Mitchell said. “She could play a little bit of point because she has great handles and even though she puts up big numbers and has the reputation of being a scorer, we know she’s a great passer and facilitator.”</p>\n<p>Leading her team to an undefeated 16-0 conference record, the player her teammates call “Sniper” averaged 16.3 points per game her senior year. In addition, according to MaxPreps, Roper is the top-ranked player in Washington.</p>\n<p>“She’ll be able to play the scoring position,” Mitchell said. “Losing Mel Zornig, she should give us that three-point shooter that we have graduating.”</p>\n<p><strong>Taylor Farris</strong></p>\n<p>Farris joins the Gauchos from Renton, Washington. Listed at 5’11”, Farris was named the League MVP as a junior. The same year, she led Renton High to third place, its best finish in the 2A State Tournament since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Taylor Farris is a long athlete,” Mitchell said. “She’s better around the basket and the rim. She works well in tight quarters and has great timing. ”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard position, Farris averaged 20.9 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 7.3 steals and 4.1 blocks her senior season.</p>\n<p>“She played at a smaller high school, but played for one of the top AAU programs, so we have no question she can come right in with her length — she gets tons of deflections,” Mitchell said. “Her comfort level may be the four right now because she’s great from the high post, but at some point, she shoots it well enough she’ll be able to move out to a perimeter position for us.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sabrina Callahan</strong></p>\n<p>Playing at forward or center at one of the women’s basketball powerhouses in Southern California, La Jolla Country Day School, Callahan averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.9 blocks per game. At 6’0”, she also shot 51 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“From day one, I told my staff I wanted a kid that played for Terri Bamford. She’s that good and that respected at La Jolla Country Day,” Mitchell said. “Her kids typically play with her all through their AAU program also, so they’re well-coached and understand the skills.”</p>\n<p>This season, Callahan earned All-San Diego Section second team honors.</p>\n<p>“Sabrina understands all the little things it takes to win, whether it’s screening, being a great passer, and a lot of times she’s the one out there directing traffic on the floor from the four position,” Mitchell said. “She gives us size, she gives us versatility and at some point she’ll move over to the wing position as well.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will begin its season in November. Included on the schedule will be LSU, which was a Sweet 16 team in the NCAA Tournament last season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of June 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/","id":509,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[508,507,506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From NorCal to SoCal: Returning  to Playoff-Caliber Teams","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lakers’ Success Still Relies on Kobe Bryant","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After the worst season in franchise history, the Los Angeles Lakers have plenty of areas they need to address in the upcoming offseason. While the cupboard is not completely empty, it might be a couple years before the Lakers are back atop the NBA and ready to compete for a championship. Despite the uncertainties facing the team, the Lakers have always shown an ability and willingness to make drastic moves to improve overnight.</p>\n<p>Before making any serious roster decisions, the owners and general manager Mitch Kupchak need to hire the right coach for the team. Thankfully, Mike D’Antoni will not be returning next season. Several people have been rumored as potential fits for the Lakers, including Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott, Mike Dunleavy, Lionel Hollins and Alvin Gentry, among others. Personally, among the names listed, Scott or Hollins make the most sense to me, but that decision will be up to the front office to figure out.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Lakers’ player personnel, it all starts with Kobe Bryant. The future Hall-of-Famer will enter his 18th season with serious questions regarding his ability to play at the same elite level after missing most of last season with injuries to his knee and Achilles. The Lakers made an enormous gesture toward Kobe in awarding him the largest salary in the league, but this big number limits the team in many ways.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Only three players have guaranteed contracts for next season, including Kobe, Steve Nash and Robert Sacre. Nash is the oldest player in the league and missed most of last season with nerve and back injuries. He is a shell of his former self, but may still prove to be an effective distributor if he can stay on the court. Kendall Marshall’s non-guaranteed contract of under $1 million is a good bargain for a player that is still young and possesses a lot of potential.</p>\n<p>Despite Nash and Marshall’s probable inclusion on the roster, point guard will be a major area of emphasis for the Lakers this offseason. The Lakers hold the No. 7 pick in this year’s draft. While top point guard prospect Dante Exum will likely be off the board by then, the Lakers could opt to select Oklahoma State’s Marcus Smart if he is still available. Smart would give the Lakers an aggressive and talented athlete, albeit it one with some past character concerns to speak of. Possible free agent fits include Eric Bledsoe and Darren Collison, although the Phoenix Suns are likely to match any offer made to Bledsoe.</p>\n<p>With Pau Gasol unlikely to return, as he might command too large of a contract in free agency for the Lakers to re-sign him, the team is in need of a talented big man. Some names that could be available to the Lakers in this year’s draft include Kentucky’s Julius Randle, Indiana’s Noah Vonleh or Arizona’s Aaron Gordon. Each would add a presence down low for the Lakers and ooze with potential, although in different aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>There is a limited pool of free agent players this year and the Lakers do not seem like a great fit for the top player on the board, Carmelo Anthony. Los Angeles may be best suited to re-sign the likes of Nick Young and Jodie Meeks, add one or two B-list players and wait until the loaded free agent pool of next season.</p>\n<p>It seems unlikely the Lakers will acquire Kevin Love through a trade, as they do not have the resources others can offer to the Timberwolves. The Lakers can try to add Love, LaMarcus Aldridge or Rajon Rondo next offseason in an attempt to reload and ascend to the top of the NBA.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of May 28th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Minchen Shen of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55646\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55646\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/","id":2069,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[2068,2067,2066],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Sports Editors Say Their Goodbyes: Paul-Michael Ochoa","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kristen and Paul-Michael Dish on UCSB, Isla Vista and Their Time as Sports Editors  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Four years at UCSB flew by.</p>\n<p>My two years as Sports Editor at the Daily Nexus went by just as quickly.

Any one of us, or our friends, could have been a victim on Friday night.</p>\n<p>Surround yourself with people you care about, and likewise care about you. Meet people who challenge and inspire you to improve upon yourself. Life is too short for anything less.</p>\n<p>This year has been a rough one for many at UCSB. Numerous stories and media coverages have engulfed our campus throughout the year, especially in the last week.</p>\n<p>However, despite all this, the resiliency and determination that comes with being a Gaucho has shined.</p>\n<p>The community’s responses and discussions regarding events this year makes me supremely proud to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>We care about our community and each other and I will miss the friendly faces on the streets of I.V. I have grown to love.</p>\n<p>Much of my love for UCSB comes from my time and experiences at the Nexus and with Gaucho athletics.</p>\n<p>I was lucky enough to cover the men’s basketball team for two seasons and met some extremely talented, humble and kind people in the process. Big Al, you are a beast and I hope to watch you in the NBA for years to come. Punish the Big West next year and bring the Gauchos back to the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>For all you Gauchos out there, please support our teams for the remainder of your college career. We have up-and-coming baseball, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams that I have had the privilege of covering during my tenure with the Nexus. Grab a few friends and head out to a game sometime; I promise you won’t regret it.</p>\n<p>I personally want to thank everyone at the Nexus for all the hard work and collaboration over the past four years. I also want to especially thank my co-editor Kristen for working with me these past two years. There’s no way I would have made it through all those late nights without the help and collaboration. We definitely made a great team and brought our own unique talents and preferences to the paper.</p>\n<p>Thank you to my brothers and sisters in Alpha Kappa Psi. You made college for me. You challenged me to improve and changed me for the better, and without all my experiences with you all, I would not be ready to enter the real world in a short few weeks.</p>\n<p>Lastly, thank you to all my fellow Gauchos for making these past four years the best of my life. Whether it was celebrating a Gaucho victory over Cal Poly or partying on Deltopia in the respectful way we know how, we had fun and we did it with class. It may not appear that way to outsiders, but we know what we stand for.</p>\n<p>Gauchostrong baby,</p>\n<p>Paul-Michael Ochoa</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of May 28th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55651\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55651\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/","id":3256,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3255,3254,3253],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":123,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
