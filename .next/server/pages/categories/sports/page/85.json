Hawaii improved to 18-10 overall, 11-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of Hawaii’s shooting was senior guard/forward Destiny King going 5-6 from the field as she nearly notched a double-double with 13 points and a game-high nine rebounds. She also managed to tally three steals in the team’s Senior Night matchup while junior point guard Briana Harris led all scorers with 15 points.</p>\n<p>Although freshman guard Coco Miller registered a team-high 13 points, the rest of the Gauchos’ offense struggled as no other player finished in double-figures.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded buckets to begin the game, ending the first quarter tied at 13 apiece. Combining for 12 of Santa Barbara’s 13 points in the period was Miller and senior guard Jasmine Ware with six points each. King managed to keep the Rainbow Wahine in contention with six points in the opening quarter as well.</p>\n<p>Yet, it was free-throw shooting that sustained the steady swap of points between the two teams. UCSB ended the first half 7-10 at the free-throw line while Hawaii made 6-13 attempts, resulting in the Rainbow Wahine’s 26-21 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>While Hawaii managed to get to the free-throw line in the third quarter as well, complementing the Rainbow Wahine’s foul shooting was their 55.6 shooting percentage in the period. With five minutes remaining in the quarter, Hawaii embarked on a 14-2 run to end the third with a 44-31 lead.</p>\n<p>Trailing by double-figures, UCSB trimmed Hawaii’s lead to single-figures at the 2:59 mark of the final period off a pair of free-throws by junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>However, restraining Santa Barbara’s comeback was its cold shooting hand as it recorded its worst field goal percentage of the game in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>In spite of going 9-10 at the free-throw line, the Gauchos shot 2-12 from the field and 1-5 from behind the three-point in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Contrary to UCSB’s shooting struggles, Hawaii’s second half improvements shooting the ball continued. The Rainbow Wahine concluded the final stretch of Thursday’s contest with a 54.5 field goal percentage on 6-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>In addition to recording season-lows in overall and three-point field goal percentage, the Gauchos also tied their season-low total of five assists.</p>\n<p>UCSB will await the outcome of Saturday’s game between Hawaii and Cal Poly in order to know what seeding it will earn in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>With a Cal Poly loss, Santa Barbara could secure the No. 5 seed. If the Mustangs were to win, they would be tied with UCSB at 8-8 in conference play. Since both teams split the pair of games they had against each other, the No. 5 seed would be rewarded to Cal Poly for having a better overall record.</p>\n<p>Currently tied for the No. 2 seed with Long Beach State, Hawaii faces a similar situation. A win over Cal Poly and a loss by the 49ers could help them to secure the seed. However, if neither team loses a game on Saurday, LBSU will be rewarded the No. 2 seed due to it possessing a greater overall record.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Tournament will begin Tuesday, March 8 at 6 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/","id":353,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[352,351,350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Soar in 2nd Half to Defeat UCR 81-55, Host Cal Poly Saturday for Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.11.2014-1175.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.11.2014-1175.jpg?resize=851%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A new record was etched into UCSB men's basketball history as the Gauchos tallied their seventh consecutive Big West victory in a season with their 81-55 victory over UC Riverside Thursday night.

The Highlanders are in a three-way tie for fifth-place between UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara converted on three of its first four possessions, opening the game with a 6-0 run. Riverside Head Coach Dennis Cutts quickly called a timeout, benching his starting lineup for a fresh five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on the Highlander’s second-man rotation, jumping out to a 14-4 lead. Freshman forward Jarriesse Blackmon scored five of his career-high nine points in the first five minutes of the game, taking a pass from guard Gabe Vincent and connecting from three with 17:29 to go.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous [taking the starting job], but I also understand that I have to be ready when my name is called,” said Blackmon. “I was fortunate enough to have it called in the beginning of the game and bring that same type of energy I had starting the season.”</p>\n<p>Blackmon has started three-straight games for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Following a 14-4 run dealt by the Gauchos, Riverside battled its way back. Freshman center Menno Dijkstra made his presence known in the paint. The 7’0” footer tallied in all 10 of his points in the first half going a perfect 5-5 from the floor.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Gentrey Thomas also scored all 10 of his points in the first period including a nifty finger roll which put the score at 35-38 with 1:39 remaining prior to halftime.</p>\n<p>After an even first half, the Gauchos came out with a sense of urgency moving out to a 21-3 run. Michael Bryson took control scoring 11 of his game-high 19 points in the second half. Bryson was 4-4 from the floor in the second, including a go-ahead alley-oop from teammate T.J. Taylor which put the score at 65-45 with 8:39 to play.</p>\n<p>“It was a great pass,” said Bryson. “Watching [T.J.] throw it in the air, I thought it was going to be bad but I was able to go up and get it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had other weapons in support of Bryson’s performance. Seniors Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green all played their part in yesterday’s win scoring 26 of Santa Barbara’s bench points. Gabe Vincent had an effective night as well adding 11 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to match up with us right now because we’re so deep,” Bryson said. “Everybody that comes in is contributing something. It’s a tough road for anyone who meets us in March.”</p>\n<p>Green was the main catalyst off the bench scoring 14 points in 21 minutes as well as hitting a season-high four three pointers. Prior to Thursday’s match, Green came off a season-high 19-point performance in Santa Barbara’s win against Cal State Fullerton Feb. 27.</p>\n<p>“I’ve just been trying to focus on making shots when my opportunity comes, so during the game I can put them up, follow through, and make sure it goes in,” Green said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 29-55 for the game as well as shooting 50 percent, 12-24, from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara’s offense hit its stride, its defensive presence helped to set it apart in the second half. After allowing a 46.7 shooting percentage in the first period, UCSB held the Highlanders to a 21.4 field goal percentage in the second half. They shot 6-28 from the field, including 2-14 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“The difference [in the game] was we were really good defensively in the second half,” Williams said. “Our effort night in and night out has been better. Our activity level has to stay high on the defensive end in order to be where we want to be.”</p>\n<p>Michael Bryson, Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green will play their final home game this Saturday, March 5 as UCSB takes on rival Cal Poly. This stands as an opportunity for the seniors to leave their final imprints in a blue and gold uniform.</p>\n<p>“[This moment] will be bittersweet,” said Green. “Senior night will be a big day for us. I just want to make sure the six seniors including myself build a legacy here and create history for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently on a four-game winning streak against Cal Poly. Tip-off between the Gauchos and Mustangs will be at 4 p.m. in the Thunderdome. An honorary ceremony for the seniors will take place following the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68878\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68878\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/","id":324,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[323,322,321],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Carries Momentum to No. 9 Oregon","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_5-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are looking to upset No. 9 Oregon at its home park.

In particular, sophomore David Peterson has had an amazing start to the season. The left-handed pitcher has a 0.69 ERA thanks to only allowing six hits and one earned run in 13 innings pitched. He also has 14 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Another solid pitcher for the No. 9 team is redshirt junior Cole Irvin, who has also had a solid start to the season, posting a 1.29 ERA in his 14 innings pitched. He has only allowed eight hits and two runs while leading the team in strikeouts with 21.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the mound is UCSB and its offense, which has been on fire as of late. It currently leads the Big West in runs scored with 85; the next closest is Cal Poly with 61.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also leads the conference in batting average as a team, RBI, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, hits, doubles hit and triples hit.</p>\n<p>Leading the offense is sophomore DH Austin Bush. The Big West Field Player of the Week’s performance has been great this past weekend. In his last four games he has batted .667 (10-15) and has accounted for 10 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Bush is first on the team and in the conference in batting average with a .542 BA. The sophomore is also second in the Big West and first on the team in RBIs with 12. However, he isn’t alone in leading the charge. Other solid hitters are senior third baseman Ryan Clark, who is second on the team in batting average with a .467, and redshirt sophomore Josh Adams, who leads the team in home runs with two.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Andrew Calica is also an important member of the team; he has done a great job as the lead-off hitter. He is the most efficient on the team at getting on the base with a .565 on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>The storyline of this series will be which team’s strength will overcome the other. Although the Ducks have a great pitching staff, UCSB will look to change that with the hot offense it has been producing lately. In three of the last four games, it has scored over 10 runs.</p>\n<p>This series will also be important if the Gauchos want to gain more respect in terms of national rankings. Taking a series from the No. 9 team in the country after defeating the No. 21 team handily should be enough to hopefully garner more attention.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next opponent is Oregon in a three-game series which begins Friday, March 4 at PK Park at 6 p.m. Saturday’s game is at 2 p.m., while Sunday’s is at 12 p.m., both at PK Park.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of March 3, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Steph has also already beaten his old NBA record of three-pointers made in a season with 288 with still over a month left in the regular season.</p>\n<p>Based on the amount of three-pointers he’s made through the first 58 games, Curry would finish this season with about 400 three-pointers, about a 40 percent increase over his record-setting performance from last season.</p>\n<p>To shed some perspective to fans outside of the basketball community, that would be as though if the current NFL record of 55 touchdown passes suddenly shot up to 77. Or in baseball, the home run record, which is currently at 77, suddenly shot up to over 100 — 102 to be exact — home runs in a season which would be incredible.</p>\n<p>When thinking of Curry’s season in that light, how could someone not believe that this season has been absolutely amazing?</p>\n<p>Normally, that stat alone would be enough, but it doesn’t even tell half the story because it’s not just the fact that Curry is making threes, it’s about where he is making it from.</p>\n<p>From 28-40 feet, Curry has made 36 three-pointers, tripling the amount of the next player on the list while shooting an astonishing 68 percent.</p>\n<p>To shed more light on how amazing that statistic is, a player would have to be shooting almost 95 percent from inside the three-point line to be as efficient as Curry is from 28-40 feet. The highest shooting percentage someone has ever posted inside the arch is Wilt Chamberlin’s 72 percent.</p>\n<p>Steph has also broken the record for consecutive games with at least one three-pointer made with 128, beating Kyle Korver’s former record of 127. And although Korver is one of the best three-point shooters in the history of the league, his streak was mostly extended by games with one, two or three makes, while more than half of Curry’s games involve at least four triples.</p>\n<p>Now even if we move the conversation to advanced analytics, Curry would still be dominating the attention. This season, Steph’s 32.96 player efficiency rating (P.E.R.), a formula used to rate every player’s statistical performance, would be the best in NBA history if the season ended today.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Curry isn’t exactly playing every minute of the game.</p>\n<p>In fact, most nights when the Warriors are blowing out a team, Curry will sit and miss out on precious minutes that could further enhance his stats.</p>\n<p>Currently, No. 30 for Golden State averages, 33.9 minutes per game, 33rd most in the league, yet he still leads the league in points per game with 30.7 and is tied for first among guards for best field goal percentage with .515.</p>\n<p>Using the advanced analytic per-minute statistics — a formula used to determine the quality of minutes played by a single player — Curry is even more dangerous.</p>\n<p>For points per 48 minutes, the advanced metric determines that Curry would be averaging 43.5 points per game. The next closest on the list would be Demarcus Cousins with 38 PPG, almost a six-point difference.</p>\n<p>Now people will always talk down Curry by bringing up the G.O.A.T., Michael Jordan, which is fair; I mean he is Michael Jordan. However, in this particular case it doesn’t fit the narrative. In terms of just one season, Curry has been lights-out; even better than Jordan.</p>\n<p>For example, Curry’s OBPM, offensive-box plus minus, is currently at 13.2 which is more than Jordan’s record of 9.8. This 3.4-point gap between the two stars is equivalent to Jordan and the 71st-best player on that list.</p>\n<p>There is also no doubt that Curry has been an absolute catalyst for his team. Currently, the Warriors are 54-5 overall — the best start through 59 games in NBA history — and Curry and his deadly shooting have played a big part in that.</p>\n<p>Without Curry, the Warriors wouldn’t have the great chance they have to break the all-time NBA record of best regular season record which is currently at 72-10 by Jordan’s ’96 Chicago Bulls. It would be only fitting that the team with the best record in NBA history would be led by the player who had the best season in NBA history.</p>\n<p>But honestly, stats are nothing compared to witnessing the man in action. If you want to witness history, then turn on your TV and put on a Warriors game; it doesn’t matter who it’s against. Then sit down and watch Curry pull up from ridiculous spots on the court and drain them as announcers and fans look in awe.</p>\n<p>I can give you all the stats in the world, but it’s nothing compared to watching Curry devastate the Thunder and their fans by pulling up from 32 feet and draining the shot as if it was nothing to him.<br>\nSome old-school fans and analysts (and the occasional haters) will try to say that if Curry was in another era, this wouldn’t be happening. To those people I say, “Who cares?” Time is progressive, it goes forward not back, so there is no point in playing hypotheticals.</p>\n<p>All we can do is witness history as it happens, and I guarantee what Curry is doing might not happen again for a long time. The game isn’t what it was in the ’70s, the ’80s, the ’90s or even the 2000s. It has evolved into a different game and the person who is leading that change is Stephen Curry.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying Curry is better than Jordan. I’m not saying he will ever be better than the G.O.A.T. He might, but that’s not my point. My point is that, right now, Curry is having possibly the best season ever, and we should appreciate every moment the baby-faced assassin gives us.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of March 3, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

This weekend will be Santa Barbara’s best opportunity to capitalize since it is the only ranked team amongst its opponents.</p>\n<p>So far the Gauchos have only played one game against an unranked opponent, Cal Baptist, and took home the victory 10-4. Despite the statistics, Coach Kay knows that numbers do not matter at the end of the day, assuring that the team’s “mentality does not change with opponent.”</p>\n<p>The first matchup will be against the University of La Verne, who is 3-0 thus far this season. It was an encouraging 2015 season for the Leopards, who finished with an overall record of 7-14 under first-year Head Coach William Rodriguez. Despite being a year full of changes and adjustments, La Verne managed to surprise everyone by taking fifth-place in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest strengths that La Verne depends on is its depth. With seven returning players and a great recruiting class, the Leopards have players ready to step in when needed or just to keep a fresh group in the water. This helps the team maintain their attack strong, going on unanswered runs right away that make it hard for their opponent to try to come back. So far, two of its three wins have been by a double-figure margin. Most notably, in the Leopards’ season opener, they defeated Grove City College by a score of 24-3.</p>\n<p>Although it is a young team, the Leopards have a roster with talented players such as freshman attacker Guarina Garcia. The Puerto Rico native has scored nine goals in La Verne’s three matches. She is a member of the Puerto Rico senior national team, as well as the junior national team. Garcia won a silver medal at the XXII Central American and Caribbean games and has played in several of the Pan-Am games.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day will be against Claremont Mudd-Scripps, who is 1-5 overall so far this season. Its lone victory came in its opening match against Concordia. The Athenas finished 11-17 overall, 8-3 in conference last year and took third-place at the SCIAC Championships.</p>\n<p>It seems to be that Claremont’s biggest challenge is its defense’s inability to prevent opponents from scoring. Out of its five losses, four of them were by 10 points or more. No. 6 Hawaii and No.21 Long Beach defeated the Athenas 20-3, 20-5 respectively.</p>\n<p>The leading scorer for Claremont is Santa Barbara native, sophomore attacker Jessica Gaffney, who has a total of eight goals in the last five games.

UCSB has beaten all of its opponents by double-figures during its six-game win streak.</p>\n<p>After starting the year with a conference record of 2-4, the Gauchos have matured from their rough start gaining some valuable momentum as they near the Big West Tournament. Coach Williams accredits the team’s solid play to its tough matches against Long Beach State and Hawaii early in its conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“We came out absolutely flat [for Hawaii and Long Beach],” Williams said. “We were humbled by [these losses] and have come out with a much greater sense of urgency.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson will certainly pose as a mismatch on offense for Riverside, gradually coming into his own during the Gauchos’ winning stretch.<br>\nBryson, who earned himself his second nomination as the Big West Player of the Week this year on Monday, propelled the Gauchos to victory last Saturday after scoring a team-high 19 points.</p>\n<p>Connecting from deep five times on Saturday, the fourth-year starter broke James Powell’s record for the most three-pointers in school history, moving to first all-time with 223. Bryson now has 1,523 career points, just 57 shy of seventh place all-time for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bryson’s recent shooting stroke will enable Williams to run spread sets on offense, keeping defenses discipline beyond the arc. The 6’4” guard is currently shooting 61 percent from three in his last two games.</p>\n<p>Bryson, who leads the conference in scoring with 18.5 points per game, has scored double-figures in 25 of 26 games this season.</p>\n<p>As for Head Coach Dennis Cutts and the Highlanders, junior forward Secean Johnson will be the go-to guy on offense. After dismissing All-Big West forward Taylor Johns from the team for undisclosed team violations, Johnson has embraced a larger role for Riverside down in the post.</p>\n<p>Now seeing an increase in minutes, the junior transfer is averaging 19.0 points and 8.0 rebounds in his last two games, contest in which Johns was inactive.</p>\n<p>Johns, last season’s All-Big West First Team honoree, averaged 15.5 points and 7.5 rebounds this year for UCR.</p>\n<p>For Saturday night’s game, the Gauchos must contain seniors Reese Morgan and David Nwaba. Morgan is coming off two career games, scoring 23 points against Cal State Northridge and dropping another 22 in his senior night game against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be another defensive concern for UCSB. The Santa Monica College transfer led the Mustangs in their last outing against Santa Barbara, scoring a team-high 16 points to go along with nine rebounds. Look for Bryson to be matched up with the 6’4” Nwaba as he uses his frame to slash his way to the rim.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also honor seniors Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, John Green and Michael Bryson on Saturday. Williams expects an intense crowd and rowdy atmosphere to be a central component in propelling his seniors to victory.</p>\n<p>“We hope it gets rowdy [on Saturday],” Williams said. “Our seniors deserve it — they’ve had really great careers here and it’ll be great for the student body and community to pay tribute to these kids.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game begins at 7 p.m. The Blue-Green rivalry will be reignited Saturday, March 5 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/","id":352,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[351,350,349],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ending Season at Hawaii, Possible No. 5 Seed at Stake","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_7-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In hopes of securing the No. 5 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, the UCSB women's basketball team will hope to overcome Hawaii as the Rainbow Wahine look to lock the No. 2 seed.

We have to be able to start a game and play with that type of energy and motor to be successful.”</p>\n<p>Currently in fifth-place of the conference standings, the Gauchos enter tonight’s game with an 11-18 overall and 8-7 Big West record. Their current total of eight conference wins is the program’s most since the 2012-13 season, in which UCSB finished with 11.</p>\n<p>After nearly handing conference undefeated UCR its first league loss over the weekend, Hawaii will attempt to improve its 17-10 overall, 10-4 conference record.</p>\n<p>It’s a pivotal final two games for the Rainbow Wahine as they are currently tied with LBSU for the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s pursuit of the No. 4 seed has deterred in the past two weeks, the Gauchos will hope to lock down the fifth seed with a win tonight and a loss by Blue-Green rival Cal Poly, who will face Hawaii this Saturday.</p>\n<p>But before Santa Barbara can look ahead to the postseason, its offense will hope to overcome its inefficient shooting start in its first matchup versus Hawaii.</p>\n<p>It begins with the Gauchos’ pair of sharpshooters—sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller. While they each managed to sink key three-pointers in the fourth quarter of the first game, more will be expected from the two tonight.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the team’s first meeting versus Hawaii with six points on a 2-14 overall and 1-8 shooting performance while Miller went 2-9 from the field and 1-3 from beyond the arc for five points. As of recently, Roper has been plagued by turnovers, finishing with four or more in UCSB’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Both will look to shake their latest shooting slumps as well as Miller has not scored in double-figures in the last three games, while Roper has done so just once during the same span of contests.</p>\n<p>“We were really impatient and undisciplined about trying to drive it and get to the rim on the first side,” Henrickson said. “You have to make the defense move and switch sides, that’ll help both of those two. The fact that we were driving it downhill on the first side and not making the defense work that turned into bad shots and no offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the majority of this season, Coach Henrickson has reassured that the Gauchos’ defense is their best source of offense. UCSB’s testament to defense will be tested tonight as it will attempt to contain senior guard/forward Destiny King.</p>\n<p>King leads the Rainbow Wahine as their only double-figure scorer averaging 10.6 points per game. She scored a game-high 17 points in the first meeting against UCSB, scoring 12 in the second half while finishing 9-12 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Yet, it is her versatility when not shooting the ball that makes her into such a vital component for Hawaii. She also leads the team in steals with 32, is tied for the team lead in assists with 64, and is second on the team and ninth in the Big West in rebounds per game with a 6.1 average.</p>\n<p>Just last week, King became the 11<sup>th</sup> player in Hawaii program history to record career totals of 1,000 points and 500 rebounds. She is currently nine assists away from becoming the fifth Rainbow Wahine player ever to register career totals of 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, and 250 assists.</p>\n<p>“We have to match her effort and intensity on the glass and get her off the glass,” Henrickson said. “You can’t underestimate how hard she plays, you look at her free-throws, and she has 12. You’re getting to the free-throw line because you’re driving it, rebounding it, running in transition, and getting opportunities on the block. In all of those areas is where she got us.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara prepares to face the conference’s top rebounding team, which averages 41.8 per game, the post presence of junior center Je Zhe Newton will be important for the Gauchos at both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>In 26 minutes of play in the first matchup versus the Rainbow Wahine, Newton tallied a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. However, she has not scored over three points in five of the team’s last seven games despite grabbing 12 rebounds in the Gauchos’ 58-55 loss to LBSU.</p>\n<p>“She brings size, there’s no doubt about that” Henrickson said. “She’s got to work to catch the ball and get position where she can receive the ball and finish. Certainly we have to find her; she’s got to protect the rim and defensively rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final game of the season at Hawaii will tip-off at 9 p.m. PST and 7 p.m. HST</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/","id":351,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[350,349,348],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looking to Get Back on Track with Road Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After having its four-match winning streak ended in a 5-2 loss to Oregon last Saturday, the UCSB women's tennis team will hope to bounce back on the road against Santa Clara, San Jose State, and Saint...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will make its last trip to the Bay Area for an action packed weekend.

With a loss taken, the Gauchos were able to bounce back the next day to dominate Fresno State 7-0, winning all doubles and singles matches.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has been playing strong tennis as of late going 6-1 in its last seven matches despite playing five of them on the road. The team also holds a 5-4 record against nationally ranked opponents, which led to the team’s ranking rising as high as No. 27.</p>\n<p>“We try not to focus on just rankings and records and instead look at our season match by match,” Seemann said. “Every team is different, and if we want to win out at home, we have to prepare for every match with equal importance. The rankings and seedings will follow.”</p>\n<p>Recently, the Gauchos have made some big roster moves that could very well have led to their recent success. Junior co-captain Teague Hamilton has rejoined the starting singles lineup and has played in the last three matches on court six for his team.</p>\n<p>In his time, Hamilton has grabbed three straight victories for the Gauchos, all of which have come in straight set sweeps. With Hamilton joining at six, freshman Anders Holm has been bumped up to court four where he has not lost a match all season. Holm currently rides a five-match win streak of his own in singles play.</p>\n<p>Although the teams that Santa Barbara faces this weekend are under .500 on the records, both teams will bring some talent to challenge the Gauchos. Sacramento State has featured the same player in Mikus Losbergs at the No. 1 spot of its singles lineup all year. Losberg will likely face Nathan Eshmade as the Hornet looks to continue his three-match winstreak playing at the top spot for his team. The team has also not lost a match on court six in the past five matches.</p>\n<p>USF will feature Ryan Marker who sports a team best 4-2 singles record playing on court four for the Dons. He will likely face Anders Holm, putting both player’s win streaks on the line.</p>\n<p>“We may have gotten a little ahead of ourselves last week, but I think our match with Pacific really showed us what we need to do as a team,” Seemann explained. “Now we have to go out and show what kind of team we really are and play like we have all season.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will first take on Sacramento State on Friday, March 4 at 1:30 p.m. and will follow on Saturday, March 5 at 1 p.m. with USF.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Bruins began the slugfest thanks to redshirt senior Eric Filia’s two-run homer that put his team up 2-0 after the top of the inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to respond with runs of their own in the bottom of the inning due in large part to blunders by UCLA. The No. 21 team in the country allowed three walks and committed two errors that led to two runs for UCSB. The other was thanks to designated hitter Austin Bush’s sac fly RBI that brought in Calica.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara added two more runs in the second inning thanks to Bush’s single that brought in two more runners. This made the score 5-2 in favor of the home team. UCLA would then respond in the top of the third inning getting three runs and tying the game up at five.</p>\n<p>The third top frame resurgence started when junior outfielder Kort Peterson hit a triple bringing in Filia to score. Junior Luke Persico and redshirt freshman Scott Jarvis also had RBI. In the bottom of the third, however, redshirt sophomore Josh Adams hit a home run (1) to put the Gauchos back up, 6-5.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning UCSB would again add three more runs to its lead courtesy of more wild pitches thrown by the Bruins. Sophomore Clay Fisher started the scoring having an RBI-single. After that the next two runs were scored by wild pitches making the score 9-5 in favor of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>UCLA would add one run in the sixth inning courtesy of a Filia RBI-single down the left-field line, however, it could not do much more than that. The pitching by reshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt, sophomore Kyle Nelson, and sophomore Alex Garcia in the final three innings proved to be too much as the Bruins only mustered one hit.</p>\n<p>“Bullpens are like boxes of chocolate; you never know what you’re going to get.” Checketts said. “We got some guys that are good and are starting to settle into roles.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would add two more runs in the eighth inning thanks to another great hit from Bush and another wild pitch which made the final score 11-6.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, UCLA had many blunders that cost them the game as they had two errors and had four wild pitches which led to three runs by UCSB. It still had some solid performances such as Filia who went 3-4 with a home run and an RBI.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also saw great performances, most notably from Bush who continues hit hot streak. The Big West Field Player of the Week and Gwynn Classic MVP had another big night going 3-4 from the plate with four RBI.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to be hitting this good.” Bush said. “The guys before me in the line-up are doing great and it allows me to see some better pitches that I can take advantage of.”</p>\n<p>It was also good to see Bettancourt bounce back from his disappointing performance last week in which he gave up five runs against St. Mary’s which ultimately doomed them. The junior bounced back in a big way giving up one hit while striking out his four batters.</p>\n<p>“Bettancourt last week wasn’t himself.” Checketts said. “I knew that and I still have great confidence in him and I think what we saw today is what we are going to see going forward.”</p>\n<p>Although the Bruins made their share fair of mistakes, the fact remains that the Gauchos are on fire right now. They have scored over 10 runs in three of their last four games and have been blowing teams out. Only time will tell if this hot hitting can continue, but for right now it is a treat to watch.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next opponent is Oregon in a three-game series which begins Friday, March 4th at PK Park at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Santa Barbara players have made its home gym a very tough place for opponents to play in so far this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB is an impressive 8-1 at home this year with the lone loss coming in a thrilling five-set match against CSULB, the top-ranked team in the nation.</p>\n<p>Having swept their last four opponents when playing at home, securing a first-round home game in the MPSF playoffs could be advantageous for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of our success here has come from being comfortable in our gym,” Seif said. “We have great fans who we hate to disappoint and we’ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of games at home in recent years.”</p>\n<p>In what has been a fortunately injury-free season for the Gauchos, they may be a starter short heading into UCLA. Redshirt junior Matt Marsh, who missed the CBU match after hurting his ankle last week against USC, is listed as questionable for the Wednesday meeting with the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Freshman Corey Chavers filled in nicely for the injured Marsh against Cal Baptist registering 10 kills and six digs, but the team will miss Marsh’s team-high 3.25 kills per set if he is unable to play.<br>\nUCSB will be tested by the Bruins, and Head Coach Rick McLaughlin is preparing his side for yet another top-five opponent.</p>\n<p>“The team is really focused on winning the serve receive battle this week,” Seif said. “UCLA has a lot of really great servers so it’s important for us to put service pressure on them.”</p>\n<p>The team’s focus on defense has been on display in recent weeks as well. Redshirt junior Parker Boehle, who has only missed six sets since MPSF play began, has been rock solid as of late averaging 2.93 digs per set in the last four matches.</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, Boehle and Seif, who is second on the team in digs with 1.67 per set, will be tested by the No. 4 team in the nation. However, the Gauchos have a track record of beating UCLA as they won both meetings last season.</p>\n<p>“From recent years we’ve learned that LA is a very consistent team,” Seif said. “They have smart players with coaches that game plan against their opponents strengths well, and we’ll have to do a lot of mid game adjustments this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is Wednesday against No. 4 UCLA at the Wooden Center at 7 p.m. The teams meet again Friday at Rob Gym at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68772\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68772\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/","id":5034,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5033,5032,5031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Continue Winning Ways Against No. 21 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to upset the No. 21 Bruins and continue its hot start to the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68682\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68682\" data-attachment-id=\"68682\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-01/ucsb-looks-to-continue-winning-ways-against-no-21-ucla/justin-kelly-sends-a-curveball-to-the-batter-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Justin Kelly sends a curveball to the batter.

The Bruins head to Caesar Uyesaka stadium with a 3-4 record, however, they are coming off their first series win of the season after taking two of three from Cal Poly SLO.</p>\n<p>Although the No. 21 team in the country does not currently hold a .500 record, it is still one of the more dangerous teams in the country. UCLA has beaten quality opponents like No. 6 North Carolina and just recently beat Cal Poly SLO 19-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Leading the Bruins on the offensive charge is junior outfielder Kort Peterson.  The Mountain View native currently leads the team in batting average batting .429 (10-24) and leads the team in hits with 10.</p>\n<p>Senior Brett Urabe and redshirt senior Christoph Bono help on the bats as both are tied for first on their team in RBI with 5.</p>\n<p>Another great thing UCLA saw on Saturday’s 19-0 win over SLO was the coming-out party for redshirt freshman Jarvis Scott. In his collegiate debut, the infielder got on base on all six plate appearances, went 5-5 with four runs, three RBI and one walk.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Bruins in this game will be freshman Justin Hooper. The left-handed pitcher has been somewhat shaky in his two innings pitched this season posting a 9.00 ERA after allowing three hits and two runs. Hooper should be weary of his opponents because if he is not careful, he will get blown out of the mound by UCSB’s great hitting prowess.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos carry hot bats into Tuesday’s game coming off a great 36 run, 40 hit weekend that led them to winning the inaugural Tony Gwynn Classic. Just to shed some perspective, the Gauchos scored 36 runs in their three games this past weekend while the Bruins have only scored 40 runs in all of their games played so far this season.</p>\n<p>One particularly hot player coming into this game is designated hitter, Austin Bush. The sophomore was named MVP this past weekend at the tournament for his .636 (7-11) BA, six RBI, six run performance. Bush is also first on the team and the Big West conference in batting average posting a .500 (10-20) BA. He is also second on the team in RBI with eight.</p>\n<p>He is helped by third baseman Ryan Clark. One of two senior starters on the roster, Clark is also coming off a hot tournament performance in which he was name All-Tournament Honoree after posting a .583 (7-12) BA, seven RBI, two runs and one homerun—his first of the season.</p>\n<p>The senior is tied for first on the team and tied for third in the Big West in RBI with 9 runners batted in so far. He is also third in the Big West conference in batting average posting a .481 (13-27) BA.</p>\n<p>Second baseman J.J. Muno is also someone that cannot be forgotten about. The redshirt sophomore has had a great start to the season as he is tied for first on the team in homeruns and RBI with one and nine respectively. He is 19<sup>th</sup> in the conference in batting average with a .333 (11-33) BA.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Gauchos will be sophomore Chris Clements. The right-handed pitcher has had a solid start to the season posting a 2.16 ERA., 15<sup>th</sup> best in the conference, after allowing six hits and two runs on 8.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bullpen is led by sophomore Kyle Nelson who has had an amazing start to the season. In 9.1 innings pitched, the left-handed pitcher has only allowed three hits and no runs. He has also struck out 16 batters, first on the team and third best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s game will be an important one for the Gauchos. It will be a chance to beat a very well respected team in UCLA, gain even more momentum for the long season, and start to show that although they are young they are a team that should not be overlooked, instead feared.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next game is Tuesday, March 1 against No. 21 UCLA at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“Saturday was a tough loss for us and it was great to see our team bounce back like we did,” Junior Co-Captain Teague Hamilton said. “We really responded well as a team.”</p>\n<p>The first match of the weekend was a very lengthy battle for both sides as the deciding point came in the final match of the day. The No. 70 Tigers would capture that win and pull the 4-3 upset over the No. 27 Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After gaining the doubles point, Hamilton added the first singles win of the match to put his team up 2-0. Freshman Anders Holm added a win of his own on court four, giving him his fourth straight in dual match play.</p>\n<p>The Tigers would respond with three huge wins on the top three courts to ice the match at 3-3. The weight of the match would fall upon the shoulders of sophomore Cody Rakela and Pacific’s Jose Chamba on court five.</p>\n<p>Chamba came out on top of the first set grabbing a 6-4 win, but Rakela would bounce back in the second taking a 6-3 win to force a third and final set to decide both the individual match and team competition. The two players exchanged games until they were held at 5-5.</p>\n<p>Chamba would win the next game while holding serve and despite Rakela serving in the 12<sup>th</sup> game, Chamba took another win to close out the match 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 and give his team a 4-3 edge over Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>After dropping a close match to the Tigers, the Gauchos would come back the next day and down the Bulldogs of Fresno State with a 7-0 sweep.</p>\n<p>The match started out on an interesting note as the Bulldogs were forced to play to a disadvantage due to suspensions made on the roster. This caused the Bulldogs to forfeit their match on court three for doubles and court three for singles so the Gauchos started off the match with a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Heading into singles play the Gauchos were in need of just two wins to seal the match, but went above and beyond winning all five of the matches to take a 7-0 win overall.</p>\n<p>Hamilton added his third straight win since joining the starting lineup last week, only dropping three total games on court five. He defeated Jakob Keppelmann 6-2, 6-1 and was the first player to finish for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy about helping my team with some singles wins,” Hamilton said. “I’ve been really getting into my matches and playing some great tennis.”</p>\n<p>Holm added his fifth straight win on court four losing a match low two games to his opponent Patrick Pech. The freshman took a win with identical sets of 6-1, 6-1.</p>\n<p>Junior Co-Captain Morgan Mays added a straight set victory of his own defeating Jeremy Moser on court three 6-3, 6-2.

The Gauchos managed to get back to their winning ways thanks to a huge performance from redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson, who registered a season-high 18 kills, half of which came in the second set.</p>\n<p>The USC match didn’t go as well for redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh however, as he twisted his ankle coming down from a block halfway through the second set, sidelining him for the rest of the tie. He also missed the team’s match versus Cal Baptist, but McLaughlin is hopeful he’ll be ready for the two upcoming meetings with UCLA.</p>\n<p>Apart from the injury to one of its star players, Santa Barbara couldn’t have asked for much better of a night, easing its way to a straight set victory by scores of 25-19, 25-19, and 25-21.</p>\n<p>“I think we looked great,” redshirt senior Austin Kingi said. “Jonah was putting up some great balls for us, Delson is swinging high and hard, and our middles are connecting perfectly.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it was Kingi who led the Gauchos in kills Friday night against Cal Baptist with 12, helping his team to their second sweep of the week (25-20, 25-16, 25-20). The outside hitter has been one of UCSB’s top performers on both offense and defense, averaging 2.39 kills and 1.33 digs per set.</p>\n<p>“My hits have been feeling better and I’ve been feeling healthy overall,” Kingi said. “I’m getting my swing back after six months out.”</p>\n<p>The story of the match, however, was true freshman Corey Chavers, who put on the best performance of his debut season while filling in for the injured Marsh. The first-year player tallied 10 kills, his highest total since the season opener, adding on a season-high six digs.</p>\n<p>“It’s nothing new,” Kingi said. “We all know Corey’s a big offensive player, and when Marsh is down, it’s great to have another weapon on the floor.”</p>\n<p>The standout youngster was one part of a solid team match for the Gauchos, who eased past Cal Baptist. Senior setter Jonah Seif did his usual job, racking up 35 assists, including a couple jaw dropping passes that reminded the home crowd why he was named to the All-American second team last year.</p>\n<p>After dispatching USC and CBU, two of the bottom three teams in the MPSF standings, UCSB will prepare to face its toughest string of matches of the season. Seven of its final ten games come against teams ranked in the top ten of the AVCA Division I-II Coaches Poll.</p>\n<p>“The true test will be when we hit the road again Wednesday to play at UCLA, and it’s another chance for us to see if we are ready to compete with a top five team,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos are two matches against the Bruins, the first at UCLA on Wednesday at 7 p.m., the second at Rob Gym on Friday at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68674\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68674\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/","id":5031,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5030,5029,5028],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Dominate at Tony Gwynn Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB picks up three wins and some nice, shiny hardware after great performances at the Tony Gwynn Classic.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB baseball team has regained whatever confidence it might have lost after the St. Mary’s game thanks to a strong offensive performance that propelled it against quality opponents such as Kentucky, Bryant University, and University of San Diego and led to it winning the inaugural Tony Gwynn Classic.</p>\n<p>The three wins now put the Gauchos at 7-1 overall while Kentucky falls to 3-3 on the year after dropping two of its three games at the tournament.

Then in the third inning junior outfielder Hunter Mercado-Hood hit a sac fly to the deep right and tied the game at one.</p>\n<p>The Toreros then enjoyed a brief 2-1 lead after the top of the fourth as they added one run. The Gauchos responded with a three-run frame that was led by freshman outfielder Michael McAdoo hitting a fielder’s choice that batted one runner in and an error on the play led to another runner scoring. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark hit an RBI single and made the score 4-2 after four full frames.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its hot hitting in the fifth after another three-run bottom frame that seemingly put San Diego away as it could not answer back to that extent. UCSB sealed the championship victory after adding two more runs, compared to SD’s one run, and winning by a final score of 9-3.</p>\n<p>Designated hitter Austin Bush led the team going 3-3 in the championship round adding three runs scored as well. The sophomore was also honored with tournament MVP after a 7-11 weekend which included six RBI and one homer.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore Joe Record also continued his strong start to the season picking up his second win after going 6 1/3 innings deep allowing four hits and two earned runs.</p>\n<p>However, before the Gauchos had the opportunity to take home some nice hardware they first had to defeat previously undefeated Bryant University. They were able to punch their ticket to the championship game and hand the Bulldogs their first loss of the season after their best offensive showing of the year scoring 16 runs on 14 hits.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, Bryant started the scoring in the top of the third adding one run courtesy of junior Matt Albanese, however, it missed out on a great opportunity blowing a bases loaded scenario with only one out in the inning. It was Clark who made a diving catch when the ball was hit his way and turned it into a 5-4-3 double play.</p>\n<p>The senior then continued to help his team hitting his first home-run of the season and tying the game up at one. The Gauchos added three more runs to take a 4-1 lead after three innings of play.</p>\n<p>The game was still somewhat close as the score was 6-2 headed into the seventh inning when UCSB scored seven runs in that frame to put away Bryant. It continued to show its dominance adding three more runs in the final two innings to win the game by an impressive 16-2 score.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore J.J Muno continued his hot start to the season going 2-3 with two RBI. He was helped by Grover who went a perfect 3-3 and also had two RBI. Although the Gauchos had great hitting they were also helped by the Bulldogs eight walks and hitting six additional batters that attributed four runs.</p>\n<p>Pitching was also great as Freshman Noah Davis picked up his first win of the season after five strong innings allowing six hits and two runs while also adding four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Before the Gauchos best offensive output of the season, they had a strong start to the tournament against No. 22 Kentucky. UCSB scored 11 runs on 14 hits and had another strong performance from Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>The junior right-handed pitcher was amazing at one point not allowing a single run until the seventh inning. Bieber then ran out of gas as he was ultimately pulled one out into the sixth inning after allowing three singles. He still picked up the win putting his record at a perfect 2-0.</p>\n<p>Bieber was also helped tremendously by yet another dominant performance by the Gaucho hitters. Five UCSB hitters got extra base hits including Bush’s 430-foot homerun in the top of the seventh inning. The future tournament MVP started his weekend strong going 3-5 and having two RBI.</p>\n<p>The scoring started early for Santa Barbara as it took a 3-0 lead after three runs in the second inning thanks to McAdoo’s RBI single, sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI groundout and Clark’s RBI single. Clark picked up another RBI in the fourth inning after a solid single down the left field line making the score 4-0.</p>\n<p>As Kentucky was unable to score, the Gauchos decided to take advantage scoring four more runs in the fifth inning to take a commanding 8-0 lead. UCSB led 10-0 after the top of the seventh thanks to Bush’s aforementioned HR and Clark’s third RBI of the day.</p>\n<p>Although Kentucky made a strong push in the bottom of the seventh frame scoring three runs, the deficit was too much to overcome and it lost to Santa Barbara 11-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB saw great performances from mostly every player that took part in the game whether it be on the mound or on the plate. All its starters collected at least one hit and only one did not score a run. It was a dominant performance all around yet then again so was the whole tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did a great job of bouncing back after its first loss of the season. Instead of sulking they went out and outscored their three weekend opponents by a score of 36-9. Many, if not all, players had great tournament performances highlighted by Bush’s MVP and Clarks All-Tournament Honoree play.</p>\n<p>This confidence-boosting weekend could not have come at a better time as now UCSB must turn its sights to one of their toughest opponents on its schedule this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Tuesday, March 1<sup>st</sup> against No. 21 UCLA at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
