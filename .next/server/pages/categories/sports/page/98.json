Spencer Brandt/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>While losing isn’t an embracing result, a team’s attitude after its loss definitely influences its performance on the court. Despite falling to 4-10 and 0-3 in conference, the demeanor of the UCSB women’s volleyball team remains resolute as it continues to search for its first win in nine games.</p>\n<p>Through just three games, Santa Barbara has now faced the top three programs in the Big West. It managed to win the opening sets in both of its matches, but became prone to allowing various scoring stretches, which led to UCSB losing three consecutive final sets to end the game in its two home conference openers. Missing from UCSB’s starting lineup this weekend were two of its most prominent players in redshirt senior Hanna Nielson and sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman.</p>\n<p>Prior to the beginning of Big West play, Cal State Northridge was once in the same losing quandary as the Gauchos. The Matadors entered conference play with an eight-game losing streak but have recently been the most astounding team, winning its first two conference matchups. CSUN overcame its early set loss and improved to an undefeated three wins in conference, beating UCSB 3-1 in set scores of 25-27, 25-14, 25-20 and 25-20. The Matadors are now 4-12 overall with a 3-1 Big West record after losing to Cal Poly yesterday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Matadors seemed destined to win the initial set, facing set-point with a 24-21 lead that led to a UCSB timeout. Yet, the quick break benefited UCSB as it made a substitution that put senior opposite Britton Taylor in the game. The change in rotation was the starting point in the Gauchos’ comeback as Taylor thumped the ball for a kill, trimming the deficit to two at 22-24. Back-to-back kills by freshman Annie Hasselmann and junior Elizabeth Sheffield put the finishing touches on Santa Barbara’s 6-1 run, securing the set victory 27-25.</p>\n<p>After achieving a .381 hitting clip in the first set, UCSB’s offense continued to prosper as it opened the second set with a 4-0 run. But Northridge responded with a 6-0 rally of its own to take a 6-4 lead and force a Santa Barbara timeout. The Matadors never lost the lead again and a 9-3 run locked a 25-14 second set win.</p>\n<p>During the second set and latter periods of the match, there was some displeasure expressed by UCSB Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch toward the officiating. Specifically, her complaints were directed toward the line judge for some calls that seemed to favor the Matadors as they went on to win sets three and four.</p>\n<p>When asked if the calls had an influence on the match’s result: “it had an influence on some of the frustrations, but we’ve got to clean up our side of the ball and that’s something uncontrollable that we can’t worry about,” she said. “We played great in set one, we hit over .300 which is excellent. We have to realize that teams are going to adjust and we have to be more adaptable. We have to be quicker to adjust and I think that was something that hurt us tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended Friday’s match with a .164 hitting average while CSUN managed to hit a clip of .200 plus throughout the match’s entirety (.323 match average). Senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson led the Matadors’ assertive attack with a match-high 19 kills. Northridge’s best hitting performance appeared in the fourth set — it clinched victory with a dominant .448 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>A repeat of last season’s 16-0 conference record is now fictitious for No. 24 Long Beach State after being upset 3-1 by Cal Poly on Friday, snapping the 49ers’ 23-match Big West winning streak. However, LBSU accepted the loss and is back to its winning ways after its 3-1 victory over UCSB. Long Beach bounced back for the win in sets of 18-25, 25-19, 26-24 and 25-12.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65008\" style=\"width: 276px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"938735734\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65022\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65008\" data-attachment-id=\"65008\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/shauna-klein-receives-the-ball-from-her-opponent-steven-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Shauna Klein receives the ball from her opponent.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB managed to take advantage of the vulnerable 49ers in the first set of Saturday’s contest. A 9-4 run set the tone for its offense — three-straight service aces by Sheffield helped Santa Barbara finish the opening set with a .452 hitting clip. UCSB maintained its lead, but LBSU trimmed the deficit to four-points at 15-19, which led to a Santa Barbara timeout. It helped prevent a shift in momentum which led to the Gauchos’ protecting their lead and earning the 18-25 set victory.</p>\n<p>Hoping to avoid consecutive upset losses, Long Beach State answered back with a 25-19 win in the second set. Starting the third set with a 7-1 run, Santa Barbara inched closer to a 2-1 lead. But the 49ers’ 8-2 run notched the score at 9-9. A series of lead changes and ties would occur, when tied 24-24, kills by freshman outside hitter Megan Kruidhof and freshman libero Mykah Wilson snagged the 26-24 third set victory for Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The results of the third set proved to be the deciding factor in yesterday’s match. “They started taking more chances with their serve and we couldn’t answer — we got stuck in a couple rotations,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need to be able to answer quicker because we were in control of that set.”</p>\n<p>In spite of double-digit kill performances by seniors Ali Barbeau and Taylor, as well as 39 assists by freshman setter Annie Hasselmann , the 49ers’ stunning .625 hitting percentage in the match’s final set stamped their victory. LBSU sits at 13-4, 3-1  in conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB finds itself on the road for weekday and weekend matchups. The Gauchos will face UC Davis this Thursday, Oct. 8 at 7:00 p.m. at The Pavilion. On Saturday, Oct. 10, they will visit Cal Poly for a 7:00 p.m. match in Robert A.

Bring it on. Read me the NFL record book, aka Peyton Manning’s biography. Make it about jewelry, how the 31-year-old QB has just one ring and miles to go if he’s going to catch Tom Brady or Joe Montana.<br>\nSay he isn’t even the best to put on a Packer uniform. I’m standing by my claim.<br>\nIf you saw Mr. Discount Double Check’s performance against the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday Night Football, then you saw in a nutshell why I think he’s the most complete signal caller of all-time. His stat line of five touchdowns, 24-35 passing, 33 yards and a quarterback rating of 138.5 says a lot, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.<br>\nRodgers is deadly accurate whether he’s standing in the pocket or on the move. He’s so quick and mobile, with feet that never stop hopping, it’s almost impossible to bring him down. Even when there is pressure in his face, he has a lightning quick trigger and a Spidey-sense presence that allows him to throw ridiculous fade-away bullets right into his receiver’s chest.<br>\nIt’s like watching Madden, except in real life. Wait… isn’t that the point of Madden?<br>\nIt can be argued that in this day and age, performances like this happen all the time around the league. Even a rookie like Marcus Mariota can throw for four TDs and no picks in a game. After all, we are currently living in the era of iPhones and inflated passing numbers.<br>\nWith Rodgers though, it’s almost assured that we’re going to see sky-high numerical dominance every single time he steps on the field. That’s why his QB rating of 106.8 is the highest in the history of the NFL and the only one above 100 (Tony Romo and Peyton Manning are distant runner-ups at 97.6 and 97.3, respectively).<br>\nI’m not saying he’s the greatest quarterback ever. That’s obviously a boringly impossible-to-prove statement to make.<br>\nBut in terms of the accuracy, the mobility, the numbers, the consistency and the overall feeling of helplessness that he gives to opposing defenses, I don’t think there’s another quarterback in any situation that I would ever take over him.<br>\nSure, Brady is the ultimate winner. Sure, Peyton is the ultimate robot. And, yes, our parents once watched Dan Marino and Joe Montana and will never change their minds about who the best ever is.<br>\nIn the end, whether he’s on my fantasy team or the team I root for, I’m picking Brett Favre’s patient former backup to lead me to victory, and I don’t think there’s anyone in the NFC that can stop him.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cardinals Are For Real</strong><br>\nAfter Week Three of last year, I put the Arizona Cardinals’ chances of winning the Super Bowl at zero. The reason? Quarterback Carson Palmer had torn his ACL for the second time in his career.<br>\nEven without Palmer in the lineup, the Cardinals proved just how good they were by starting off 9-1 and making the playoffs with third-string quarterback Ryan Lindley heading the offense.<br>\nFast forward to now. Arizona is 3-0 with the most points in the league and the third-fewest points allowed.<br>\nWhat stood out to me most while watching what could be the beginning of the end for Colin Kaepernick in the Cards’ 47-7 demolition of the 49ers on Sunday was just how ruthless Arizona Head Coach Bruce Arians is. Despite going into the half leading 31-7, Arians’ message to his team was simply this: “Step on their throats.”<br>\nThis isn’t to be confused with the message that Sean Payton has for his New Orleans Saints to literally step on their opponents’ throats. This is more in the scoreboard sense. #bountyjokes<br>\nAll humor aside, I don’t know about you, but if I were a six-foot, 230-pound athlete with a super strong frame, lightning speed and physically violent capabilities, then Arians is the kind of guy that I would want to play for. Unfortunately for me, I’m about 60 pounds shy of being that.<br>\nNow I’m not 100 percent sure what goes on behind the scenes with the New England Patriots other than cheating, but I’m guessing Bill Belichick is sending the same kind of message to his players as they put 40 and 50 burgers up on teams, regardless if it’s in the rain or snow. That’s just one of the many reasons why he’s won four Super Bowls.<br>\nRight now, the Cardinals have it all: an excellent coaching staff, a tenacious defense with playmakers all around, an offense that seems to be drinking water from the fountain of youth, not to mention their supply of young studs like Michael Floyd, John Brown and Andre Ellington.<br>\nIf the Cardinals can stay healthy, they are the favorites to make it to the NFC Championship alongside Green Bay. They have the right mindset to do it.<br>\nIf there’s anything that the 2009 runner-up Cardinals, led by old dog Kurt Warner, or the 2007 and 2012 New York Giants have taught us, it’s that it just takes one solid run in January to make it to the greatest show on turf, America style.<br>\nCarson Palmer, just watch your knees and get Larry Fitzgerald that ring already.

The Matadors started slowly in 2015, but won their last three games on the road to improve to 4-3-1 heading into conference play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a team, UCSB has been the best on offense this season, currently leading the Big West with 18 goals through nine games. Junior Nick DePuy has been a model of consistency since moving from the midfield to forward midway through last season, scoring 16 goals in his 22 games up front. He currently leads the Big West with seven goals and was named this week’s Big West Offensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong came into the year as a player to watch coming out of Cate School and he has not disappointed. The lefty notched his fourth assist of the year in the Gauchos’ 4-0 win over San Diego this past Sunday, making him the conference’s sole leader in assists.</p>\n<p>Also providing an offensive punch has been sophomore Ahinga Selemani, who transferred from Michigan after his freshman year. The 5-8 forward has already matched his totals from last year with three goals and is currently tied with DePuy and one other player for first in the conference with 28 shots.</p>\n<p>Injuries have begun to wear UCSB down a bit, with several starters being kept out of the lineup in recent games. Juniors Ismaila Jome and Drew Murphy were unavailable to close out the Gauchos’ last four games, while sophomore center back Jeff Quezada suffered an injury in practice that kept him out for last weekend’s games.</p>\n<p>In Quezada’s absence, the defense has looked shaky at times, but a pair of freshmen in defender Sam Strong and goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg have been solid all year. The Gauchos are currently ranked fifth in the conference having allowed 11 goals to opposing teams.</p>\n<p>UCI has struggled to start the year, but it hosts UCSB tonight seemingly having solved its offensive problems which caused it to stumble out of the gates. Through their first seven games, the Anteaters were shutout four times, putting away just three goals total.</p>\n<p>In the past week, however, they have found a rhythm, putting away four scores in a win over LMU on Thursday, followed up by a three goal effort in a 4-3 overtime loss to UCLA.</p>\n<p>The second half could be worrisome for the Gauchos, who have conceded eight of their 11 goals allowed after halftime. This might favor the Anteaters, who have put away all but one of their 10 goals in the second stanza.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Ivan Canales leads the offense in goals and assists with three each.</p>\n<p>The Matadors host Cal Poly tonight and UCSB on Saturday having won three consecutive games on the road. They have dominated the conference awards in recent weeks, with the past two Defensive Player of the Week winners and the Offensive Player of the Week from two weekends ago.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Adam Hobbs took home the most recent defensive honors, stopping a penalty and maintaining a 1-0 shutout against San Diego last Friday. Senior defender and captain Trevor Morley earned the award the week prior, holding Saint Mary’s and Santa Clara to just one goal in 180 minutes while adding two goals of his own on penalties.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, redshirt senior Carlos Gonzalez leads the team with four goals, three of which he scored in 29 minutes off the bench at Saint Mary’s to earn his first ever Offensive Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play at UC Irvine tonight at 7 p.m. and will head to Northridge to take on the Matadors Saturday at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/","id":1507,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1506,1505,1504],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Soccer Opens Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Following a controlled 1-0 victory against Pacific, the UCSB women’s soccer team tops off their first Big West match of the year with a one-game road trip to 3-6-1 University of Hawaii.

The Gauchos were on a two-game losing skid after dropping matches against CSU Northridge and Long Beach before clinching their first conference win at home against none other than the Rainbow Wahine. Despite a rough start to last season Stumpf is very optimistic for this young team along with valuable veterans such as Amanda Ball and Savannah Francis coming back into the lineup.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s going to be nice to have a deeper bench and more experience in our group specifically from Amanda and Savannah, Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Ball and Francis will be a tremendous boost to Santa Barbara’s already-sharp rotation. As a freshman, Ball started seven matches at forward for her team racking up two goals in her first two home appearances against Cleveland State and Southern Utah. Adding some well needed offensive experience, Ball will mesh well in that front line with freshman forward Mallory Hromatko and junior midfielder Sara Feder. Ball has not seen action since UCSB’s double-OT tie against San Jose State on August 28th.</p>\n<p>Heading into her senior year, Savannah Francis will likely be a primary leader both on offense and defense for UCSB. The La Mirada, CA native was on the field in all 19 matches for her team, starting 16 of them. Francis finished the season with two goals and one assist, ironically being Amanda Ball’s first career goal against the Vikings. A gruesome foot injury has sidelined Francis for 13 games this season.</p>\n<p>“These players coming back will likely see some minutes off the bench [this Thursday],” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have some assignments to be aware of as they face a Rainbow Wahine team coming off a 2-0 victory at home against Brigham Young University. Sophomore Dani Crawford looks to carry the load for Hawaii leading the team with three goals and six points at the forward position. This will be a big matchup for defenders Ryan Kokoska and Sydney Fuertes to slow Crawford down and lower her scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Stumpf is not only optimistic in his team’s play this weekend but also how Rainbow Wahine Stadium will fit their mode of play.</p>\n<p>“[Rainbow Wahine Stadium] is quite nice. It’s big, flat, fast, and suits the style of soccer we want to play,” said Stumpf.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to the big island this Thursday for a 10 p.m. pacific time match against Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 1, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/","id":1505,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1504,1503,1502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain Motivated Heading into Conference Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C480&ssl=1","description":"After a difficult conference opening match against No. 10 Hawai'i, UCSB women's volleyball knows the pressure is slowing rising and wins versus Cal State Northridge and No. 24 Long Beach State this we...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Adversity is an essential element of sports.

During non-conference play, the Gauchos averaged a .206 hitting clip. However, in their conference opener, they achieved a dismal .121 hitting percentage. Since losing 3-1 to SMU, the Gauchos have not had two players record double digit kills in the same contest.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing is we just have to keep getting better,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “If we keep getting better, we’re going to start to see the results we want in terms of the scoreboard.”</p>\n<p>Despite having just one win prior to the start of Big West play, Northridge has triumphantly kicked off its conference schedule. The Matadors, now 3-11, are on a two-game winning streak after sweeping UC Irvine and a 3-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Through just two conference games, CSUN sits atop the Big West in various statistical categories. Northridge currently leads the conference in kills (110), kills per set (15.71), assists (100), assists per set (14.29), and points (135.0).</p>\n<p>Bearing the offensive torch for the Matadors is senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson. She has been a key centerpiece to CSUN’s progression as she leads the team in kills (182) and blocks (24). Stinson has recorded double-digit kills in nine of Northridge’s games, and just this past Monday was named Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week. A well-deserved honor, as Stinson is coming off a weekend in which she tallied a total of 39 kills and averaged 5.57 kills per set to compliment a smashing .423 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Molding into Northridge’s next elite star at the outside hitter position is freshman Aeryn Owens. Despite a meager .127 hitting average so far this season, she ranks second in CSUN’s kills total with 111. Since the award’s creation prior to the 2014 season, Owens became the first Matador to receive the Big West Freshman of the Week award after chalking up 29 kills and a .313 hitting percentage in the team’s first two conference matches.</p>\n<p>The reigning champions of the Big West Conference, Cal State Long Beach has its eyes set on a repeat performance of its undefeated, 16-0 conference record of last season. Currently 12-3, the 49ers are off to an emphatic start at 2-0 after last weekend’s home conference opener.</p>\n<p>Cal State Long Beach’s determined foundation of players certainly helped pave the way for the 49ers’ success. Last season’s Big West Player of the Year, senior Jenelle Hudson became just the second setter in CSULB history to earn the award. She currently leads the Big West in assists with a total of 587 and sits second in assists per set with 10.30.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Ashley Murray was also recognized for her performance in last year’s remarkable run as she was the recipient of the 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year award. Aiding Murray at the middle blocker position is Ball State transfer, senior Hayley Benson. She recently earned Big West Defensive Player of the Week after tallying seven blocks and two blocks per set in the 49ers conference opener.</p>\n<p>Despite preparing for its second and third conference games of the season, the stakes are slowly heightening for UCSB as a win could reinvigorate the Gauchos’ hopes this season.</p>\n<p>“Right now our focus is first on CSUN and then we’ll look at Long Beach as well,” Lantagne Welch said. “It comes down to the process. Let’s put together what we did well this weekend and add a little bit more to it. We have the advantage of playing at home and the students are now back, and that could have a lot of stuff go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB versus Cal State Northridge will proceed at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, Following the Gauchos’ Friday bout is their Saturday match versus No. 24 Cal State Long Beach. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/","id":5098,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5097,5096,5095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Soccer Gradually Heating Up, Prepare for Conference Opener at Hawai’i","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara managed to prevail for the 1-0 victory over Pacific.

Mallory Hromatko made her mark in the match’s 64th minute, driving down the right line off a nice lead pass by Parque.  The freshman forward made her way to the middle of the box and sneaked a strike down into the back left of the post giving UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Pacific changed their system [in the second half] and we moved our lineup to three strikers to have one more body closer to goal,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “It felt like it was just a matter of time because we had more looks [from that switch] and it ended up being our girl Mallory.”</p>\n<p>Hromatko has been a key component for her team’s success; racking up five goals and four assists all in non-conference play. Earning All-Big West Player of the Week honors following her game against Texas, Stumpf will likely keep Hromatko at the forward position heading into the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“She’s getting a lot of looks at the ball and it only takes one real good one where she can place one firmly into a corner,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the day with nine corner kicks and 13 shots, ten of them on goal.  Senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter also made her presence known in the goal box, making a crucial save in the 70th minute to preserve the team’s 1-0 lead. UCSB’s consistent defense held the Tigers to one corner and one shot at the goal.</p>\n<p>Freshman defender Ryan Kokoska was a vital part of the Gauchos’ defense keeping the ball in the middle of the field and giving her teammates scoring opportunities. Kokoska accredits her efforts to the ability of her team to play as a unit.</p>\n<p>“We have so many strong individuals on our team that’s what makes us do so well,” Kokoska said.  “We’re a team together on and off the field and that will help us heading into conference.”</p>\n<p>Ending non-conference play on a good note, the Gauchos are ready for their Big West opener against Hawaii this Thursday, Oct. 1st. The Rainbow Wahine have a record of 3-6-1.</p>\n<p>The University of Hawaii will be fresh off its 2-0-overtime victory against BYU this past Friday. Look for forward Dani Crawford to make an impact for the Rainbow Wahine as the sophomore has racked up three goals for her team, including one goal in overtime contest.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ road conference opener will take place at 10 p.m. in Aloha Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

We had high expectations of playing well and we didn’t play well,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The key to Akron was to get wide play, to get service, to get players in the box, and about 25 minutes in we weren’t able to get that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After surviving early offensive pressure from the Gauchos, particularly coming from sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani who had a team-high three shots on the night, the Zips found themselves in a great position picking off a poorly placed back pass in the 35<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg reacted quickly to make a sliding save on Sam Gainford’s first attempt on goal, but the sophomore forward was first to the rebound and he scored easily. UCSB went into the half trailing 1-0, the first time it faced a deficit going into halftime all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“Our back line was out of sorts, but the reality is we gave them that first goal and that allowed Akron to sit in with seven guys,” Vom Steeg said. “Coaching-wise, it was absolutely frustrating because I didn’t think that we had a lot of options available to us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Things didn’t get much better for the Gauchos from there. Akron was able to pack up on the defensive side for the rest of the game, stifling any half-chances UCSB could conjure up in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We looked a little tired. We had to chase the game after we went down and Akron was very good at staying in and keeping everybody in front of them,” Vom Steeg said. “Anytime you have to take the game to the other team, you need something to get a goal – something to change the momentum – and we just never got a goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Still searching for an equalizer in the 87<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute, an unfortunate attempt by the Gauchos to clear the ball from deep in their territory was deflected right to forward Stuart Holthusen. Vom Steeg rushed to meet the sophomore on the right side of the box, but the Akron man was able to place a shot past the keeper’s left and inside the near post to put the game away at 2-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After being shutout for just the first time this season, the Gauchos bounced back strong on Sunday, looking more like the team that won 4-2 at UCLA just one week ago. UCSB was firing on all cylinders, scoring as many goals as San Diego had shot attempts with four.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Freshman defender Sam Strong picked up his second goal of the season just over eight minutes in, capitalizing on a rebound after a header from Selemani was saved wide by USD sophomore goalkeeper Thomas Olsen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The action picked up again in the second half, as UCSB put the game away with a pair of goals separated by just over a minute. Selemani was set up by a great run from freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong, who led a counterattack all the way down the left wing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Acheampong cut it back to find Selemani at the top of the box, where he found space away from his defender and blast a left-footed shot in off the keeper’s gloves at the near post. The first-year Gaucho has proven to be a solid number two attacking option alongside Nick DePuy, notching his third goal of the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Speaking of DePuy, after what has become a rare occasion with the junior failing to find the back of the net on Friday, the 6-4 forward put the game away with a goal in the 60<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute. A Torero turnover gave junior midfielder Josue Espana the opportunity to send in a cross from deep down the left wing. Just as he has been so many times, DePuy was the first to the ball, knocking a shot past Olsen at the far post to make it 3-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">DePuy now has seven goals on the season, two more than anyone else in the Big West. As a team, the Gauchos have been outstanding on offense, scoring an average of two goals per game. Acheampong also leads the conference with four assists, while Espana and junior left back Ismaila Jome, are tied for second with three each.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Making his debut for the Gauchos, freshman forward Jonah Adomakoh came off the bench to add another score, beating Olsen with a well-placed shot on a breakaway down the right side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB outshot San Diego 13-4 on the night, including 8-2 in shots on goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Vom Steeg had a relatively simple night with two saves, a much more relaxed outing compared to Friday when he finished with a career-best seven saves and the Gauchos fell for the first time at home this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Injuries have begun to take a toll on UCSB, with several key starters missing action in recent games. Ankle injuries have kept Jome and junior midfielder Drew Murphy out since UCSB’s game against College of Charleston on September 18, while sophomore center back Jeff Quezada missed this past weekend’s action after being injured in practice. Sophomore defender Fuad Adeniyi has gotten the start at center back during Quezada’s two-game absence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Santa Barbara will head back on the road this weekend to open up conference play against UC Irvine on Thursday and Cal State Northridge on Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/","id":1502,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1501,1500,1499],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Inconsistencies Too Costly in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball opened its conference schedule with a road contest against No. 11 Hawai'i.

The Rainbow Wahine defeated UCSB 25-13, 25-14, 25-19. The beginning of Big West play symbolized a clean slate for Santa Barbara, but unfortunately the team’s losing slump extended to seven games. UCSB is now 4-8, 0-1 in conference play and were swept for the fourth time in its last five games. The Gauchos’ offensive errors served as a setback against a dominant Hawaii team.

We did that at times, we just didn’t sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Last season marked the end of the Rainbow Wahine’s illustrious streak of 19 consecutive conference championships, a winning stretch that combined their success in both the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and Big West conferences, respectively. With this year’s pre-season prediction to earn a first-place finish in the Big West poll, it was a prominent first step for a Hawaii team that is determined to regain its conference notoriety. The Rainbow Wahine improved to 12-1 and are now 2-0 versus Big West opponents after sweeps of UCSB and Cal Poly this weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nearly 7,000 people filled Hawaii’s Stan Sheriff Center on Friday, indicating the long-awaited conference opener. Despite the daunting atmosphere, UCSB managed to hold its ground in the match’s beginning.</p>\n<p>A combination of kills, one service ace and one assisted block helped Santa Barbara go on an early 5-2 run. Still, a mentally well-equipped team like Hawaii did not panic as it rallied back with a 4-0 run of its own, taking a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s lead remained at a tight margin, but a kill by junior opposite Nikki Taylor triggered the team’s offensive surge to close the set. Up 15-12, Taylor’s attack sparked Hawaii’s 10-1 run to win the game’s first set, taking the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the one-set deficit, UCSB continued to trade points with Hawaii in the opening of the second set. Yet, tied 7-7, Santa Barbra’s inability to limit its self-inflicted mistakes contributed to the Rainbow Wahine having a match-best .452 hitting clip. Hawaii surely benefited from its attacking success as it went on two 6-0 runs, the second scoring spurt gave the Rainbow Wahine a 23-12 lead. Helping capture the 25-14 set win were two kills by junior setter Tayler Higgins and sophomore middle hitter Emily Maglio.</p>\n<p>UCSB remained motivated in its quest to trim Hawaii’s lead. While the Gauchos’ ongoing errors persisted in the match’s last set, their offense improved to a team-high .258 hitting percentage. Three different Gauchos tallied a total of six kills, while sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman led UCSB in kills for the fourth straight match with seven.</p>\n<p>Still, Hawaii’s outstanding hitting stretch continued as it registered a .433 clip. Leading the Rainbow Wahine was an imposing performance by Higgins. Last week’s espnW Player of the Week, Higgins tallied a match-high 14 kills to go along with a .464 hitting night.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii outhit UCSB, freshman libero Emilia Petrachi logged a match-high 19 digs. However, it was Santa Barbara’s insufficiency at the net that plagued its defense. While UCSB had no blocking errors, the Gauchos blocked just six of Hawaii’s attacking attempts. Not only were the Rainbow Wahine able to capitalize offensively, but they also strived on defense with a total of 19 blocks. In addition to Maglio’s eight kills and .615 hitting clip, she notched a match-high of six blocks to help Hawaii win the final set, 25-19.</p>\n<p>Certainly the Rainbow Wahines’ performance on both sides of the net must be acknowledged, but UCSB’s errors proved too costly against a powerhouse program like Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I think Hawaii is a great team. They have no real weakness and they had a huge size advantage on us,” Lantagne Welch said. “I actually thought we played better than the score indicated. If you hit .300 against just about any team you’re gonna win. We just didn’t put enough pressure on them or their offense. We didn’t serve tough at all and we let them off the hook that way.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to the Thunderdome this Friday, Oct. 2nd to host its conference home opener versus Cal State Northridge at 7:00 p.m. UCSB continues its home stand with a match versus No. 25 Long Beach State on Saturday, Oct. 3rd at 7:00 p.m. as well.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

consecutive wins were put to rest this past Sunday. The Gaucho women’s soccer team suffered a heart-aching loss at home to University of Dayton as two early goals in the match’s first and second halves gave the Flyers an advantage, eventually leading to their 2-1 victory.</p>\n<p>The loss temporarily brought the Gauchos to a record of 5-3-1, while Dayton improved to 2-7.</p>\n<p>The Flyers managed to strike first in the game’s fifth minute as redshirt sophomore midfielder Libby Leedom received a cross toward the middle of the box and placed the ball in the bottom left of the goal.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Following the start of the second half, senior forward Ashley Campbell helped Dayton capitalize on a Gaucho miscue by scoring on a screamer in the ninth minute, booting the ball from way beyond the 18-yard box into the back right of the net. From that point on it was an uphill battle for UCSB, a situation they were not too familiar with prior to their overtime victory against other Atlantic-10 opponent Duquesne.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing by two points, the Gauchos answered back in the 58th minute. Junior center midfielder Sara Feder attacked the middle and connected on a crossing assist from freshman forward Mallory Hromatko for a header score. But as time expired, the UCSB score occurred too late and Dayton pulled off the 2-1 upset. In spite of taking a total of 13 shot attempts, Santa Barbara’s quick striking tactics may have been too overbearing in its game plan.</p>\n<p>“I think consistency is a big focal point of our team goals,” Coach Paul Stumpf said. “I would love a consistent moniker of playing hard, effective and efficient soccer to rub off on us.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, last night’s match against CSU Bakersfield provided them with an opportunity to quickly overcome the disappointing loss. As far as the team’s demeanor and overall attitude with the conference season nearing, Coach Stumpf believes there is still a lot to be learned from the final action before Big West play begins.</p>\n<p>The last time UCSB faced off against Bakersfield was Sept. 14th during which the Gauchos cruised to a 2-0 victory at Harder Stadium. Angelisa Cortez scored an unassisted goal in the 18th minute that put her team in position to win the game.</p>\n<p>Last night, Santa Barbara earned its third shutout victory of the season in its 3-0 win over the Roadrunners. Bakersfield entered Wednesday’s match with a record of 2-5-1, hoping for similar results in which UCSB would be the victim of another upset but were unlucky.</p>\n<p>It was somewhat of a slow start for the Gauchos’, but a score by Hromatko jumpstarted UCSB’s fast-paced scoring run. Santa Barbara’s advantage in corner kicks definitely turned the match in its favor as UCSB recorded eight to Bakersfield’s zero.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ benefited from their landslide of corner kicks with scores by freshman midfielder Jessica Clegg in the 51st minute and Feder in the 61st minute.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara back to its winning ways, the Gauchos’ are now 6-3-1, while the Roadrunners hold a record of 2-6-1. UCSB will return to host the 1-5-1 Pacific Tigers this Saturday at 1 p.m. at Harder Stadium. This will be the Gauchos’ final non-conference game of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of September 24, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64792\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/gauchos-bounce-back-after-loss-to-dayton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64792\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/gauchos-bounce-back-after-loss-to-dayton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/gauchos-bounce-back-after-loss-to-dayton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/gauchos-bounce-back-after-loss-to-dayton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/gauchos-bounce-back-after-loss-to-dayton/","id":1500,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1499,1498,1497],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fantasy Sports Island: NFL Week 3","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14-11-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14-11-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As we all rejoice the return of football, NFL Sundays are a lot more entertaining and interactive with the existence of fantasy football.

MLB playoffs are right around the corner, the NBA preseason is just days away from commencing and — most importantly — the NFL is back! That kind of thrill makes me want to do a Cam Newton front flip and scream in honor of America.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the only thing that many would find even more exciting than the NFL season itself is the fact that fantasy football is also back! Thank goodness we all have something to compete in amongst ourselves, because simply watching our teams just isn’t enough anymore. This is especially true for someone like myself who experiences much more success on the fantasy end, as opposed to watching my Eagles sadly stoop to 0-2. As much as I can lament my superbowl-less team, that isn’t why you are all here. Let’s get down to some fantasy, which, despite the name, is very real to us fans.</p>\n<p><strong>Sit and Start</strong><br>\n<em>DeAngelo Williams, RB Pitt</em><br>\nIf you’re a fan of those hard-nosed vets like I am, surely you were excited to see ex-Panther DeAngelo Williams have so much success in Le’Veon Bell’s absence. Unfortunately for DW, this may mean the last time we ever see him get 20 carries, or even 10 for that matter. Bell’s return will strip a significant portion of touches from Williams and, in return, will give Bell a majority of the team’s workload in the backfield. Hopefully, those of you who drafted Williams on your team did not pick him up to be a starting back. Rather, he provides a ton of potential as a backup or even a part-time flex. The man had 204 rush yards and three TD’s in just two games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Matthew Stafford, QB Det </em><br>\nSince 2011, many fantasy owners think of Stafford as a god, when really he is just a guy who’s asked to throw downfield and land the ball somewhere for Calvin Johnson to miraculously make a catch. Although he does put up fantasy numbers, he is not an elite QB and he is very susceptible to even an average pass defense. The Denver Broncos’ secondary and fiesty pass rush he will be facing is far from average. They haven’t allowed a single touchdown pass this year. That being said, Stafford’s matchup does not favor him whatsoever. Bottom line: start your backup this week or go find Cousins, Mariota or Winston on the wire.</p>\n<p><em>Arian Foster, RB Hou</em><br>\nSo you didn’t hear this from me, but Arian is apparently going Kobe on his injury and shattering his recovery records. Let’s just hope he has an easier transition than Kobe did at his ripe old age. Word is that he will suit up this week against Tampa Bay, which has been torn up by the run game so far this season. I would keep an eye on him ’til Sunday morning, but if he is ready, he could be the boost you need this week.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot Off the Wire</strong><br>\n<em>Michael Crabtree, WR Oak (37 percent owned on ESPN platform)</em><br>\nEven a “sorry receiver like Michael Crabtree” has potential to be reborn in a league like this. This is surely possible on a team where he can share the spotlight with a young rookie looking to make a name, and a QB who is determined to be the best of this new young crew of passers in the past couple drafts. Unfortunately for Amari Cooper, he is their number one option, which means he will be on Joe Haden Island this week when they head to Cleveland. Expect Crabtree to be on Derek Carr’s radar all game long. He is likely available in your league.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Jones, RB Was (16.4 percent owned)  </em><br>\nIf you haven’t heard of him already, this rookie back has emerged onto the scene after rushing for 123 yards and two TD’s on 20 carries against a solid Rams defense. Even with Mr. Consistency, Alfred Morris, in front of him there is no way that he will not see the ball this week when they take on the Giants. Morris is still getting his touches, too, so no real loss in value, but it seems there may be a bit more sharing moving forward. This week will be the real stability test for Jones.</p>\n<p><em>Ronnie Hillman, RB Den (49.7 percent owned)</em><br>\nHillman has potential to be a great back but it is more so the struggles of CJ Anderson that will draw Ronnie’s name this week. The Broncos play in the motor city this week, and it will be a perfect time to test out Hillman’s wheels and see if he is the guy they would like to move forward with. This is your guy if you’re too impatient for CJ, Demarco Murray, or Jeremy Hill to start doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by the island this week!

the road this past Monday, UCSB men’s soccer Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg joked that maybe this could be the team to finally win a game at UCLA. Thanks to a second-half scoring outburst, the Gauchos’ pulled away from the Bruins for a 4-2 win and their first-ever road win against their UC counterpart.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to Harder Stadium this weekend for a pair of games against No. 9 Akron on Friday and San Diego on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With its second consecutive win and its first over UCLA since 2011, UCSB improves to 4-2-1 this season. The Bruins have struggled to start the season by their standards, as the loss was their fourth in five games, bringing their record to 2-4.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The winning formula for the Gauchos prior to Monday night’s game had been coming out strong in the first half, scoring first in each of their opening six games. That wasn’t the case this time around, however.<br>\nAfter conceding the opening goal on a penalty to UCLA’s Larry Ndjock 28 minutes in, UCSB answered back with four straight goals, including two from junior forward Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>The reigning Big West Offensive Player of the Year found an equalizer in the 38th minute, scoring off an assist from freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong for the second straight week. After receiving a ball from DePuy down the left wing, Acheampong sent it right back to DePuy through the air, and was able to beat his defender and knock a header off the near post and in.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the half tied 1-1, UCSB took complete control from there, scoring three goals in less than 10 minutes. Sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani gave the Gauchos the lead in the 54th minute, firing it in from the top of the box to make it 2-1.</p>\n<p>Just two and a half minutes later, DePuy scored another header off a corner kick from junior midfielder Josue España, giving him his sixth goal of the season. Soon after, DePuy returned the favor, forcing a turnover on the UCLA half before setting up España for his first goal as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>The Bruins were able to pick up another goal with sophomore forward Seyi Adekoya scoring in garbage time, but they fell well short of mounting a full comeback.</p>\n<p>UCSB had struggled to finish its chances in its last game against the College of Charleston, only scoring three times off a season-high 21 shots. The Gauchos were much more efficient finishing this time around, converting on half of their eight shots on goal to pick up their season-best mark of four goals. It was the first time the Bruins conceded four goals in a regular season game since 2010.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg improved his starting record to 4-2, tying a career high with four saves on the night.</p>\n<p>The secret to Santa Barbara’s success is no secret at this point. DePuy has a Big West-leading six goals through seven games. Dating back to last season, he has been on an incredible scoring run, tallying 11 scores in his last 13 appearances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to put forth arguably their best effort of the season despite missing injured juniors Drew Murphy and Ismaila Jome, the only two Gauchos on the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team other than DePuy.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is Akron, which enters this weekend boasting a No. 9 national ranking and a record of 4-2-1. The Zips got off to a great start to their season that included back-to-back road wins over No. 25 Georgetown and No. 11 Maryland. Unlike the Gauchos, they have experienced success away from home this season, going 3-1 on the road.</p>\n<p>Powering Akron on the offensive side this season has been redshirt sophomore Sam Gainford and junior midfielder Adam Najem. Both players lead the team with four goals and three assists each and will look to break down a UCSB defense that has conceded just one goal at home this season.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos will face San Diego. The Toreros are currently 4-2-2 after winning 3-1 at Cal State Fullerton and 2-0 against San Jose State last weekend. Senior midfielder Marvin Schmiege has been their key man through eight games, either leading or tying for first on the team in nearly every important offensive category with three goals, two assists, 21 shots and eight shots on goal.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts Akron this Friday at 7:30 p.m. and San Diego on Sunday at 6:00 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page

The rush of emotions that occur while watching an underdog triumphantly upset a top team is always an achievement that is remembered.</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 11, 2013 is a date in UCSB women’s volleyball history that remains relevant. In her first year as Gaucho Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch helped lead Santa Barbara to a 3-2 upset victory over No. 5 Hawaii. This Friday is a pivotal opportunity for UCSB to recreate history in its Big West conference season opener against No. 11 Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the challenge, and obviously we need to progress this week in practice. We definitely need to get our confidence at a stronger, stable point to go into their place,” Lantagne Welch said. “There’s some eerily similar things to two years ago. We were struggling in the pre-conference and not doing so great, and we went over to the islands and upset them. We know that you gotta get out there and play the game and we’re excited to do that and it’s a great opportunity for us.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara enters Stan Sheriff Center with a 4-7 overall record, and is set to face a Hawaii team that is in full stride and on pace for a special season. The Gauchos certainly have a challenging task ahead of them as they are 0-2 versus Top 25 opponents this season. The Rainbow Wahine are currently 10-1 overall, and are hoping to extend their five-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB comes into its conference opener with a chip on its shoulder as it has yet to end its disheartening losing stretch of six games. Overcoming this frustrating streak will be no easy task as the Gauchos prepare to face one of the nation’s best players in Nikki Taylor.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine’s junior opposite is having a captivating year in which she has earned an array of awards and accolades at the season’s midpoint. Through just 11 matches, she is now Hawaii’s record setter for most Big West Player of the Week Awards after earning three straight, was rewarded Sports Imports/AVCA Division I National Player of the Week honors and became the first player in Rainbow Wahine history to receive the espnW National Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>While Taylor is having a standout year, Hawaii as a collective group has played spectacularly on the court. The Rainbow Wahine are flourishing in making their case as the Big West’s top team as they lead six of the conference’s seven statistical categories.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to spoil Hawaii’s winning record, the Gauchos’ must maintain a consistent balance on both sides of the ball. They rank second in the conference in service aces per set at 1.41, are tied for first in solo blocks with 24, third with an average of 2.32 blocks per set and are second in the league with the least amount of errors at 198.</p>\n<p>As long as Santa Barbara does not allow Hawaii to force it into playing against their strengths, the chances of UCSB upsetting the Rainbow Wahine become more realistic. The beginning of conference play presents the Gauchos with a great opportunity to disregard their early-season stumble with hopes of improvement.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a couple of rough games, but now with starting conference we get to travel to Hawaii and play a really great team. I think it’s a great time to show what we’ve got and have a new fresh start,” sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman said. “We have to go into practice with the mentality that we’re going to get better every day because you can’t just keep saying it or you’ll never improve.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s conference season-opener against No. 11 Hawaii will take place on the road this Friday, Sept. 25th at 10 p.m. PT, 7 p.m. HST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of September 24, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64793\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64793\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/","id":5317,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5316,5315,5314],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Round Up: Week 2 Review","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/romo-collarbone-355x230.jpe","mobile_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/romo-collarbone.jpe","description":"Sports Editor Sean White contributes his thoughts on Week 2 of the 2015 NFL season to the Nexus Sports Online Focus.

Manning is now 14-1 in his career against KC, and joined Hall of Famer Brett Favre as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to throw for more than 70,000 career passing yards. It was an exceptional night from Peyton as he completed 26 of 45 pass attempts, threw for 256 yards, 3 touchdowns, and one pick. However, while Peyton had a milestone night, the Broncos’ defense carried Denver to its victory as they forced three fumbles and had one interception. As if running backs couldn’t receive any more scrutiny after what took place in Seattle and the Meadowlands in Week 1, the shenanigans continued with the Chiefs’ Jamaal Charles. Despite gaining 21 rushing attempts, 125 yards, and one TD, Charles fumbled twice. As we all expected OT, Charles’ hands thought otherwise as he coughed it up with 36 seconds left in regulation which led to the go-ahead scoop and score for the Broncos’ 31-24 win. Sorry Chiefs’ fans, but beating Peyton just might not be meant to be.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Mr. Brady definitely took note of that as he torched Buffalo throwing for 466 yards and three TD’s, the most passing yards allowed in a single-game in Bills history, to lead his team to its 40-32 victory. Apparently the Bills’ needed “King Kong” like Ryan mentioned because the Patriots’ clinic didn’t stop there as “Gronkmania” (yes I just made that up), could not be stopped. Gronkowski had seven receptions to go along with 113 yards and a touchdown. It was a great comeback effort by the Bills, but when your quarterback throws three interceptions against a team, who in my opinion has the best QB in the league, chances are you are going to lose. It’s quite simple: Turnovers = more time for Brady on the field = TD’s for Brady and the Pats.</p>\n<p><strong>Cowboys’ Win, but lose Romo</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"489146748\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/cowboys/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=2000%2C1903&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1903\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cowboys\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=888%2C845&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64678 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=158%2C150\" alt=\"Cowboys\" width=\"158\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=1024%2C974&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Entering this season, many had Head Coach Chip Kelly and the Philadelphia Eagles as the favorites to win the NFC East. But with the Eagles’ sitting at 0-2 after a 20-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, it leaves the door wide open for a 2-0 Dallas team that is eagerly hoping to make a deeper playoff run after nearly making the NFC Championship game last year. It was a fundamental win for the Cowboys as they dominated the time of possession battle, having the ball for 40:30 in comparison to the Eagles’ insufficient time of 19:30. As if things couldn’t get any worse for the Cowboys’ after losing Dez Bryant to a broken foot, the injury troubles continue as quarterback Tony Romo suffered a fractured left collarbone in the third quarter of Sunday’s game. It’s fortunate that Romo doesn’t need surgery to heal the break, but the Cowboys’ Super Bowl chances are definitely slimmer with his absence as he is expected to miss the next eight weeks. Don’t count them out though as Brandon Weeden went seven for seven for 73 yards and a TD, then again, the Cowboys’ did already have a 13-3 lead so we’ll just have to wait and see what he can do in a game’s entirety.</p>\n<p><strong>Winston wins in the Bayou</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1849514025\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64765\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/bucs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bucs\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64765 alignright\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=170%2C170\" alt=\"bucs\" width=\"170\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Despite a horrendous debut versus the Tennessee Titans in Week 1, No. 1 draft pick Jameis Winston redeemed himself on the road against the New Orleans Saints, helping lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to their 26-19 win, and earning his first career victory.

It seems like he may have found his favorite receiving target in Travis Benjamin, who had three receptions for 115 yards and two TD’s.

As usual, Aaron Rodgers came ready to play as he connected on 25 of his 33 pass attempts for 249 yards and two TD’s to guide the Pack to its 27-17 win. Reaping the benefits of Rodgers performance was the multi-talented Randall Cobb, who snagged eight receptions for 116 yards. The “bad blood” between these two teams became a bit more vicious as Rodgers would go on and mock Russell Wilson in his postgame interview.

With the offseason acquisitions of Frank Gore, Andre Johnson, and more, it’s surprising to see the team that many predicted to play in Santa Clara next February off to another slow start. Unfortunately for Indianapolis, Andrew Luck has yet to play like the “elite” QB he’s labeled to be. He was responsible for four of the team’s five turnovers as he threw three interceptions and lost one fumble. But, recognition must be given to the New York Jets’ defense as it shutout the Colts’ in the first half, and currently lead the NFL in takeaways with 10.  The Jets’ receiving duo of Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker flamed the Colts’ secondary for a combined total of 15 receptions, 198 yards, and two touchdowns. Of course the blame can’t only be n Luck, especially after a costly fumble by Gore at the two-yard line and Indianapolis’ inconsistent play on defense, but as the leader of this franchise Luck must improve his performance on the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

It’s a grind and in each game you just have to keep getting better.”</p>\n<p>The win on Friday improves the Gauchos’ record to 3-2-1 overall, while Charleston falls to an identical mark of 3-2-1.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long to get the action started, as UCSB forward Ahinga Selemani was aggressive early. After the sophomore transfer earned a corner just under six minutes in, junior midfielder Josue Espana set up Sam Strong for his first career NCAA goal. Espana’s corner sailed over a wave of players at the near post before falling perfectly to the freshman defender inside the six-yard box for an easy header, putting UCSB up 1-0.</p>\n<p>It took only 85 seconds for the Cougars to answer back. Junior midfielder Eric Clark’s free kick found sophomore defender Cesar Murillo to tie it at 1-1, marking the first time the Gauchos have conceded a first half goal this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to eliminate making that one big mistake,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re playing with a young back line and I still feel like our communication, our spacing, we’re still prone to make a mistake going up for the same ball, so we just have to keep working on that.”</p>\n<p>After junior left back Ismaila Jome left the game with an ankle injury about 15 minutes in, freshman midfielder Geoffrey Acheampong filled in and was a menace on the offensive side. The former Cate School star led the way with two assists, his first coming with just over 26 minutes left in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We got some good performances from some different players. In particular, I thought [Geoffrey] played his best college game,” Vom Steeg said. “We were planning to bring Geoffrey into [Jome’s] position anyway, but there was no need to actually bring Ish back into that game the way that Geoffrey was playing.”</p>\n<p>With his third corner attempt in under a minute, Acheampong played a ball into a packed six-yard box where junior forward Nick DePuy was able to establish position over his defender and place a header just inside the far post, giving his team a 2-1 lead heading into the half. Santa Barbara has now scored first in each of its six games and taken a lead into halftime in all but one.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s goal was his fourth of the season, tied for first in the Big West, and the eighth game-winner of his career. In the 12 games that DePuy has scored, the Gauchos have gone an undefeated 9-0-3.</p>\n<p>With just under 22 minutes to go in the game, Acheampong played in a low cross that found junior midfielder Andy Perez at the far post where he was able to power a deflected shot in off a defender to seal the 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>“I just saw two guys trying to crash the box and my job was just to get it into the six,” Acheampong said. “It’s kind of a gray area there where the keeper doesn’t really know to stay or come out, so I just put it in between for Nick or Andy to crash it and it just landed at Andy’s foot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB found itself threatening early and often, outshooting Charleston 21-4 on the night. Goalkeeper Kevin Shields was the easy choice for man of the match for the visiting side, as the junior made nine saves to keep the score line respectable.</p>\n<p>“I did feel like our offense really started to come alive today,” Vom Steeg said. “We really wore that team down, so our energy and our running was good.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, it wasn’t all smiles for the Gauchos. Already missing junior midfielder Drew Murphy to an ankle injury, UCSB now might also be without its starting left back Jome as well against UCLA after he suffered an apparent sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>The game was also delayed for an extended period of time in the first half when Charleston’s Eric Clark needed to be carted off after taking a hard fall while challenging for a header.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now shift their attention to tonight, where they will face a hostile Bruin crowd in a Pac-12 televised game. UCSB most recently fell to UCLA at Harder Stadium 1-0 last season and has not defeated its UC counterpart since 2011, going 0-3-1 since that last win.</p>\n<p>The Bruins enter with a 2-3 record this season, most recently ousting Big West opponent Cal Poly 4-1 on Friday. UCLA’s youth has powered it so far this season with seven of its eight goals coming from its underclassmen. Freshman midfielder Jackson Yueill and sophomore forward Seyi Adekoyi lead the way with two goals each.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is set to kickoff at 7:00 p.m. at Drake Stadium and will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/","id":1498,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1497,1496,1495],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":98,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
