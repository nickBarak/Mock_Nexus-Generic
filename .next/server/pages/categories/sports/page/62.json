On the last day of competition, Texas Tech swept No. 20 Kentucky in six straight sets in singles play.</p>\n<p>Texas Tech has two players ranked in singles play with No. 26 junior Gabriela Talaba and No. 81 sophomore Felicity Maltby and a strong overall team performance against a talented Kentucky squad proves that the Lady Raiders will be yet another powerful test for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>However, Texas Tech lost in overall doubles play to Kentucky, only winning one out of three matches. It was the No. 14 ranked pair in the country junior Sarah Dvorak and junior Sabrina Federici who picked up the lone doubles win for Texas Tech.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also be playing either Arizona State or South Carolina the following day. Arizona State is ranked No. 22 in the country and was victorious in their season opener against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>ASU is currently 1-0 on the new season and has two players in the ITA Singles rankings with No. 49 sophomore Sammi Hampton and No. 63 senior Kassidy Jump. In the doubles rankings, Arizona State has No. 36 ranked pair in freshman Savannah Slaysman and junior Kelley Anderson.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils were also strong in singles play as they swept UC Davis with five out of six matches ending in straight sets. Arizona State was also formidable in doubles play as they won both of the games that were finished to completion with the third match being abandoned.</p>\n<p>South Carolina looks to be an extremely talented team with its perfect 3-0 record and the fact that they have six players in the top 125 ITA Singles Rankings and the No. 39 ranked pair in junior Hadley Berg and sophomore Paige Cline.</p>\n<p>The team is coming off of a dominating performance which saw them sweep both North Florida and Florida A&amp;M in singles and doubles play. The Gamecocks’ performance in the doubleheader last weekend is a strong indicator of the challenge that they could provide to a talented Gauchos squad should they play each other this Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are looking to improve in their singles play performance where they were within one point of tying with USC. Texas Tech, Arizona State, and South Carolina are all extremely talented in singles play and it will be up to the Gauchos to outplay their opponents.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are strong in doubles play this year with two standout pairs in Dubavets/Storjic and senior Melissa Baker/sophomore Stephanie Yamada. Dubavets and Storjic were victorious in last weekend’s match and Baker and Yamada are ranked No. 33 in the country currently. The talented pairs the Gauchos have matched up well against the slew of teams who will look to continue their previous success in doubles play this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Texas Tech at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 28, at the McLeod Tennis Center and Arizona State/South Carolina on Sunday, Jan. 29, at 3 p.m. at the same location.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75228\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-tennis-prepares-for-back-to-back-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75228\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-tennis-prepares-for-back-to-back-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-tennis-prepares-for-back-to-back-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-tennis-prepares-for-back-to-back-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-tennis-prepares-for-back-to-back-weekend-matches/","id":67,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[66,65,64],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Thriving Gauchos Travel to Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB swim team will look to continue its winning ways against rival Cal Poly when its rivalry is rekindled again this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The men and women’s swim teams are currently on fire.

Dating back to the 2011-12 season, the Gauchos have notoriously been outstanding when they have matched up against the Cal Poly swim teams.</p>\n<p>The men’s team has won nine straight matches against the Mustangs, and this includes the win earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the women have almost been equally as dominant, winning their last five matches against the Mustangs dating back to the 2013-14.</p>\n<p>UCSB should feel confident, but not cocky. This is a prime opportunity to continue the hot streak and continue their success against a rival opponent. They should have no problem against the Mustangs as they are in a down year; however, this is easier said than done, and it should be a matchup to watch.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Cal Poly this Saturday, Jan. 28 at 11 a.m. in beautiful San Luis Obispo, Calif.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75231\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75231\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/","id":1791,"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava"},"related":[1790,1789,1788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Streak Ends, Faces UC Irvine Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-26-at-12.49.49-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-26-at-12.49.49-PM.png?resize=795%2C402&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team was unable to preserve its four-game winning streak, losing in its first game back on the road at Cal State Northridge.

Porter currently leads the Gauchos in scoring during conference play with 13.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also unable to contain the Matadors’ rhythmic shooting night. CSUN benefited from its backcourt players in both its starting lineup and bench rotation.</p>\n<p>After scoring a career-high 25 points last Saturday versus Cal Poly, redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe surpassed her career-best total with 28 points in the Matadors’ win over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Combining with Maulupe for 49 of CSUN’s conference game best 75 points was sophomore guard Cheyenne Allen with a career-high 21 points on 6-for-9 shooting from the field and an 8-for-9 finish at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Overall, CSUN shot 48.2 percent from the field and 40 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>In addition to Maulupe and Allen, helping create the Matadors’ hot shooting was their rebounding.</p>\n<p>They outrebounded UCSB 47-27 as freshman forward Eliza Matthews had a game-high 12 rebounds and sophomore center Channon Fluker had 11.</p>\n<p>UCSB will wrap up its pair of away games for the week against UC Irvine this Saturday. Prior to facing Santa Barbara, the Anteaters will play Hawaii tonight at 9 p.m. PST. They will enter the Stan Sheriff Center at 3-16 and 1-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Various pieces have contributed to the Gauchos’ upgrade in play since the start of Big West play. A central piece has been the productivity of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman.</p>\n<p>In just her first season as a Gaucho, she has already solidified her role in the paint.<br>\nQuick enough to use her pivot foot and strong enough to post up and drive on a defender,</p>\n<p>Edelman has been nearly unstoppable as she holds the Big West lead in field goal percentage at 56 percent.</p>\n<p>Prior to scoring her lowest point total in a conference game with three on Wednesday, Edelman had posted double figures in four straight games.</p>\n<p>Despite grabbing a team-high 10 rebounds, Edelman’s offensive production was missed, as UCSB is 8-3 when she manages to score in double figures.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s women’s basketball program is in rebuilding condition after its decline in recent years.</p>\n<p>En route to its third-straight losing season, the Anteaters have not had a winning season since their 2013-14 run. In the past two seasons, UCI had a combined 12-51 record.</p>\n<p>The downward spiral led to the hiring of first-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue during the offseason last April.</p>\n<p>Despite losing just one senior from last season, UC Irvine has a multitude of players that lack in-game experience. All five of the team’s current seniors had never started a full season entering this year.</p>\n<p>In addition to the hiring of a new coach, the Anteaters are still dealing with the lingering effects of the early departure of their most impactful player last season in former forward Mokun Fajemisin.</p>\n<p>On a team that had no double-figure scorer, Fajemisin managed to lead UCI in scoring with<br>\n9.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Yet it was her defensive and rebounding abilities that were most pivotal. She led the Big West in blocks per game with a 2.0 average and ranked fifth in the Big West with 7.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>She was the conference’s ultimate rim protector as she ended last season with a conference-leading 54 blocks.</p>\n<p>Despite boasting an arsenal of three double-figure scorers — senior forward Shereen Sutherland, sophomore guard Andee Ritter and junior forward Sabrina Engelstad — UCI has had ongoing issues with both scoring and defending the ball.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are the Big West’s worst scoring defense, as they allow 72.2 points per game and are second-worst on offense with an average of 58.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB remains one of the conference’s top teams in terms of scoring the ball and playing three-point defense, ranking second by allowing just 63.7 points per game and third as it holds opponents to an average 29.2 percentage thus far.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Anteaters will tip-off this Saturday, Jan. 28, at 2 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":yu\" class=\"ajR\"

Ariz. to participate in the Arizona State Invitational against two top-25 nationally ranked teams for its first road test of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face No. 21 Wagner and the invite’s host in No. 5 Arizona State this weekend. Both opponents will be playing in season-opening matches, and the Gauchos can only hope their heavy slate to begin the year will be to their advantage despite a short time span for recovery.</p>\n<p>“I knew that six games in three days were a lot to ask for the team to compete at such a high level at the very beginning of the season. It was intended to be that way,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday will commence the Arizona State Invitational for UCSB when it faces Wagner. Notably, both programs have been on an upward trend in recent years.</p>\n<p>However, just like UCSB, Wagner lost some key players who contributed to all of its winnings in recent years. Three of their top five goal scorers in program history graduated last spring. That record-setting core of players led the team to three straight MAAC Tournament Championships.</p>\n<p>Even with the departure of several players, the Seahawks are still not as young as the Gauchos, who consist of eight freshmen and one transfer.</p>\n<p>“Fifty percent of our team is new, but it’s the beginning of the season,” Kay said. “The positive thing is that I think we will be competitive against anybody, so I’m excited about that.”</p>\n<p>Both teams are still trying to find the right mixture of players and play styles. However, UCSB has a slight edge with the momentum it gained from its four victories.</p>\n<p>Wagner is led by three juniors — attacker Elise Begg, utility Kimberly Watson and attacker Lacey Anderson — who all contributed over 55 goals a season ago, ranking them just behind the former three-headed scoring core of seniors who shattered various records.</p>\n<p>Wagner and UCSB have only faced off twice in the past; both meetings were in the last two years. The Gauchos won both games by the scores of 10-6 and 5-3.</p>\n<p>Sunday will provide a tougher matchup versus Arizona State. Scoring against the Sun Devils’ defense will be no easy task as the unit is led by star redshirt junior Mia Rycraw inside the goal cage.</p>\n<p>Rycraw finished last season as a Second-Team All-American goalie with 318 saves, which was first in the conference and third in Arizona State single-season history.</p>\n<p>She is joined by a terrific sophomore attacker from Assendelft, Netherlands, Maud Koopman. Koopman led the Sun Devils in points last season as a freshman with 35 goals.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils have been living in the shadows of MPSF powerhouses USC, Stanford, and UCLA, who routinely compete for National Championships. The current polls have Arizona State only behind Cal, UCLA, USC and Stanford, who are all in the MPSF conference.</p>\n<p>Arizona State finished the 2016 season with a 10-1 home record. UCSB was just 1-4 on the road last year.</p>\n<p>ASU has beaten UCSB once in each of the last five seasons by an average margin of victory of nearly four goals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will once again see where they’re at after the two games this weekend. For now, this team is still trying to figure some things out.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t played anybody else besides ourselves before [last] weekend,” Kay said. “Playing other teams really shows what we need to work on and also what we’re good at. I’m looking forward to getting back to work this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Wagner at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 28 and Arizona State at 1 p.m. the following day, Jan. 29.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/","id":4924,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4923,4922,4921],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seeking First Road Win of the Season at Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-27-at-12.01.54-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-27-at-12.01.54-PM.png?resize=644%2C471&ssl=1","description":"The struggling UCSB men's basketball team hopes to get back on the winning side of things as it travels to Hawaii to face the Rainbow Warriors on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Unsuccessful in achieving a win on the road this season, the UCSB men’s basketball team will look to turn around its fortune this Saturday as it takes on Hawaii in its seventh conference game of the year.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara goes into beautiful Honolulu with a deflating 3-15 overall record as well as a 1-5 Big West record.

The loss marked the ninth time this season that they lost by double figures, and the sixth time this season they were held to 60 points or less in a game.</p>\n<p>If Santa Barbara hopes to come back from Hawaii with a win under its belt, then it will need to improve upon its league-worst points per game (63.5), shooting percentage (36.8), three-point percentage (26.1) and free throw percentage (65.1).</p>\n<p>Since conference play has started, UCSB has been even worse in every single one of those categories besides free throw percentage and ranks dead last in PPG (59.2), shooting percentage (36.1) and three-point percentage (24.3). In fact, the Gauchos three-point percentage ranks dead last in the entire NCAA DI Basketball once you factor in their poor 5-21 shooting against CSUN yesterday.</p>\n<p>One thing UCSB has been able to count on this season is low turnover numbers. Santa Barbara ranks second in turnovers per game with a low 11.9. It has also been solid on the glass as it ranks second in the Big West in rebounds per game grabbing 39.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Considering that the Gauchos are down two big men in sophomore forward Ami Lakoju and junior forward Jalen Canty, the fact that the rebounding numbers have been able to stay up is a testament to how hard the team plays every night.</p>\n<p>However, playing hard simply is not enough, and if UCSB wants to start winning these conference games and make a run at the Big West tournament, it will need to start making shots.</p>\n<p>One athlete who is certainly gifted at scoring is guard Gabe Vincent. The former Big West Freshman of the Year is third in the Big West in points per game, averaging 15.4.</p>\n<p>The junior had a great first half last night against CSUN, going off for 16 points on a very efficient 6-12 shooting, 4-6 from beyond the arc. Unfortunately for Vincent, fatigue and the Matadors defense seemed to catch up to him as he went scoreless in the second half on 0-7 shooting from the field and 0-4 from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Someone will definitely need to help Vincent on the scoring end if the Gauchos want a happy result on Saturday, and besides relying on senior Eric Childress, they will also need great performances from two big freshmen in Clifton Powell Jr. and Max Heidegger. As the stats suggest, when Vincent and Childress get help from the young athletes, Santa Barbara’s chances of winning go way up.</p>\n<p>Powell is a spark plug for the UCSB offense, and when he is running and scoring, the team certainly feels like it is flowing a lot better. The guard was a big factor in Santa Barbara’s 58-53 win over Cal Poly as he went off for a career-high 13 points and scored on two clutch threes.</p>\n<p>Heidegger is another guard who has also been a bit inconsistent but has shown flashes of brilliance. The freshman was the second-leading scorer last night for the Gauchos with 12 points and averages 7.6 PPG, which is the fourth-best on the team. His career high of 21 points came on UCSB’s huge comeback victory over CSUB back on Dec. 27, and he followed that game up with a 17-point night versus Seattle.</p>\n<p>Desperation time is now for the Gauchos. With only a one game lead on the eighth spot and the last spot for the conference tournament in March, they need to start racking up some wins to keep the Mustangs away. Despite the awful start to the season, getting to the Big West tournament should be the No. 1 priority for the Gauchos, and who knows, maybe when that time comes, they will be able to make a run.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against Hawaii in a Big West match at 8 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 28 at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 27, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>At the 10-minute mark, halfway through the first half, the score was low, Gauchos leading 15-13. No. 8 UCSB was putting up a formidable fight against No. 4 CSUN. The two teams crawled up the board basket by basket as both forced turnovers and tried to profit from them.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman center Tyler Jackson entered the game at 9:56 in his second-ever court appearance. Within 50 seconds he made a sweet steal, an offensive rebound, and 2-2 foul shots. With UCSB’s usual big players still out, Jackson has had large shoes to fill on the court.</p>\n<p>At 8:38 CSUN redshirt junior guard Darin Johnson made a steal and had a fast break down the court, but he was no match for UCSB senior guard Eric Childress, who took the ball right out of Johnson’s hands, turned around and made a layup, sending Gaucho fans to their feet.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, one of CSUN’s most valued players — redshirt junior guard Kendall Smith — was not making as many moves as expected. Averaging 16.5 points per game in the regular season, he only scored one basket the entire first half.</p>\n<p>On the other half of the court, team leader junior guard Gabe Vincent was on fire, going 4-6 in three-pointers. Dominating the court on defense as well as offense, he managed to put 16 on the board before the half ended and was able to tap into energy the Gauchos so desperately needed.</p>\n<p>This was a historic night for Vincent as well as UCSB basketball. With 4:11 left in the first half, Vincent made his 183rd career three-pointer, passing Gaucho legend Orlando Johnson and becoming number nine on the UCSB all-time top 10 list of three-pointers made. He went on to finish the game with a total of 185 completed threes.</p>\n<p>As the half went on the Gauchos seemed as though they knew what they wanted to do, but just could not get the shot off. Lots of time was spent handing off around the three-point line with few drives, but UCSB held its ground.</p>\n<p>After such an evenly matched half, the last two minutes were startling as the Matadors found their stride. Scoring seven points in one minute, the Matadors flipped a switch and were able to run all over the Gauchos without resistance.</p>\n<p>Aside from two more three-pointers made by Vincent, the Matadors increased their score by 13 points in just over three minutes, leaving a shocking halftime score of 36-32.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the first half, CSUN came out of the gates guns blazing as the second period started. For every shot a Gaucho took, the Matadors took two. All players were playing with heart, but the Matadors were simply moving faster and shooting more accurately.</p>\n<p>With Childress and Vincent missing shot after shot, it was clear the Gauchos had lost their groove and were struggling to pick their heads up. After Vincent’s brilliant first-half performance, going 0-7 in field goals made for a disappointing second half.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman guard Max Heidegger was a firecracker with impressive ball handling, hard drives and risky but successful shots. He especially shone in the second half when Childress and Vincent seemed burned out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Starting around the 13th minute with a three-pointer from junior guard Michael Warren, the Matadors were able to keep a steady 10-or-more-point lead for the rest of the game. Based on of the level of competition in this first half, this surge from CSUN surprised and devastated Gaucho fans.</p>\n<p>As the second half dragged on and players on both sides of the court continued to get more and more frustrated, the roughness of play also increased. Although CSUN players were on the floor multiple times in the first half, many Gauchos joined them in the second half. They finished the game with 17 Matador fouls and 20 Gaucho fouls.</p>\n<p>To top it all off, both Lubin and Smith dunked in the last five minutes of the game, only furthering the frustration of the home team. Lately the Gauchos have not been able to keep up the energy and precision of play as games wind to an end, a flaw that was unfortunately on display in this most recent game.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Although it was another conference loss piling onto the disappointment of losing at home, the first half of the UCSB-CSUN game gave Gaucho fans hope. The men’s team will have the opportunity to win their first game away when they challenge No. 7 University of Hawaii.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/","id":283,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[282,281,280],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Carries Momentum On The Road At CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-19-17_2-web-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-19-17_2-web-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will attempt to extend its four-game winning streak on the road at CSUN.

Sitting at 8-11 and 1-4 in conference play, the Matadors’ matchup versus UCSB will be the second of their four game home stand.</p>\n<p>There is a current total of three Gauchos that average 10 points per game. One of them is redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, who serves as the team’s focal point in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>Leading the Big West in field goal percentage with a 57.6 overall average, and has been even more efficient during UCSB’s conference schedule, making a huge improvement to 65.1 percent. Helping create high percentage shots has been her ability to rebound the ball as well. During conference play, she is tied for third in rebounds per game at 8.4.</p>\n<p>Edelman has increased her endurance to be able to produce when called upon, ranking second in minutes per game with a 37.4 average during the conference slate.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s post player is coming off her highest point total in a conference game thus far of 19 points. Over the course of both the non-conference and conference schedules combined, Edelman leads the team in games with at least 10 points at 11.</p>\n<p>It can be expected that Edelman will face one of her toughest matchups in the paint this Wednesday as she will battle it out with sophomore center Channon Fluker.</p>\n<p>After an exceptional freshman season, in which she was named the Big West Freshman of the Year and became the first rookie to be a First Team All-Big West selection since 2002, Fluker remains within the top ranks of post players in the conference.</p>\n<p>Averaging 15.2 points and 10 rebounds per game, Fluker is currently the only player in the Big West to average a double-double in any statistical category. Her rebounds per game average ranks 31<sup>st</sup> in the nation. Her 206 total rebounds is the most in league play so far this season and has helped the Matadors gain their conference leading average of 42.6 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>She is a proven rim protector, owning a conference leading 2.2 blocks per game average. Her current total of 42 blocks, which leads all Big West players, has already surpassed her total of 35 in her first year.</p>\n<p>Although CSUN was swept in both of its games against the Gauchos last season, Fluker made her presence felt in game two of the series with a 31-point performance.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the Matadors’ gameplan revolves around Fluker, so the Gauchos will look to contain her presence in the interior, but still must remain aware of the three-point shooting of redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe. Maulupe’s 40.5 three-point percentage ranks sixth in the Big West, while 47 three-point makes is second.</p>\n<p>Thus far, UCSB has been consistent with its perimeter defense, ranking third overall in three-point defense at 28.7 percent.

But judging by the current conference standings, CSUN’s team is going to be a tougher challenge.</p>\n<p>Since the start of Big West play, senior guard Kendall Smith is the conference’s leading scorer, averaging 19 points per game. Overall, he ranks second with a 16.5 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Following closely behind his fellow starter in PPG average is junior forward Tavrion Dawson at 14.1 per contest. The 6’8” power player scored 14 points on UCSB last year and is currently the top rebounder on the team, averaging 5.8 boards per game and grabbed a career-high of 14 boards against the University of Bethesda this season.</p>\n<p>A well-rounded player from the CSUN bench to watch for is redshirt sophomore forward Rakim Lubin. He averages 5.5 rebounds per game, just behind Dawson’s 5.8 average, and has a field goal percentage of .533. In each of his last two games he has fouled out after getting the maximum five fouls, but he has still managed to score 13 of the 29 bench points against the number one team in the Big West, UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The Matadors will not be an easy matchup for the Gauchos, especially since the CSUN field goal and three point field goal percentages are both respectively over nine percent better than those of UCSB. Finishing plays to completion has been one problem for the Gauchos this year that has yet to be fully resolved.</p>\n<p>Although junior forward Jalen Canty and sophomore forward Ami Lakoju remain unable to play, it seems that the Gauchos have found a solid starting line-up.</p>\n<p>In their most recent game, junior guard Gabe Vincent was able to score 18 points alongside junior forward Alex Hart’s 10; unfortunately, the Gauchos’ shooting ability was no match for UC Riverside’s starting lineup. With four out of five starters scoring in double figures, UCSB could not keep up.</p>\n<p>Alongside Vincent and Hart, senior guard Eric Childress, sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak and freshman guard Clifton Powell have started off the last four games and have been able to effectively keep opposing teams’ scores low.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore center Tyler Jackson has made his first appearance in a UCSB game this past weekend. Jackson redshirted his first year and has been unable to play this season due to an injury, but he definitely made waves in his 11 minutes of playing time on Saturday. Standing at 7’2”, his height is necessary under the basket since two Gaucho bigs are not currently able to play.</p>\n<p>Although it may seem late in the season, the Gauchos are slowly finding their rhythm. In their most recent game every player — starting and from the bench — put points on the board except for one. A younger team with a new playing style is no easy feat for Head Coach Bob Williams, and the team’s skills will be put to the test again as they face the Matadors.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hosts Cal State Northridge in a conference match at 7 p.m. tonight, Jan. 25, at the Thunderdome.

Another stupendous contributor for the Gauchos was freshman Heaven Quintana, who was blazing fast, and put up times many swimmers would be envious of. She put up times of 29.05 in the 50 yard breaststroke, 1:02.17 in the 100 yard breaststroke, and 2:18.85 in the 200 yard breaststroke.</p>\n<p>The whole team thrived off of the energy of these young swimmers, and the team ultimately wound up with a first place team victory that was no doubt a collective team effort.</p>\n<p>Headlining the competition with two victories, the Gaucho men’s team handled the competition. They were able to capture a win over UNLV, and they seemed to do it with ease with a lopsided score of 173 to 120.</p>\n<p>Against the Air Force Academy, this match proved to be much more difficult. With the Gauchos staring adversity in the face, down 32 points, they somehow, someway willed themselves back for a comeback that many did not see coming.</p>\n<p>The men were able to use grit and determination, backed by some clutch performances, to narrowly snatch the win right out from under  the Air Force Academy’s nose. This gutsy performance led to a final victory with a score of 148-146, with the Gauchos finding satisfaction in ruining perfection with the Air Force suffering its first loss and snapping the Academy’s undefeated season.</p>\n<p>This was only half of the competition, and while the men were enjoying this outstanding weekend, the women weren’t too shabby themselves. They were able to showcase their youth and athleticism with many young Gauchos showing that they are going to be a force to be reckoned with going forward.</p>\n<p>The women were able to seal the deal with a final score of 159.5-126.5, and were able to truly bounce back after a week against Pacific in which they suffered their first loss of the season.</p>\n<p>The men and women are hoping to use these victories to fuel them in what is definitely going to be a tough week in front of them. The Gauchos take on longtime fierce rival Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo this Saturday, Jan. 28th at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/","id":1787,"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava"},"related":[1786,1785,1784],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Loses Versus No. 18 USC To Start Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In their first match of the regular season, the UCSB women’s tennis team lost to No. 18 USC 5-2.

Freshman Trojan Kulikov defeated Baker, who was previously victorious in doubles play, at a score of 6-0, 7-6(4).</p>\n<p>At the halfway point in singles play the Trojans had a 2-1 lead against the Gauchos, leaving UCSB trying to get the lead back.</p>\n<p>Silveira beat USC’s Valdes 7-6(1), 7-6(4), leaving the point total all knotted up at 2-2 with only two games left in the meet.</p>\n<p>However, it was only Dubavets and Da Silveira who would come away with victories in singles play for the Gauchos, as USC made record wins in the remaining final two matches.</p>\n<p>Yamada lost in her match against the Women of Troy’s Sydney Van Alphen, posting a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 record in her sets. Westby defeated UCSB junior Amanda Atanasson 6-7, 6-4, 7-5.</p>\n<p>The Trojans came away with the victory in both singles and doubles play, winning with an overall score of 5-2, a worse result for UCSB compared to their matchup against USC last year that resulted in a 4-3 loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had some promising results in a match against a powerful USC team. The win in doubles play from Dubavets and Stojic as well as the singles victory from Dubavets and Da Silveira were good records despite the disappointing overall result.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to rebound from this loss next week as they travel down south to Texas to play Texas Tech in their second game on Jan. 28 at 3 p.m. PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/","id":64,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[63,62,61],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Winter Invite 4-2, Fall to Juggernauts No. 2 USC & No. 8 Michigan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opening this season at home at Campus Pool hosting the UCSB Winter Invitational, the No. 9 UCSB women's water polo team concluded the weekend with a solid first impression despite two losses.

The first half ended with UCSB on top 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put on a beautiful display of attacking in the third quarter. They outscored Cal Baptist 6-2 in the period to give them what appeared to be a comfortable 10-5 lead heading into the fourth.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist exploded with three goals in the first three minutes of the final quarter. However, freshman utility Sarah Snyder responded by netting her third and fourth goals of the game for the Gauchos. UCSB earned their first win of the season in their Winter Invitational debut 13-8.</p>\n<p>Later that Friday afternoon, UCSB went up against Indiana in a top-15 battle. UCSB was first on the board thanks to senior captain Taylor Shore. Moments later, Snyder scored her fifth total goal of the day. Indiana returned the favor with two goals of their own to end the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>The second quarter passed in the same fashion as the Gauchos scored the first two goals before the Hoosiers answered with a pair of goals to tie it up.</p>\n<p>That was the last of Indiana’s scoring for the game, because UCSB didn’t concede a goal for the entire second half. Sophomore utility and former Hoosier Kate Pipkin scored two goals in the second half against her former team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the day with an 8-4 victory, looking confident for the games ahead.</p>\n<p>Day two of the Winter Invitational brought better weather and provided a tougher opponent in No. 8 Michigan. This was a defensive battle from the start. The first quarter came to a close with the score of 1-1 in an even matchup.</p>\n<p>The second quarter began with a quick goal from the Gauchos when freshman utility Abbey Grosse gave a nifty lob pass over the defender to Taylor Shore, who slotted it home for the goal.</p>\n<p>With about two minutes left in the half, the Wolverines scored to even it up at 2-2. The Gauchos went on to earn a power play with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half as head coach Serela Kay called a timeout. The ensuing play led to Shore finding the prolific Snyder for the goal to take the lead at 3-2.</p>\n<p>Michigan quickly responded with a lob shot attempt that landed on the line of the goal as the buzzer sounded, resulting in a no goal call from the referees.</p>\n<p>Michigan threw in three goals in the third as they began to pull away. UCSB found themselves down 4-5 heading into the final period.</p>\n<p>The Wolverine defense stepped up in the fourth period, making it difficult for the Gaucho attack time and time again. UCSB was unable to score in the quarter and was defeated 4-7.</p>\n<p>“The Michigan game really sticks out in my mind because we controlled the game all the way until the fourth quarter,” said Kay. “We’re young, so the fourth quarter moments and game situation moments are really important for us.”</p>\n<p>About an hour later, UCSB had to jump back in the pool for another game as they faced off against the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. The Gauchos dominated from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Natalie Selin scored a first quarter hat-trick as the Gauchos led 5-1 at the end of the opening quarter.</p>\n<p>Early in the third quarter, Shore earned another hat-trick as UCSB went up 9-3. Pomona-Pitzer added a couple more goals to their tally, but UCSB eventually earned their third win of the weekend by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The final day of the Winter Invite was layered with heavy rain and constant winds when UCSB squared off versus Marist, which scored double digit goals in its first two games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stayed with their defensive theme in this game, holding the Red Foxes to only two goals in the first half. UCSB’s balanced attack resulted in seven goals to make it 7-2 at the break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to make it difficult for Marist, which could only total five goals in the entire contest. Snyder and Shore stayed on their terrific goal-scoring pace, each scoring in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished off the Red Foxes by the score of 11-5 to earn their fourth victory of the weekend.</p>\n<p>As the rain slowly died down, UCSB took the pool against powerhouse No. 2 USC in the final game of the 2017 Winter Invitational. USC came into the game with an average margin of victory of over 11 goals in their previous four games at the Winter Invite.</p>\n<p>The Trojans continued their goal-scoring frenzy, pouring in seven goals in the first period of play. The Gauchos struggled to get anything together as they trailed 2-12 at the half.</p>\n<p>Snyder, Selin, Trabucco and senior attacker Brenna Thomas scored the Gauchos five goals in the game. USC never took its foot off the gas, winning 19-5 to give it an undefeated record for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Despite the tough loss to close out their host event, the Gauchos felt good about their performances throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with where we’re at,” Kay said. “I’m actually happy that the weather came in and was windy and stormy; I think it gave us something that we’re really not used to so I think it’ll make us stronger in the end.”</p>\n<p>Shore and Snyder led the team in goals with 11 each. The standout freshman Snyder was very productive over the weekend in her first action with the team.</p>\n<p>“She [Snyder] can play on the outside and on the inside,” Kay said. “She was scoring on power plays, on the perimeter and in front of the cage. She’s a scorer. She’s a finisher. She has no fear.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend, UCSB will make the trip to Tempe, Ariz., home of Arizona State, to take part in the Arizona State Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/","id":4923,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4922,4921,4920],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Fourth Straight, Tied For First In Conf.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womensbball-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womensbball-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team earned its fourth consecutive win in its 74-62 defeat of Hawaii Saturday night.

The six rebounds were a season-high for Jemerigbe to go along with 11 points and six assists. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler posted career-high totals with 17 points and two three-point makes.</p>\n<p>It was all UCSB to open the first quarter as the Gauchos shot 69.2 percent from the field and 4-for-5 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>The inside-outside game of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter was in full effect. Porter continued her hot shooting from the last two games, starting 3-for-3 from behind the perimeter. She would end the game 3-for-4 from the field and play just 10 minutes after enduring an apparent shoulder injury.</p>\n<p>Playing a major role in the Gauchos’ commanding start was their defense as Hawaii ended the period with five turnovers, in which UCSB capitalized off of with 11 points.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing by double-figures 23-9, it was the shooting of junior guard Sarah Toeaina that kept Hawaii within range of reducing its deficit all game. She went 3-for-6 in the first period, signaling the start of her finishing with a game-high 22 points on a 10-for-19 shooting afternoon.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second period, no basket was made by either team until the 6:41 mark for UCSB on a jumpshot by Toler to give UCSB a 25-15 lead.</p>\n<p>She was the Gauchos’ most active player in the period, scoring another basket as a result of a quick stop and go move to surpass the defender for a go-ahead layup and later earned a chase down block before eventually being subbed out.</p>\n<p>Toeaina remained the Rainbow Wahine’s primary source of offense with a jumpshot to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 27-21.</p>\n<p>With under two minutes remaining in the period, the Gauchos got back to feeding Edelman down low as she scored layups in the team’s last two possessions.</p>\n<p>A crucial three-pointer by sophomore forward Lahnia Salanoa brought Hawaii to its lowest first half deficit of five points, 31-26, to go into halftime.</p>\n<p>Jumpstarting Hawaii’s offense to its 7-2 run to open the second half was freshman guard Julissa Tago with a three-pointer and midrange jumpshot along the baseline. Tying the game at 33 apiece was Toeaina’s layup with 8:06 left in the third.</p>\n<p>Despite her reduced role this season, junior guard Makala Roper provided a quick surge off the bench with a three-pointer to end the tie and put UCSB up 36-33.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB maintained a lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Roper’s shot ignited the Gauchos’ 12-4 run that led to Hawaii calling a 20 second timeout.</p>\n<p>Providing a scoring outburst during the run was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez which included back-to-back three-pointers, increasing UCSB’s lead to 45-37, she scored all eight of her points in the quarter while shooting 3-for-5 and 2-for-4 from deep.</p>\n<p>Hawaii took advantage of UCSB’s scoreless play in the final 3:54 of the third as Toeaina would score two consecutive layups to help the Rainbow Wahine enter the game’s final period down 50-45.</p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, UCSB looked like the team it was to open the game as its grittiness was on full display as it embarked on an 8-0 run. Its offense was most efficient in the period, shooting 72.7 percent and 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>An offensive charge led to the Gauchos’ first possession. Scoring five of the eight was Edelman, putting her pivot foot to work and posting up for a turnaround AND-1 layup in which she converted at the foul line.</p>\n<p>Scoring the other three in the team’s next possession was Jemerigbe’s drive and circus layup that fell as she drew a foul that led to her making a free-throw to increase Santa Barbara’s lead to 58-45.</p>\n<p>A three-point make by Toler extended UCSB’s run to 11-3, but responding with a three of her own was senior guard Briana Harris to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 61-51.</p>\n<p>But the three-point shot wouldn’t be Toler’s last as she scored 10 points straight to give UCSB a 68-57 advantage.</p>\n<p>A quick jumpshot by Toeaina trimmed Santa Barbara’s lead to 66-57, but the Rainbow Wahine were unable to draw any closer as time continued to expire.</p>\n<p>With a 10-point lead of 68-58, helping secure the Gauchos’ 74-62 win was the veteran leadership of Jemerigbe. With the ball at the top of the key as time went by, Jemerigbe drove the right lane for a layup, came up with a steal in the game’s lasting seconds, and was clutch with a 4-for-7 finish at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>With its three-game home stand now over, UCSB will be on the road at Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, Jan. 25. The game will begin at  7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/","id":408,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[407,406,405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop First Match of the Year Versus No. 7 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Upon the completion of Saturday’s meet, UCLA managed to hand Santa Barbara its first loss of the regular season by a final tally of 5-2.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68683\" style=\"width: 496px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68683\" data-attachment-id=\"68683\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-01/no-27-ucsb-edged-in-home-opener-vs-no-70-pacific-rebound-against-fresno-st/nicolas-moreno-de-alboran-returns-the-ball-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-07-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Nicolas Moreno de Alboran returns the ball.

The Gauchos’ sophomore talents of Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno de Alboran bested the Bruins, Joseph Di Giulio and Austin Rapp, for the second decision of the meet.</p>\n<p>Singles matches commenced with Austin Rapp, of UCLA, defeating Holm in two sets at scores of 6-1 and 6-3</p>\n<p>Di Giulio maintained his school’s momentum as the Bruins went on to take the following singles match, against Gaucho junior Chase Masciorini, with 6-2 and 6-3 victories.</p>\n<p>Freund went on to claim UCSB’s only singles victory after playing Zhu, with final scores of 6-4 and 7-5.</p>\n<p>For the fourth singles match, UCLA’s Logan Staggs defeated junior Cody Rakela with 6-3 and 7-6 victories.</p>\n<p>The first three-set match came when Gage Brymer held off Alboran for the win after dropping the first score at 3-6, but then recuperated with 6-1 and 6-2 finishes.</p>\n<p>Redlicki and Mays really put on a show as the two highly esteemed athletes recorded yet another three-set match. Redlicki started with a comfortable 6-1 win, but Mays fought back in the second set at 5-7. Eventually, the tie-breaker went in favor of UCLA as Redlicki completed the win with a final 6-4 score.</p>\n<p>The final doubles match of the day ended at an ‘unfinished’ 5-5, which concluded the day’s meet altogether as UCLA beat UCSB at an overall match record of 5-2.</p>\n<p>The men’s tennis regular season returns next month, on the 11<sup>th</sup> of February, where UCSB will travel away to Stockton, CA for another non-conference meet against the University of the Pacific.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-drop-first-match-of-the-year-versus-no-7-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-drop-first-match-of-the-year-versus-no-7-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-drop-first-match-of-the-year-versus-no-7-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-drop-first-match-of-the-year-versus-no-7-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-drop-first-match-of-the-year-versus-no-7-ucla/","id":1113,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1112,1111,1110],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Remains Winless on the Road, Lose 65-55 at UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos fell to 0-8 on the road over the weekend after losing at the Highlanders and also fall to 1-4 in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_75077\" style=\"width: 615px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75077\" data-attachment-id=\"75077\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/maxwell-kupchak-moves-the-ball-down-the-court-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Maxwell Kupchak moves the ball down the court.

It also falls to 1-4 in the Big West and is now eighth place in the conference standings.

Compare that to UCR’s 45.5 percent (25-55) from the field and it’s no shock as to why the home team won the matchup. Even with winning the rebounding battle at 41-36 and shooting much better from the free-throw line, Santa Barbara as a team was not as efficient from the field as UC Riverside, resulting in its eighth road loss of the year.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders were leading for most of the first half behind the great play of senior guard Malik Thames, who had nine points on 4-5 shooting. Luckily for the Gauchos, Vincent was also clutch in the first half with 11 points, including two three-pointers and scoring his 1,000th career point in his career as a Gaucho, becoming only the 28th player in school history to accomplish this feat.</p>\n<p>With the score tied at 25 with only 1:20 left in the first frame, Childress knocked down two FT’s to give his team a 27-25 lead. However, Santa Barbara then conceded seven straight points before the end of the half, including three by Thames, to go down 32-27 at the break.</p>\n<p>After retaking the lead late in the first half, the Highlanders never looked back, keeping the score in their favor until the end of the match. In stretches during which it played good defense, UCSB was unable to knock down a shot to really cut into the lead and threaten UCR. In the second half, Santa Barbara shot only 28.1 percent from the field while UC Riverside shot 48.1 percent. UCSB was able to stay in the game due to its ability to get to the line, where it shot 9-12 in the half.</p>\n<p>The last great chance the Gauchos had to make this a game was with 6:44 left in the contest. After two made free-throws by junior forward Alex Hart making the score 53-47, UCSB forced a turnover and had three solid looks at cutting the lead to four, its lowest margin since early in the second half, but were unable to capitalize. UCR scored on the next possession and finished the Gauchos off 65-55.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 55-point night was the second lowest point total of the season, with its worst being a loss at UC Davis 73-47. UCSB seems to be its own worst enemy in nights like these, forcing shots that are not there while also missing open shots that should result in points.</p>\n<p>Despite solid first-half performances, Childress only managed two second-half points, while Vincent did put up a solid seven but on a very inefficient 3-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>This season has been very tough for the Gauchos, but with over 10 games left in Big West play, they cannot afford to give up just yet. This UCSB team has shown flashes of greatness in its win over Cal Poly and even in some tough losses like at LBSU.</p>\n<p>With a team that has such potential and still has the third leading scorer in the conference in Vincent, this team is capable of making a run; it just needs a bit of a push.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against CSUN at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 25 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Lancers, 2-5 overall and 1-3 in conference, opened up with a 4-0 run, forcing McLaughlin to call timeout right out of the gate.</p>\n<p>Three straight kills from star outside hitter Jacob Delson closed the gap, but it wasn’t until another Delson kill 27 points deep into the set that UCSB finally took a lead.

That lead held for the rest of the set, but the Gauchos were never quite able to shake Cal Baptist off.</p>\n<p>“Winning a [set] and then coming out there lax for the second [set], that’s what we’ve got to stop doing,” McLaughlin said. “It’s going to bite us at some point.”</p>\n<p>The Lancers came out hot again in the third set, but the Gauchos managed to assert their authority much quicker this time around. A general pattern of two points for UCSB, one point for Cal Baptist pushed the Gauchos out into a healthy 15-10 lead, which turned into a final tally of 25-16.</p>\n<p>Delson was, unsurprisingly, UCSB’s leading hitter Friday night with 15 kills, but it was his passing that really shone. The redshirt senior, along with brothers Parker (red shirt senior libero) and Hayden Boehle (junior outside hitter), drew praise from McLaughlin for their success in keeping the offense flowing.</p>\n<p>“I thought the three passers played great,” McLaughlin said. “[Delson] has playing great every night out, and he’s really leading us.”</p>\n<p>The strong work from the passing trio held the Lancers to only one ace on the night, while UCSB racked up five of their own. Redshirt sophomore middle blocker Henri Cherry led the Gauchos with two, while freshman middle blocker Keenan Sanders, Hayden Boehle and senior setter Grady Zant each had one of their own.</p>\n<p>Up next for UCSB is second-ranked UCLA in Westwood on Wednesday night at 7 p.m., the Gauchos’ first road game of this young season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/gauchos-sweep-through-cal-baptist-for-third-straight-victory/","id":5006,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5005,5004,5003],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":62,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
