We are hopeful in the next 4-6 games we get some good experience and we will see where we go.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be looking to shake off the rust from a season ago which saw them miss postseason play despite beginning the season 8-0 overall, their first time accomplishing such a feat since 1992. After the fast start, Santa Barbara would go 3-6-2 over their final 11 matches to finish the year 11-6-2 overall and 2-5-1 in conference play earning them a sixth place finish.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“That 8-0 start probably won’t happen again,” Stumpf said. “We caught a lot of breaks early in that 8-0 start and it felt like we didn’t catch any in the last few games. But I do think it was a great experience for us to recognize we have to take one game at a time, every game is this individual entity we have to prepare for and really be opportunistic when those breaks present themselves.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of the finish last year, Santa Barbara is poised to compete for a chance at the Big West crown again due to minimal losses from a season ago, returning vets and key freshman that hope to come in and contribute right away.</p>\n<p>In terms of losses, the Gauchos are only replacing three athletes that received significant playing time in Sydney Fuentes, a first team conference letter-winner, Dakota Griggs and Savannah Francis. Even with these players lost to graduation the Gauchos return many key players integral to the Gauchos great play last year. The list of these returners is headlined by senior forward Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>Ball became a breakout star last year scoring 10 goals for UCSB, the first double-digit scorer for the program since 2005. During the eight-game winning streak, the Chino Hills native scored seven goals including her first hat-trick against Fresno St. in the teams’ season opener.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56798\" style=\"width: 548px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-soccer/wsoccer_vsucd-dustinharris-10122014-05/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-56798\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56798\" data-attachment-id=\"56798\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-soccer/wsoccer_vsucd-dustinharris-10122014-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=1600%2C1177&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1177\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413120587\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"115\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=888%2C653&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-56798\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05-1024x753.jpg?resize=538%2C396\" alt=\"\" width=\"538\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?resize=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senior forward Amanda Ball. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Last year, Ball also received First Team All-Big West and All-Far West honors along with 21 total points. She missed the final two games of the season with an ankle sprain, however, she seems to be fully healthy heading into this new campaign.</p>\n<p>“10 goals are a great accomplishment for anybody,” Stumpf said. “But the last thing I want is her thinking she has to score 10 goals. She has to take everything one at a time. But she has looked really good in this first week as far as her maturity level, her ability to maintain possession and her finishing. She isn’t the typical vocal leader but she leads by example.”</p>\n<p>Ball will most likely not receive much playing time in these two exhibition matches, but Gaucho fans will definitely be awaiting her play come the season opener come August 18.</p>\n<p>Other notable returners include sophomore Mallory Hromatko who was tied second on the team in goals (4) and points (10), and seniors Kate Shoemaker, an experienced defender, and Chace Schornstein who has started in 56 out of 57 games in her time as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be exhibition matches without key matchups to look out for and new freshman to admire in their fresh UCSB jersey, especially with the depth that this new team has.</p>\n<p>“There are about five spots that are really up for grabs. Outside of Chace, Kate, Amanda, Mallory, everybody else really will be in competition. We like the depth of this years’ team but we are kind of a smaller team and we will need to make adjustments when we face those big, physical direct playing teams.”</p>\n<p>“There are three [freshman] that really jump out at us. First being Christine Mauer, a really good finisher near the goal who I expect will get good minutes up front. Cate Post, a player who could play different positions for us and really earn significant minutes and Belinda Ascensio, who has not joined the team yet due to a family emergency, however, when she comes in and as long as she passes the fitness exam, we expect her to make an impact.”</p>\n<p>As for the two teams the Gauchos will be facing, Westmont, a Division-II program, was defeated by UCSB in last years’ exhibition but played excellent posting a 16-4-2 overall record losing in the second round of the NAIA National Tournament.</p>\n<p>North Texas also had a great season in 2016 going 15-5-1 with a 9-1 conference record but did not receive a NCAA bid last year despite the accolades after losing in the C-USA conference tournament final. Had it won, NT would’ve repeated as conference champs and would’ve been awarded the automatic NCAA bid. The Mean Green were voted No. 1 in the leagues preseason poll to win their third straight C-USA regular season championship.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its exhibition season against Westmont tonight at 7 p.m. and will face North Texas on Saturday at 7 p.m. with both games being played at Harder Stadium.

The redshirt junior guard was forced to sit all last year thanks to NCAA transfer rules but was a dominant force once she got on the court this year.</p>\n<p>Toler was at the center of the comeback with 12 points and five rebounds in the second half alone, and her three-pointer served as the climax of a 32-11 UCSB second half run.</p>\n<p>Seemingly awakened by UCSB’s surprise surge, the 49ers fought back, going 3-4 from the field while turning up the defensive intensity once again. Toler and LBSU guard Madison Montgomery went back and forth, trading baskets as the clock ticked down.</p>\n<p>Toler drew two shooting fouls with under a minute left and knocked down two of her four free throws. It wasn’t enough to give the Gauchos the lead, but it was enough to bring them within one shot of the win.</p>\n<p>UCSB got that one shot, a corner three-pointer from junior guard Sarah Porter, but the ball hit the lip of the rim and fell off. The miss gave Long Beach the win and the bid to the NCAA Tournament, a program first for the 49ers.</p>\n<p>Despite not winning the match, the game between UCSB and LBSU was an instant classic to all those who attended and definitely lit a fire in Porter, Toler and the rest of this squad to change this script next year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 8 of the June 8, 2017,

The 12th-place finish was high enough for him to receive the bid to the NCAA Championships.</p>\n<p>Now, this might seem like another success story of a talented college athlete, but Kuskey’s path has been far from the norm and much more insightful.</p>\n<p>Most Division I athletes have been playing their respective sports growing up, becoming familiar with the ins and outs, learning the accompanying techniques and etiquette. Most Division I athletes also have access to a facility that is suitable for hosting competitions. Kuskey isn’t like most Division 1 athletes.</p>\n<p>Growing up in the Santa Barbara area, Kuskey attended Santa Ynez Valley Union High and graduated in 2012. Gifted athletically, Kuskey played football and basketball, and was also on varsity golf for all four years. On top of this, he was the captain of the golf team as a junior and senior. For someone who will be competing at the highest level of collegiate track in roughly a week, Kuskey’s high school athletic resume is missing something.</p>\n<p>Because track season occurred at the same time as golf season in high school, Kuskey was forced to stick with golf in the spring sports, never getting the shot to become a four-sport athlete. Being so talented at golf, Kuskey’s choice was simple: He continued playing golf, never running track.</p>\n<p>After receiving a one-year deferred admission from USC, his dream school, Kuskey decided to go to SBCC for a year before fighting on as a Trojan. However, after a year in Santa Barbara, there would be no USC Fight Song in Kuskey’s future.</p>\n<p>While at SBCC, Kuskey decided to begin training as a decathlete. Decathletes compete in four track events as well as six field events. Kuskey described his decision to pursue track, “It was always a dream of mine to play a sport in college; I was athletic in high school.” Being a three-sport athlete and then just deciding to give decathlete training a try, Kuskey is more than just “athletic.”</p>\n<p>As he was on the track at SBCC, Kuskey was spotted by someone from UCSB who saw potential in the track and field novice — so much potential, in fact, that Kuskey was convinced to come to UCSB for track and field as a freshman.</p>\n<p>The javelin emerged as Kuskey’s specialty, and all of a sudden, after having never run a day of track in high school, Kuskey was competing at his first NCAA regionals in Austin, Texas, as a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“It was really unexpected, actually, [but] I’ve always sort of been a really competitive type and never really liked the feeling of being bad at something,” Kuskey said. “It’s obviously a lot of work and javelin is a very technical event. It took a lot of endurance.”</p>\n<p>The mindset and practice from succeeding in multiple other sports helped Kuskey just as much as his natural athleticism. Without the discipline and ability to ignore distractions, he wouldn’t be where he is today.</p>\n<p>“Being in a D1 program for the past four years has taught me a lot about time management, at times doing more track than school, double days — everybody does it on the team,” Kuskey said.</p>\n<p>The hard work and dedication has clearly paid off for Kuskey, but perhaps more rewarding have been the experience of being involved with track in college. While there are plans for the renovation of the UCSB track, the well-known poor condition of the track has been bringing the team together.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’re the underdogs sort of unites us. The track team is pretty close, we’re all pretty good friends. We use that underdog mentality to our benefit,” Kuskey said. “It’s pretty cool [when you see a] 250-pound thrower is cheering on the distance runners, and you can feel the energy; everyone feeds off each other.”</p>\n<p>This attitude and environment of track has clearly driven Kuskey to thrive in the sport, but Kuskey isn’t slowing down anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Kuskey is succeeding in more than just sports. He is graduating at the end of this quarter with a degree in political science with an emphasis in international relations, and he’s already been commuting two days a week to Manhattan Beach for an internship in sports marketing.</p>\n<p>Kuskey credits his all-around success to his involvement and experience in sports. “Being an athlete and being on track has prepared me for a work environment, and employers know that.”</p>\n<p>While it may seem reasonable for a graduating senior to be stressed with so much going on, Kuskey is extremely calm and ready for everything to come. Ubiquitous questions of jobs, places to stay and graduation photos have of course been evident this spring for seniors, but Kuskey has had to juggle his track postseason on top of all this.</p>\n<p>Thinking about his life after graduation, Kuskey did manage to crack a joke: “It’ll be pretty interesting for the first time in my life without having 8 a.m. workouts.”</p>\n<p>He’s had to travel to Austin, Texas, and now he’s planning his trip to Eugene, Ore. Having a conversation with Kuskey, you’d never know how much he has on his plate due to his composed nature. The top-24 javelin thrower in the country humbly discussed only some of his achievements, but he won both the Big West Championship and the UCLA-hosted Pac 12 Invitational this year in addition to qualifying for the NCAA Track and Field Championships.</p>\n<p>Traveling to Eugene this year is well-deserved for Kuskey, as he competed in regionals for the third time this year, but he is barely shaken by the intensity of where he’ll be next week on June 8.</p>\n<p>“I’m a little bit nervous. I try not to think about it too much; I’ve been training for this for four years,” Kuskey said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/","id":1871,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1870,1869,1868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2017 Nexus Sports Awards – Welcome to the Next Level: Armani Smith & Lindsey Ruddins Named “Nexus” Freshmen of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/freshman-poty.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/freshman-poty.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Freshman don't produce, right?

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At first glance, Armani Smith, does not look like a freshman. In fact, he is already built like the big-league prospect that he is. Standing at 6’3” and weighing 195 pounds, the young utility baseball player from De La Salle High School was drafted in the 35th round by the Cleveland Indians before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>In his first year, Smith burst onto the scene for the Gauchos, hitting well for the majority of the season while playing solid defense in the field. At one point, the freshman was batting third with an average north of .350. Although Smith cooled down a bit, the young Gaucho star finished the season hitting .285 with three homeruns, 24 runs batted in and 32 runs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But those are just numbers. Smith’s play goes far deeper than what the numbers say. To simply put it, the kid does not get cheated at the plate. With every swing, even when fooled, Smith would let it fly. At times, Smith would swing <em>so</em> hard that even on misses the crowd would “Ooh” and “Ahh” in amazement. The three home runs hit by Smith were not your typical DI home runs, either. Smith would hit one out to deep right center, to deep center <em>on a line</em> and to left field that would clear not only the scoreboard but also the protective net that shields buildings near the stadium. That ball easily soared more than 400 feet, which is scary coming from a freshman. The kid has serious pop.</p>\n<p>What was even more impressive than his tools, though, was how selfless he was for his team. Smith would rover from right field, to left field to second base while moving around in the line-up all season long. Now, this may not sound like a big deal, but playing several positions while being moved around the line-up is one of the most uncomfortable things for a player to do, but Smith made it look easy. Without a doubt, for all his efforts, Armani Smith deserves to be the <em>Nexus</em> Sports Male Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsey Ruddins (W Volleyball) by Omar Hernandez</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78325\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78325\" data-attachment-id=\"78325\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lindsey Ruddins soars through the air while serving.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins had one of the most dominant individual seasons of any athlete at UCSB this year. The redshirt freshman from Laguna Niguel was a scourge on the offensive end, earning the Big West Freshman of the Year award, which hadn’t been awarded to a Gaucho volleyball player since 2012.</p>\n<p>She received a host of other accolades as well, making both the All-Big West and All-Freshman teams along with notching five Freshman of the Week awards.</p>\n<p>On a national level, Ruddins became the first Gaucho since 2012 to be named to the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) All-American team as an honorable mention, and she also earned honorable mention honors on the AVCA All-Pacific South Region team.</p>\n<p>The year Ruddins had would be considered extraordinary for any player, much less a freshman. To be third in the conference in both kills per set (4.09) and total kills (389) and then sixth in the conference in service aces per set (.31) was no coincidence.</p>\n<p>It shows only the dedication that Ruddins put into practice (redshirting her whole first year to hone her skills) but also her ability to translate what she has learned into an enormous impact on the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB improved by five wins this season, and a lot of that improvement has to do with Ruddins’s exceptional year. Both she and the team have a lot of room to grow; the Gauchos have never made it to the final four of the NCAA tournament, and she still has three years to work on her game.

The Gauchos were 6-4-2 when Feucht recorded a point.</p>\n<p>The German national became the sixth UCSB player ever to score a goal in five straight games as he helped UCSB capture its fourth consecutive Big West North Division title.</p>\n<p>His breakout performance earned him the 2016 Big West Midfielder of the Year award, making him the fifth Gaucho to earn the award since 2004.</p>\n<p>In addition, Feucht was one of two juniors to be named to the All-Big West First Team, which marks his second straight selection for the honor.</p>\n<p>For Feucht, the next logical step in his career would involve winning the Big West Offensive Player of the Year, which could perhaps lead to him entering the discussion of the MAC Hermann Trophy as the nation’s player of the year.</p>\n<p>However, returning to the NCAA College Cup in his senior year would certainly be the more desired feat for one of the Big West’s elite talents.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/","id":583,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[582,581,580],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2017 Nexus Sports Awards – Leading the Gaucho Pack: Bonnie Henrickson and Marty Davis Earn “Nexus” Coach of the Year Awards","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coty.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coty.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winning \"Coach of the Year\" were UCSB women's basketball's Bonnie Henrickson and UCSB men's tennis' Marty Davis.

Davis has been a coach for the UCSB tennis team since 2000, and he has done a terrific job. He has been the Big West Conference Coach of the Year a total of nine times and has led the tennis program to 10 Big West titles and NCAA appearances, including the ones during the outstanding year they had this year.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s tennis team went a solid 19-6 this year with Davis at the helm. This included a resounding 5-0 record in conference play and a respectable 6-3 record in home games. They ended their season with a 4-1 loss to the University of Mississippi in the NCAA Championship, but this was not all for nothing. The team showed out all season, and this included a 4-1 win against rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>Davis rallied the troops once again this season, and the team responded with an outstanding performance all year. He showed once again why he is one of the best — if not the best — coaches around and why he was invited to and honored at the ATP finals last year. He has taken the UCSB men’s tennis team from a good team to a great team, and his style of play has the Gauchos performing to the best of their ability, and they seemed to be firing on all cylinders before their loss to Ole Miss. This just shows how Davis has transformed the program and justifies his selection for Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78412\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78412\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/","id":1208,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1207,1206,1205],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Orlando Magic Forward Aaron Gordon Surprises UCSB, Trains in Thunderdome","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-27-at-12.46.06-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-27-at-12.46.06-PM.png?resize=714%2C372&ssl=1","description":"Expect the unexpected as the possibilities are endless here at UCSB as Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon made an appearance Thursday night to show fans love and get some shots up in the Thunderdome. ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A casual browsing of one’s Twitter timeline typically includes the latest news in politics, sports, music, a plethora of opinions, and of course, memes … things wouldn’t be the same without memes.</p>\n<p>But Thursday night was a surprise for the usual NBA fan at UCSB as Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon sent out a tweet that he would be getting some shots up in the Gauchos’ Thunderdome.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I’ll be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCSBbasketball\">@UCSBbasketball</a> THUNDER DOME getting shots up tonight.

But his good deed was prevented from happening as liability concerns during the T-Dome’s after hours prohibited entrance aside from Gordon and his crew.</p>\n<p>But fans waiting in the night managed to get something in return as Gordon’s persistent plea to at least let fans in the gym to take photos was permitted prior to him beginning his workout.</p>\n<p>Although not in attendance, UCSB men’s basketball Head Coach Joe Pasternack’s presence was still felt as Gordon’s appearance was a reminder of the new coach’s aim to reestablish fun and excitement into the Gaucho program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has shown love. Since I’ve been in Santa Barbara, [I figured] I’d peek through here, come through and get workouts in, they’ve always shown love,” Gordon said. “Now that Joe Pasternack is here, he’s shown love to me since I was on the Oakland Soldiers, playing with Archbishop Mitty [High School]. It’s just good to have a friend out here, he gets us in the gym. I wish I could have got everybody in [the Thunderdome], but you know there’s rules and regulations. It’s good to have Joe here, he’s really going to help the program out a lot.”</p>\n<p>During Pasternack’s tenure with the University of Arizona from 2011-2016, Gordon was a “one and done” player for the Wildcats in their 2013-14 season. He is one of many players, including former Wildcat and current Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson who was training in the Thunderdome two weeks ago, that Pasternack played a significant role in when recruiting and developing the two All-American talents.</p>\n<p>Entering his fourth NBA season, Gordon is coming off a career year in which he started in 72 of 80 games and recorded a career-high 12.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The former No. 4 pick of the 2014 NBA Draft is focused on the well-being of his body going into next season after a foot injury gave him trouble entering the All-Star break, which was evident in his underwhelming performance in the 2017 Slam Dunk Contest.</p>\n<p>“That’s the biggest thing, to get healthy. Find a rhythm, get healthy. As long as I’m healthy, everything ‘s going to be golden. I’ma do what I love to do,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>With many aware of his freakish athleticism, Gordon has his sight set on taking his game further. Speculation as to whether or not he fits best at the small forward or power forward position had been up for debate throughout the majority of the season. No permanent answer has emerged regarding Gordon’s placement, but he flourished throughout the season.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4Subr0F21k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>When asked about the area of his game that he is focusing on this offseason, Gordon kept it straightforward – “shooting threes.”</p>\n<p>With that being said, he seems to remain motivated to fill the hybrid/stretch role that Orlando is hoping for him to be. If health can work in his favor, anticipating a breakout season for Gordon may not be too far-fetched.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Dangerous. Untamed.</p>\n<p>These are the common misconceptions about life here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Overcoming, this false illusion has always been difficult, but the tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014, was an unfortunate yet compelling reminder of the love and unity that reside within the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>Prior to this date, preparing to graduate from St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif., and having already verbally committed to the UCSB men’s basketball team back in Aug. 2013, current junior shooting guard Gabe Vincent seemed to have everything figured out.</p>\n<p>But he, too, once shared uncertainty before this decision, yet his perspective was corrected as he was gradually integrated into the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>“When I was in high school and people would bring up [UCSB], it started to get a bad reputation. Everybody knew it was a party school, but that’s kind of a two-sided coin. People like to party and have fun and go to school, but some people are discouraged by that,” Vincent explained. “I for sure was at first. When you think of UCSB, most of the time that’s what you think of. Yes, you get a great education, but that party scene over there might be too wild. [But] the more I came out and got involved with the community and saw what they were about and got more comfortable here, [I saw] that people are in the library 24/7, people are grinding, taking classes, and that’s just a way for them to let loose. The community is so small that people are all together; it allows everyone to enjoy life together, which is awesome because not many places can have that.”</p>\n<p>As someone who had confirmed his love for basketball in the sixth grade and who was determined to put his all into the sport once he started playing at the AAU level, Vincent saw the advantages of UCSB’s location, beautiful women and Division I status, which seemed to provide an opportunity any prospective student-athlete would desire to seize.</p>\n<p>But the potential to be the university’s next star player with such incentives at his fingertips took a backseat during his realization of UCSB’s ability to bond and unite after the tragic loss of innocent lives just a year before his official enrollment at the school.</p>\n<p>“I came out here a lot, I took a few unofficial [visits] just to come see the guys practice. I had been out in I.V. and had seen that culture and kind of got accustomed to it to a point that it already felt like home. That was a big thing for me coming here because you have to be able to live somewhere when you’re not playing basketball, too,” Vincent said. “So when I heard the news about the shooting, that’s something that, even if you’re not attached to the school emotionally or physically, when you read that kind of tragedy, that hits your heart because that’s something that should never happen and is terrible to read or hear.”</p>\n<p>“When you are attached to it, like we are now, and I kind of was in a way then, it definitely hit home. It was sad to hear; I remember I came out the following weekend because I was coming up on another unofficial [visit] to see the guys practice, and even they were down,” Vincent said. “Looking out to the streets of I.V., they were dead quiet, nobody was out. The whole community was mourning what had happened. That was eye-opening because it’s not just everybody out here for themselves. Even though there are cliques or groups, we are still one strong community. The way people came together for that was inspiring.”</p>\n<p>Rather than be deterred from his choice to attend UCSB after such a horrific moment that made headlines nationwide, Vincent’s empathy influenced his newfound interpretation of such a unique community.</p>\n<p>The foundation for this compassion comes from Vincent’s parents, Cynthia and Franklyn, who are both psychologists. Once quoted saying his upbringing was “different,” Vincent holds a perspective of this three-year anniversary that only he can understand.</p>\n<p>“To me, honestly, psychology, even though there’s many facets of it, a lot of the times it’s just being able to read in-between the lines. A lot of people are going to put on a front or show this or that, but that might not be what they’re really feeling or showing,” Vincent said. “I think that plays a big role in terms of relating to people and being able to talk to them and gauge how a conversation will flow [to see if] they’re upset or figure out what they want to talk about; you can use [psychology] in so many different ways.”</p>\n<p>“Seeing the guys and the community in that way, you could see it was genuine grief. People were really going through it and it was a struggle for everyone. Naturally, when that happens, you start thinking about yourself and how you could’ve done better. Even though you might have not been directly in the situation, you start to think, ‘Man, I could have done that differently,’ and that could’ve changed somebody else’s life in a positive way.Unfortunately it had to happen in that way, but I think it was eye-opening and some people made some changes.”</p>\n<p>As a leader on this season’s team that included only one senior, the impact of the tragedy isn’t as evident. But, the fact that this year’s graduating class will be the last of the UCSB and Isla Vista communities that were in the areas during the incident is still very prevalent.</p>\n<p>“I think there has been an unbelievable amount of support, with the blue lights and the awareness around campus. But I feel like as one generation comes and goes and [with] this senior class being the last [group] that were really here for it, I think that plays a major role in it kind of [being] forgotten, which I hope it doesn’t because I hope that community can stay strong,” Vincent said. “A lot of universities have four years in, four years out, and it’s almost like a new culture or new tradition. I hope that’s something that can stay alive, and hopefully, through the different support systems on campus, they can keep the community strong together and let them know that things can happen, it doesn’t matter where you are. There’s been many other instances at universities, and I think that it’s important to not keep these things relevant but on your mind.”</p>\n<p>Whether or not time heals all wounds can only be determined by the individual. While the pain and disbelief of what took place on May 23, 2014, still causes grief for many, the recovery from this tragedy is still taking place and can be sustained with a communal effort.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista is a special place. It’s right on the beach, it’s right next to campus. It’s a great diverse group, and I think it’s important to keep in mind, especially with this class leaving, and we have some younger guys on the team [who are like] ‘It’s the anniversary of what?’ and you can already kind of see it becoming forgotten,” Vincent said. “I don’t think it’s anything to run away from, the history of that [event], because you can’t change time. [Embracing] that and keeping the discussion open, be willing to talk about it and let people know what happened. Obviously you don’t want history to repeat itself; that’s the last thing this community could need or want.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/","id":1890,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1889,1888,1887],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Secures Victory in Opening Game of Hawaii Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Baseball_vsCSUN-20160416-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Baseball_vsCSUN-20160416-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos managed to strike first in the win column of its series against Hawaii following the continued dominance of slugger Austin Bush.

Smith then advanced to second on a wild pitch, Hornung’s second wild pitch of the inning, giving the Gauchos an extra base. With Smith on second and Burns on third, the all-mighty and powerful Austin Bush, who struck out swinging in his first at-bat, crushed a three-run jack for No. 19 of the year to surpass Tyler Von Schell (18 HRs, 2001).</p>\n<p>After Bush cleared them, senior outfielder Billy Fredrick got on with a walk, and junior utility Kenny Corey drilled an RBI triple to left field to add one more run before the end of the first half of the third and make it 5-0.</p>\n<p>Hawaii had an opportunity to retaliate and score in the bottom of the third with two outs when junior second baseman Johnny Weeks singled to right and Davis loaded the bases after handing over two consecutive walks, but Davis then got himself out of the inning by striking out final batter sophomore Kekai Rios to leave all three Rainbow Warriors stranded.</p>\n<p>Both sides left one guy on base through a scoreless fourth, and if Hornung thought Bush might have had enough for the day after achieving his record, he was sorely mistaken. One homer was certainly not enough for Bush, as he opened the top of the fifth with a solo shot to right center for home run No. 20 of the season before Hornung sent the following three Gauchos back to the dugout.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the fifth started with Rainbow Warriors redshirt junior Chayce Kaaua both reaching first and advancing to second on back-to-back throwing errors from UCSB junior shortstop JJ Muno. Kaaua then went to third on a single to right center from junior center fielder Dylan Vchulek, who rounded and made it to second on the throw, and RBI team leader freshman Dustin Demeter finally drove in some runs for Hawaii with a single to left, increasing his running RBI count from 27 to 29 and changing the score board from a 6-0 shutout to a 6-2 four-run deficit.</p>\n<p>However, this four-run deficit would increase to a five-run deficit with a score of 7-2 by the top of the eighth when the Gauchos added one final run on an RBI sac-bunt from Grover, while Hawaii’s bats were only able to produce those two runs for the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>Games two and three of this weekend’s series at Les Murakami Stadium will prove to be just as important as this one, with the 2017 season coming to a close and Santa Barbara and Hawaii now tied in BWC standings. Both squads will be looking to knock each other down while chasing UC Davis (9-13 BWC), who is just one game ahead in conference.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/","id":4116,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4115,4114,4113],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Life Goes On: UCSB Baseball Reflects on Return to I.V.

The team was all smiles in the locker room until they heard the news of the tragic events that took place in I.V. that evening.</p>\n<p>“We were on the road when that happened, at Davis, actually, and we reached out to the guys not on the travel squad to make sure they were okay,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Despite the shooting, UCSB still had to play a game against UC Davis on Saturday, the final game of the three-game set. For better or for worse, Santa Barbara took the field with heavy hearts and mustered a 6-3 victory to secure a sweep of the Aggies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the Gauchos finally came home after their win on Saturday, they didn’t come home to the same place they had left just a few days ago. The once lively campus was instead filled with sorrow and pain.</p>\n<p>Instead of being able to celebrate a sweep of UC Davis and possibly a chance at making the postseason, many of the players had to learn quickly the horrors of what had happened.</p>\n<p>Walking off the pitch after a final win of the season on Tuesday defeating USC 11-2, the UCSB men’s baseball found itself in the same place it had been three years ago.</p>\n<p>Moments before the game, the team held a moment of silence to remember the tragedy that befell UCSB. Whether it was a player, coach or someone who worked with UCSB athletics, the tragedy made them realize that changes were necessary for their own lives and beyond.</p>\n<p>“Because baseball allows these kids to have their own culture, they had a healthy distraction and each other, really, to help them cope with this,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>One of the people who did not travel with the team three years ago was Sports Information Director Andrew Wagner. An S.I.D.’s job requires them to write previews and recaps of the teams they cover while releasing any breaking news about the team in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Wagner still serves as the S.I.D. of multiple sports, including the baseball team that he was covering at the time.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t travel with the team on that long trip, and despite having graduated a couple years back, I still lived in Isla Vista,” Wagner said. “So I was in town when this happened; I actually lived about 100 feet from the 7-Eleven where part of the shooting happened, and I just remember all the texts and calls asking if I was okay. It almost just didn’t feel real. This isn’t supposed to happen here, but it did.”</p>\n<p>Despite not being a student anymore, the event stuck around in Wagner’s mind.</p>\n<p>“It was just a night-and-day type of experience after the shooting,” Wagner said. “For a while after that, everybody just felt numb; it was weird. You just don’t imagine something like that happening in California,” Wagner said, “much less Santa Barbara and much less at UCSB where everything is more carefree, relaxed and happy.</p>\n<p>Andrew made note of the fact that this shooting was a sort of wake-up call for him, and he, like many others, tried to cope with the horrific incident that took UCSB by storm.</p>\n<p>“One of the craziest experiences I’ve had was the vigil at Harder Stadium, where both sides of the stands were packed tight but there was no noise. Everybody was so sad and in a state of disbelief,” Wagner said. “That vigil really hit close to home in multiple ways because, for a while, UCSB became known for partying and the shooting, and it made me so sad because this is such a great university and that’s not always the reputation it gets.”</p>\n<p>For Checketts in particular, a man with children of his own, this tragedy brought forth the memory of another shooting that made him re-evaluate.</p>\n<p>Checketts said. “When Sandy Hook happened, it opened my eyes. Having young kids and looking at those little faces made me sad and angry. Looking at this from our community standpoint, it was obviously scary. Isla Vista is my community. I live just around the corner. When it happens so close to home, it sure makes it a lot more real. Unfortunately, from a country standpoint, it happens so often and at such a high rate relative to other developed countries, it gets frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Since this shooting, Checketts has been involved in trying to find solutions to the current gun issue the United States faces.</p>\n<p>“There were victims in the Isla Vista tragedy that weren’t caused by gunfire and I recognize that, but as a 40-year-old man with young kids, this tragedy has motivated me to look more closely at how we handle our guns in this country. In California, we have seen some progress on this issue with some recent legislation, but more needs to be done…Families shouldn’t have to go through this kind of pain as regularly as they do in our country.”</p>\n<p>Three years later, the pain the community once felt has subsided, but it still lingers around this time. UCSB defeating USC on Tuesday wasn’t the Yankees winning the World Series after 9/11 or the Saints winning a Super Bowl after Katrina, but it was a sign that life does, in fact, go on. You can try to improve the problems we face every day, and there is beauty in that.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can completely stop bad things from happening across our country, but we have other developed countries with a fraction of the gun violence that we have and should be looking at their models and potential solutions to reduce our risk of gun violence. The tragedy in Isla Vista is another unfortunate reminder that we aren’t immune to gun violence, even in paradise.” Checketts said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

From the dominant performances of sophomore Sierra Altmeyer and junior Jessica Johnston to the team’s overall designation as one of the Big West’s deadliest offenses (finishing as the conference leader in hits at 448), to the solid pitching of sophomore Veronika Gulvin, the storylines surrounding the team this year were all intriguing.</p>\n<p>There were some shortcomings as well. The Gauchos’ inability to beat the lowest ranked teams in the conference cost them in their pursuit of the top seed, and they weren’t able to make a large enough impact in the NISC tournament, but looking deeper into the positives shows just how special this year was.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The one-two punch offered by Johnston and Altmeyer was as good or better as any in the conference. Johnston finished the season second on the team in hits (63), runs (34), homeruns (5) and doubles (13). The junior also received the Big West Player of the Week award in April and finished the year with a .339/.376/.511 clip while also serving as a great outfielder.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer capitalized her breakout sophomore season by leading the squad in home-runs (10), batting avg. (.354), OBP (.457) and SLG percentage (.634). She also played stellar defense in the infield and only seems to be improving as she advances into the final half of her playing career here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Whether it was Johnston’s late-game heroics propelling the Gauchos over a top pitcher in the conference or Altmeyer putting a game out of reach with an early home run, these two learned to complement each other and make their teammates better around them, and their continued growth is something to look forward to for next season.</p>\n<p>On the other side it was Gulvin (17-14) who held the UCSB pitching staff steady the whole year, while junior Lena Mayer (5-2) became lights-out as the Gauchos moved toward the end of the season. Gulvin had such a special year, not only because she was able to improve on her numbers from her freshman year by a big amount, but also because became the team’s leader in almost all counting stats which is a big feat considering she shouldered a huge amount of the innings.</p>\n<p>That load was lightened at the end by Mayer, who won five of her last six outings, turning in some clutch performances against some of the top teams in the conference. Overall, the whole pitching staff had a solid year, and if Gulvin and Mayer keep on improving then next year they will be in contention as top pitchers in the conference.</p>\n<p>As a whole, this team had many accomplishments worthy of praise. They finished third in the Big West, made it into the postseason and put any team, whether nationally ranked San Diego State or first place CSU Fullerton, on notice. While UCSB’s all-time hits leader senior Kristen Clark will be ending a decorated career which includes three All-Big West selections as she prepares to graduate, most of the key pieces will be back for next year.</p>\n<p>If Coach Brie Galicinao can make the necessary adjustments, this team will again be in contention for the Big West title next year and can certainly make a deep run into the NCAA tournament.<em><br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

With their last defeat coming all the way back on April 10 versus UC Davis, this pair has proven time and time again that they’re able to compete at an elite level.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On a specifically top-10 basis, Freund and Mays have gone 2-0.

This marks the third consecutive year that the Gauchos have sent at least 11 or more athletes to the NCAA West Regionals.</p>\n<p>The NCAA first round is a preliminary competition held at two sites, one in the west in Austin, Texas, and one in the east in Jacksonville, Fla. Both events are held on the same day simultaneously, with the top 48 athletes in open events and the top 24 relay teams from each region competing for a top-12 finish to move on to the Finals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be represented by six female athletes and five male athletes who each will be competing in single events. They will be led by the efforts of seniors Maxine Goyette, in the 3000m steeple, and Matthew Kuskey, throwing the javelin, both of whom are making their second consecutive Western Regional appearances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Goyette finished with her best time ever in the 3000m steeplechase with a mark of 10:28.43 while taking silver during the Big West Championships last week, which thereby moved her to third all-time at UCSB in that event.

In just her sophomore season, she has moved into second all-time at UCSB in both of those events, and now she will be looking to build upon her early success in her first Western Regional appearance. She will be joined by senior Shannon Trumbull, as they both will represent UCSB in the women’s 400m hurdles.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting athlete to keep an eye on would be junior Jenna Hinkle, who has consistently improved her finishing times throughout her career and is also coming off an astounding 2016 cross country season, during which she established herself as a national contender after finishing fifth in the Stanford Invitational with a time of 20:31.1.</p>\n<p>She will be competing in the women’s 1500m after taking home gold for the second year in a row at the Big West Championships last week. Her PR of 4:16.67 last year is currently ranked No. 26 in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Senior Tori Usgaard has done it all for the Gauchos since joining the program four years ago. Her versatility includes competing in the heptathlon, long jump, high jump, 4 x 400m and 100m hurdles, which are just some of the ways she has contributed to UCSB’s success in recent years. She will compete in the long jump when traveling to Austin this week after finishing with a mark of 19-04.25 at the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>Concluding the women participants is senior Valerie Nestor, who, like Goyette, is peaking at the right time, considering she marked a personal best at the Big West Regionals with a 195-08 hammer throw. This will be her first time being invited to the Western Regionals in the hammer throw, and she has consistently made tremendous strides in her craft year after year to get to this point.</p>\n<p>Senior Adam Avila will be the sole male Gaucho competing in a running event. After claiming Big West Silver in the 3,000m steeplechase as a sophomore, Avila earned gold while in Fullerton with a time of 9:00.43, helping the Gauchos take the top-two conference spots in the event. Using back-to-back sub-nine minute efforts in the event over the course of seven days, Avila qualified for the NCAA First Round with a personal best time of 8:59.40.</p>\n<p>The remaining men’s track athletes will represent UCSB in throwing events, including senior Matthew Kuskey, senior Stephen Leach, junior Chris Ross and junior Kordell Hampton. In just his second season throwing the javelin, Kuskey qualified for the NCAA First Round in the event. He took home gold at the Big West Championships last week in the javelin with a throw of 218-08. He aims to return to the NCAA postseason and crack the UCSB All-Time list in the event. Ross will join him in the javelin at the Western Regionals after finishing second to Kuskey at the Big West Championships with a PR mark of 202-02.</p>\n<p>Hampton, UCSB school record-holder in the discus, came within an inch of his best mark to grab Big West silver. The junior, on his second to the last throw, found his place on the podium and notched his second-best career mark at 181-01. This will be his first appearance in the Western Regionals.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Leach will compete in the shot put after coming within a foot of his PR to score points in one of the deepest Big West shot put fields ever. Finishing eighth at the Big West Championships with a mark of 52-10.25, Leach looks to improve upon his achievements and be a formidable contender in the Western Regionals.</p>\n<p>Competition begins Thursday, May 25, with the 400m dash and concludes Saturday, May 27, with the 4x400m relay.

The random bouts of anxiety that hit us at various moments throughout our day are something we all can relate to. Just like us regular students, most athletes that participate in Division I athletics here at Santa Barbara feel that same pressure.</p>\n<p>See, not every athlete has dreams of going pro in their respective sport. Even the few who do have that dream rarely have the opportunity to make it to the professional level coming from such a small D1 program.</p>\n<p>Now that’s not to say there isn’t an advantage to being a student athlete here at a school like UCSB. In many cases, there are a bunch of small wins that come with being an athlete, such as being able to pick classes earlier, getting some great gear and most importantly for some, a free education at one of the nation’s top public schools.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But just like in the real world, what you decide to do with your opportunity at a free education is something that will play a factor in what happens down the road in your life.</p>\n<p>Kayte Christensen is a perfect example of a woman who has taken every advantage of every opportunity given to her in life, including the sport she played for many years — basketball. During her senior campaign, she averaged 14.5 points per game and grabbed 9.1 rebounds per game leading to her winning the 2002 Big West Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Mark French was a special coach and the whole coaching staff was great,” Christensen said. “I just think my senior year especially was my favorite year just because of the group of people I was with and the human beings that were here and what we accomplished.”</p>\n<p>However, basketball was never really a part of Christensen’s life goals while she was here at UCSB. In fact, the former Gaucho always had dreams of one day living a life away from basketball.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to teach classics and be a classics professor. That’s what I studied and that’s where my focus was, and I never thought about playing professionally,” Christensen said. “I didn’t want to play overseas; I played basketball to get an education, and I wanted to continue that path.”</p>\n<p>You see, to Christensen, basketball was fun. It wasn’t her life; it wasn’t everything she wanted. To her, she saw it as an opportunity to get what she wanted: an education.</p>\n<p>“I knew with five kids in my family that if I wanted a college education I needed to provide it myself and, to me, basketball was always just a tool for that,” Christensen said. “I [am] really fortunate that basketball has shaped everything in my life, and when I look back the one thing that sticks out to me is when you want something you figure out a way to get it and basketball was a tool to get what I wanted and it all worked out.”</p>\n<p>When the final buzzer sounded on Christensen’s last game here at UCSB it seemed as though her mind was already made up to not try to play professionally. Like many athletes, her goal was achieved the day she received her degree, not the day she got drafted.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately depending how you look at it, basketball wasn’t done with Christensen.</p>\n<p>“I remember the coaching staff fighting really hard for me to even get an invite to the combine camp in Chicago, and, unfortunately, that’s one of the things about playing in a small conference … You don’t get a lot of the credit you deserve even though we were a national power here at Santa Barbara all my time here,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>Despite the effort it took just to earn her a chance at the combine, once the Lakeview, Ore. native was seen by scouts, she managed to catch the attention of a few.</p>\n<p>“Draft day — I really didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t think I was going to get drafted, and when I did get drafted by Phoenix I didn’t realize that it is really difficult to make a team,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>On the evening of the WNBA’s seventh draft since its inception, Christensen was drafted in the third round as the 40th overall selection by the Phoenix Mercury, and just like that, she had an opportunity of a lifetime fall into her lap, playing in a professional league.</p>\n<p>As with everything she had done in her life thus far, the former Big West All-Freshman did what she had done her whole life, work hard. To her credit, she did something not many people of that draft class can say, she made a WNBA roster.</p>\n<p>“I remember going through the cut process, and on the last day I went to the practice facility and I asked a veteran, ‘How do we know if we made the final roster?’ and she looked at me and said, ‘You’re here aren’t you?’ and I remember thinking how unceremonious it all was,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>“But then I realized I was one of 12 rookies to actually make a roster, even everyone that was selected in the first round [16 players] didn’t make a team, so that’s when I realized how uncommon it was that I wound up in the WNBA and I was able to play a long time.”</p>\n<p>Cut short due to injury, Christensen’s time in the WNBA lasted six years, and after that the UCSB classics graduate now had to search for a new job and pursue a new career, something that did not take long.</p>\n<p>“At the end of what would be my last season because of my injury, I went down to L.A. and did an open call with 200 other people for this position for the Kings as a halftime and post-game reporter, and I ended up getting this great job,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>That leads us to the current day, where Christensen will be inducted into the Santa Barbara Basketball Court of Champions sometime later this weekend, an honor that has been bestowed upon some of the best individuals that have come from the city of Santa Barbara, both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“When you look at the names in that group, it’s a real big deal, an honor for sure,” Christensen said. “I think the great thing about the Santa Barbara Court of Champions is that it covers people and things that have made an impact not just in sports, but also in the community and that means a lot to me.”</p>\n<p>Christensen is a perfect example of what most of us college students want, a motor that drives us to keep grinding away until we get what we want. Of course, luck comes into play in some stages of life, but overall, what gives us opportunities is the work ethic we show on a day to day basis.</p>\n<p>Christensen was like us at one point, a college student who had no idea what she was going to do with the rest of her life. She had ideas, but like what happens with most people, life took over, and she rolled with the punches taking advantage of every single opportunity given to her and it all started with one decision, coming to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I said I have gotten lucky, but I’ve also worked my ass off. This work ethic is something I have carried with me throughout my life and they want people that have that work ethic around them,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>“I made a very pure decision to go to Santa Barbara. Every Pac-10 [now Pac-12] school except Stanford recruited me, but I chose Santa Barbara from the Big West. I didn’t know it was a big deal, but I made it because I felt like it was a place people would care about me and what I would be in my life.”</p>\n<p>Whether you are a senior about to graduate or a freshman just finishing up your first year as a full-time student, do not panic. The same applies for student-athletes concerned with finding their niche outside the sport they’ve played for the majority of their lives.</p>\n<p>As students, we must keep in mind that being a student doesn’t define our future, but rather it is the next step toward discovering our purpose, which has no definite pathway. Work hard, and stay humble, just like our favorite forward from the years 1998-2002, Kayte Christensen.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
