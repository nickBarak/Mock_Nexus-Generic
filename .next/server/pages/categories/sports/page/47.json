Irvine came out of the gates with an aggressive mentality that UCSB was not able to match, and it was redshirt senior Noel Baham who started the scoring off for the Anteaters with a header off of a beautifully placed cross by freshman forward Sydney Carr. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Carr and Baham would play huge parts in the game, with the former scoring two goals and notching an assist while the latter got two assists to go with her goal. Carr, who won the first Big West offensive player of the week award after the game, scored the second goal of the game off of a cross from Baham to put UCI up 2-0 at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos did start off better in the second half, and their increased intensity led to a goal in the 60th minute by forward Christine Maurer. The freshman, who has four goals and one assist on the year, snuck through the back line of the defense and was able to score off of a cross from midfielder Shaelan Murison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was not able to build off that goal however as three minutes later the Anteaters widened the gap to two yet again off of an easy goal for freshman Claire Grouwinkel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos answered with a flurry of shots and corner kicks, however, none found their mark, and by the time Sydney Carr scored a goal directly off of a corner to put UCI up 4-1 the game had already been all but over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like the Riverside game before, the Gauchos actually kept up on the offensive end with the Anteaters. Irvine only had one more shot than UCSB and UCSB actually had more corner kicks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What separated the two teams was both the quality of shots that they got and the Gauchos inability to take advantage of the opportunities they created. The fact the UCSB created those opportunities in the first place is a good sign, especially against the top-ranked team in the conference, but they’re going to have to finish if they want to win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to making sure that a loss like the one that happened on Sunday doesn’t happen again will be taking advantage of all the opportunities they get.</span></p>\n<p>The Gauchos next match is against Cal State Northridge Thursday, October 5  at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The capitalized opportunity for UCR gave the team an early lead, 1-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasted no time in trying to get an equalizer, multiple plays by freshman No. 9 Rodney Michael and sophomore No. 13 Ignacio Tellechea lead to the Gauchos being able to take good shots on goal, forcing the UC Riverside keeper Vincent Morales to make plays in front of the net.</p>\n<p>The unsuccessful scoring opportunities lead to UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg making changes in the 33rd minute, substituting No. 13 Ignacio Tellechea and No. 10 Noah Billingsley for No. 17 Derek Kryzda and No. 21 Alex Liua.</p>\n<p>The newly brought in duo of Kryzda and Liua were quickly able to maneuver the offense and create some close chances for the Gauchos. It was in the 37th minute where Liua found himself in the right place to receive a bounce off a UCR defender that went left of the box. Liua was able to perfectly send the ball over the keeper’s head and into the corner of the net to leave the game all tied up at halftime.</p>\n<p>It was in the 37th minute where Liua found himself in the right place to receive a bounce off a UCR defender that went left of the box.

The forward took a shot from the left side of the box and floated the ball over the keeper’s head and into the right corner of the net.</p>\n<p>UCR stayed in the game and would occasionally get through the UCSB defense, but the Highlanders were unable to find a way into the net throughout the second half and any shot on goal was either saved or cleared away. The Highlanders were more often finding themselves in their own end trying to prevent the game from getting too ahead of them.</p>\n<p>The defense for the Highlanders finally lapsed in the final five minutes of the game, allowing Gaucho forward Rodney Michael to run past two defenders into the right side of the box and sending a shot past the goalkeeper that was buried into the left corner of the net, allowing the game to end in a 3-1 UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB players Rodney Michael, Ignacio Tellechea, and Alex Liua continue to work well in the offense through making the correct passes and being able to finish the opportunities presented in front of the net, a great sign for a team looking to establish itself early on in the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Thursday, October 5 at the Cal State Northridge where the Matadors will be playing the Gauchos at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/","id":1399,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1398,1397,1396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Strong Second-Half Leads Gauchos Past Titans in Big West Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling behind early, the Gauchos scored four unanswered goals to shock CSUF 5-2 in their conference opener.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Harder Stadium was booming Thursday night as the UCSB men’s soccer team hosted Cal State Fullerton for its conference season opener.

A 1-0 record is how every team wishes to start their new year, but the Gauchos will surely try to remain undefeated as they immediately game plan for a newly 0-1 UC Riverside team.</p>\n<p>Early on into Thursday’s match, both sides look fairly even as offenses went back and forth at each other’s keepers.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 15<sup>th</sup> minute of play when UCSB conceded the first of the match to Fullerton’s top goal scorer, midfielder Ross McPhie. The goal came off a 1 on 1 from the sideline where the Fullerton winger crossed the ball on the floor. The pass skidded perfectly to McPhie and rebounded off his deflection and into the goal.</p>\n<p>For the next half hour or so all seemed to be going in Fullerton’s favor. Then, in the 40<sup>th</sup> minute, UCSB forward Derek Kryzda was subbed in and made an immediate impact by netting in the equalizer for the ‘Chos. After another sideline attack and impressive nutmeg, Kryzda was on the receiving end of a beautifully set pass and connected from the left of the goalkeeper’s box.</p>\n<p>It was halftime now and most fans were still breathless from the immense cheering before the half. Following the 2<sup>nd</sup> kickoff, momentum still seemed to favor Fullerton. Then, off a cross from about 30 yards out, the ball somehow managed to find itself in the back of Santa Barbara’s net due to the players and keeper’s distraction from a positional battle.</p>\n<p>Hopes plummeted once more, but for hardly any time as UCSB found a response about a half minute later. The Gaucho offense surged forward as Fullerton’s back field seemed lackadaisical following their team’s score. After a quick play from the wing the Gauchos also found a lucky ricochet for themselves and evened the score once again.</p>\n<p>From here on out the match was very one sided as UCSB began to net in what appeared to be every chance they got. Each shot on goal was also finished magisterially as forward Ignacio Tellechea curled one in from the corner area, defender Adrian Adames chipped in a save from around the 18 yard line, and midfielder Michael Rodney nestled in the final goal of the night on the keeper’s strong side.</p>\n<p>With a final score of 5-2, the Gauchos truly showed their colors and found an offensive formation that can work in the future. Now they’ll try to extend their record to 2-0 and hopefully establish a home streak that opponents can fear.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against UC Riverside this Saturday, September 30<sup>th</sup>, in Harder Stadium at approximately 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/","id":1396,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1395,1394,1393],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stay Woke!

I guess you can say I simply wrote from my heart because it’s just so saddening that a little over a year later, I find myself expressing similar sentiments to the Colin Kaepernick article I wrote. The former NFL quarterback’s initial call to action was his decision to sit on the bench during the National Anthem prior to electing to kneel in future games.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Kaepernick’s protest was to combat racial inequality and social injustice, as he stated, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, Sept. 22, at a rally for Alabama Republican Senate candidate Luther Strange, President Donald Trump suggested that NFL owners should demand to “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’’ in reference to players who have selected to kneel and protest during the anthem.</p>\n<p>As various players responded to his claims via social media, voicing their indifferences and unsurprised reactions, Trump followed up with a series of tweets days after the rally, generally stating that sports fans and this country will not condone players protesting the flag.</p>\n<p>As both a black man and a sports fan, Trump’s statements were no surprise to me as well.</p>\n<p>Although I am disappointed and sickened by such remarks, I feel like I’ve become numb to hearing such irrational and hate-filled words. It’s expected, especially when considering the fact that Trump and others who believe that players are disrespecting the flag do not see the bigger issue at hand.</p>\n<p>The larger issue at hand is that black people and people of color are not treated equally in this country. Nonetheless, this racial inequality isn’t being acknowledged but rather minimized by being framed as a threat to America and its flag.</p>\n<p>For people to mistake Kaepernick’s protest as being aimed at disrespecting the flag or military goes to show why movements such as Black Lives Matter are so relevant, especially as I witness people get more upset over athletes deciding to peacefully protest rather than the innocent lives that are taken on a yearly basis.</p>\n<p>It’s crazy to think how quick fans are to forgive and forget a player’s troubles with domestic violence, substance abuse violations or performance enhancement violations. While I do believe in second chances for certain circumstances, even for the aforementioned cases, to an extent, the fact that race is viewed as a topic that does not belong in connection to sports is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>It is time for us all to wake up!</p>\n<p>No, I do not have a specific solution to end racial inequality. But I do believe that the first step toward making progress begins with acknowledging and combating racism in order to overcome the taboo nature that has made it such a cringe-worthy topic.</p>\n<p>Doing so means that systemic ideologies such as colorblindness, in which we’ve been told that race and skin color don’t matter or that we live in a meritocratic society where everyone is on a level playing field and must put in the work to reach a certain level of so-called “success,” are things that must be stripped of their manipulative powers.</p>\n<p>Excuses that athletes need to “stick to sports” because of the amount of money they make and other claims that discredit today’s protests are just detractors from working towards unity.</p>\n<p>This is why I remain so proud of the NFL athletes who genuinely took a knee or protested in another manner this past Sunday. While I don’t believe that all players who demonstrated a protest were sincere, such actions were significant because, although immediate results will not show, an impact is still gradually being made.</p>\n<p>Whether it ever reaches him or not, I just want to say thank you to Colin Kaepernick for protesting and setting the precedent for what exists today in providing a voice for the voiceless concerning racial inequality. He wasn’t the first and he won’t be the last, but his impact is profound and will last forever.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, my mood is precisely expressed by Detroit Lions’ tight end Eric Ebron:</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_78874\" style=\"width: 619px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=78874\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-78874\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78874\" data-attachment-id=\"78874\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/screen-shot-2017-09-27-at-9-28-40-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=1288%2C618&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1288,618\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2017-09-27 at 9.28.40 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=888%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-78874\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM-1024x491.png?resize=609%2C292\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=1024%2C491&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=768%2C368&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?w=1288&amp;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tweet Courtesy of Eric Ebron, @Ebron85</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A keynote to still keep in mind, however, would be their goal count, as the Titans put up a very productive 10 goals in nine games.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78849\" style=\"width: 513px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-15_stephenmanga_msoccer-3-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78849\" data-attachment-id=\"78849\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/2017-09-15_stephenmanga_msoccer-3-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-78849\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=503%2C336\" alt=\"\" width=\"503\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78849\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rodney Michael steals the ball from the opposing team. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB has had its fair share of struggles. The Gauchos are currently below .500 following some inconsistent non-conference performances, which in most part were due to their lack of goal production, as they only scored five goals in eight matches.</p>\n<p>The greatest positive for UCSB has been its recent undefeated stretch. That being said, those wins all took place at home and are a part of a current five-game homestay that will conclude this weekend. One thing’s for certain: Both teams will undoubtedly wish to keep their winning ways by upsetting the other’s momentum early.</p>\n<p>A clear key player to be observed on the Titans’ end is junior midfielder, Ross McPhie. With a respectable four goals and one assist on the year, McPhie’s production, or lack thereof, may very well be the deciding factor for the Gauchos come Thursday night.</p>\n<p>As his club’s leading goal scorer, he has also been on a roll lately with three goals in his last four starts. Not to mention, he also netted the match’s only goal last week for the Titans’ 1-0 victory over UNLV. The Gaucho coaching staff will surely keep McPhie in their sights while creating the game plan.</p>\n<p>The potential for Gaucho glory Thursday, however, may very well still be in reach from a defensive viewpoint. Over the last two matches, UCSB has only allowed one score, which occurred from its exhibition match versus Club America’s U-20 team. Similarly, Fullerton has only allowed two scores in its past four games, as they’ll try to stop UCSB’s own leading goal scorer, sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, the Gauchos vs. Titans conference matchup has favored the former, as Thursday’s home side UCSB leads with a 31-26-3 series record. Currently, however, Santa Barbara is ranked last in the Big West Northern standings due to their low win percentage of .375.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal State Fullerton boasts a .611 and sits atop the Big West South with the best overall record. While significant, what matters most will officially begin Thursday with conference play.</p>\n<p>Kickoff between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton starts Thursday, Sept. 28, at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 28, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/","id":1395,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1394,1393,1392],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Sports and Politics Must Mix: Introducing Uncomfortability","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kaepernick-art-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kaepernick-art-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Daily Nexus sports writer Omar Hernandez explores the reality of the sports and political world and analyzes the viewpoints that have hurt and helped those discussions.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Almost exactly one year ago, Colin Kaepernick made the decision to sit during the national anthem at a 49ers pre-season game. Although portrayed as a rash, attention-seeking maneuver by much of the press, the truth is actually quite the opposite. Kaepernick had been auditing classes at CAL with the guidance of doctoral candidate Ameer Hasan Loggins and reading up on the teachings of Frantz Fanon and Patricia Hill for months before the protest. Yet he was still depicted as ignorant by some and as cluelessly abrasive by many.</p>\n<p>The protest lit up the media headlines like wildfire. Here was a young black athlete shunning one of the hallmarks of both American society and the sports world to call attention to the injustices that people of color continue to face in this country, which was not unprecedented considering the actions of a sports icon such as Muhammad Ali, who refused being inducted into the army in 1967 in defense of his civil rights. But it still felt shocking.</p>\n<p>The reactions to Kaepernick’s protest were varied, from claims that he was “disrespecting the flag” to the eventual dismissal of his message because he was not a starter on his team. However, one of the most popular oppositional viewpoints was that he, and athletes as a whole, should “just stick to sports.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Athletes such as Allen Iverson and Michael Jordan have established themselves in domains that are typically considered outside the boundaries of the playing field/court. Jordan created a streetwear empire and A.I. gave countless young black and brown kids the confidence and swagger to represent themselves and their cultures unabashedly.</p>\n<p>They were not exempt from the stigma or restrictions that usually accompany emphatic expressions of blackness; however, Iverson learned the hard way when his style of dress was used as the basis for a racially tinged dress code established by the NBA at the height of his career. The fact that athletes themselves have the unique power to capture the minds of such a large audience while operating in the institution of sports (that, just like any other large institution, is marred with the racism and discrimination of its society) is reflected in the rich history of activism as well as the dark past of discrimination that has been a part of all sports since their inception.</p>\n<p>The usage of sports as a conductor for social justice is not a new or novel concept, as exemplified from the gladiator uprisings of Ancient Rome to John Carlos and Tommie Smith raising their fists at the 1968 Summer Olympics. It is not too surprising that the “stick to sports” crowd is ignorant of just how antithetical that statement is to the core of what sports are or have been. However, it is not just ignorance that compels people to spout this backward thinking. There is a deep-seated sense of pain and discomfort for many white Americans in seeing this activism that is often not talked about but is rooted in the dehumanization of the black athlete.</p>\n<p>We all mythologize athletes. Sports fans often will often talk about how basketball or football is an escape for them, a game that takes them away from the harshness of the real world. Athletes are the vessels for our hopes, our dreams, even our insecurities.</p>\n<p>We rely on their labor for our entertainment; however, when their humanity interrupts or overshadows this very same entertainment, fans face a conundrum.</p>\n<p>We must strip athletes of most of their identity or personhood because if athletes are humanized, then the illusion is shattered. Many white fans don’t want to look at the face of their favorite athlete and see blackness. I don’t mean phenotypic brown and black skin but rather the deep-seated pain of a people who have been oppressed for centuries.</p>\n<p>Michael Jordan understood this very well. As the famous story goes, when asked why he didn’t speak up more for social causes, Jordan answered, “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” When Michael Bennett or Thabo Sefolosha speaks up against the police brutality they’ve encountered, or when Kaepernick elaborates on the school-to-prison pipeline, many sports fans are forced, for the first time, to truly look at these athletes as black and at just how much that affects their lives.</p>\n<p>These athletes can no longer be everyone’s vessel, because to be a vessel is to be empty, to be neutral, and in the face of institutionalized racism and violence, neutrality is impossible. It is hard for many white fans to understand this because it is not what they were taught. Sports is supposed to be a meritocracy, a great equalizer, but the truth is that meritocracy in our current state is just another facade.</p>\n<p>The institution of sports in which one group, white men, predominantly has ownership of another group, black men, can never be equal unless it’s changed, just as the institution of politics in which one group has historically made all the laws can never be equitable as well.</p>\n<p>It then makes sense why the rallying cry is not “racism doesn’t exist” but “stick to sports,” because to admit the reality, that these black athletes are intelligent, that they do have a strong pride in their identity and that the institution of sports is not exempt but rather perpetuates the very same racism that is rampant in this country, would then force fans to disrupt the status quo, to have to take action, and for too many white fans, being comfortable is more important than working toward justice.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the biggest reason that the reaction toward kneeling and activism in sports has been so visceral and negative is not Trump, it’s not the military and “patriotism,” and it’s certainly not that athletes aren’t able to articulate their positions effectively. The reason is that, just like any other time a racial injustice is brought to the forefront of the national conversation, it is making those who find comfort in white supremacy uncomfortable. What athletes and other political activists know, however, is that change only comes from discomfort, and if “mixing” sports and politics is what is causing this discomfort, then that means we are on the right track.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 28, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

team, and that means it now turns its attention to single day matches, beginning with a meeting against former MPSF rival, No. 3 Cal.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos head into this home matchup boasting an 8-4 overall record; however, they have been dropping in the national rankings due to losses to Long Beach State and UC Irvine, now ranked sixth and seventh, respectively.</p>\n<p>Cal has had another great start to the year and currently sits at 11-1. The Golden Bears came into this season as the top-ranked team in the nation after winning their 14th national title last season but recently dropped due to a 9-8 loss to UCLA at the MPSF Invitational, finishing third at the tournament. The Gauchos finished ninth in that same invite last weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>History does not bode well for Santa Barbara when facing Cal, continually one of the best programs in Division-I water polo, as it has a career record of 8-67 against the Golden Bears. The last time the Gauchos defeated the defending champs was on Sept. 17, 2004, in a 7-6 double-overtime victory at Cal.</p>\n<p>Recent history has not been so demoralizing, however, as UCSB was within one goal of defeating Cal this year and lost 8-7 at the Triton Invitation in its first weekend of action.</p>\n<p>Hoping to pull off the upset, the Gauchos will be looking to rely on their goal-scoring trio made up of senior Shane Hauschild, junior Boris Jovanovic, and sophomore Ivan Gvozdanovic.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the most experienced and the leader of the team, Hauschild has been the most consistent force for UCSB over his last four years. Over the past three seasons, the attacker has totaled 103 goals, 40 behind the 10th most in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara, Calif. native has scored 17 goals on the year, third-best mark on the team, and scored two against Cal in the first meeting this season, making him the only Gaucho to have multiple goals in that game. He leads the team in steals with 10.</p>\n<p>Jovanovic, a driver, currently is second on the team in goals with 18 and second in total points accumulated with 28 thanks to his 10 assists; he is tied for the best mark on the team with Hauschild.</p>\n<p>Gvozdanovic has been the biggest surprise for the Gauchos this year, as he has been on fire with his team-leading 21 goals on the season and 28 points scored. The utility played in all 26 games last year, scoring 24 goals and earning himself an all-conference honorable mention, but he has much improved from one season to the next, as he is only three goals away from tying last season’s mark.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the Golden Bears definitely have no lack of talent on the offensive side of the ball. While UCSB currently has one goal scorer above 20 on the season, Cal has three of them combining for 73 of the team’s total 163 goals — nearly 45 percent.</p>\n<p>Senior attacker Luca Cupido currently leads the team in scoring with 27 goals on the season, just three short of tying his entire total from last season. Despite that, Cupido made one of the biggest shots in program history as he nailed a long distance strike just before the end of the first overtime in last year’s National Championship match against USC.</p>\n<p>Last season also appeared to be an outlier for the Italian native as he scored 42 and 43 goals in 2014 and 2015, respectively.</p>\n<p>Juniors Odysseas Masmanidis and Johnny Hooper are second and third on the team in goals with 24 and 22, respectively. Hooper has led the team in goals the last two seasons with 74 in 2015 and 75 in 2016.</p>\n<p>With the invitational season finally done, this is the part of the season that will show what this year’s UCSB team is made of. Last year, the Gauchos upset No. 5 Stanford, which helped them eventually get to the No. 4 ranking in the nation, their highest ranking in the polls since 1990.</p>\n<p>One thing is for certain: If Santa Barbara wants to be taken as seriously as it was last year, especially later in the season, it needs signature wins, and what better way to do that than beating a talented program that it hasn’t bested in over a decade?</p>\n<p>No. 8 UCSB takes on No. 3 Cal at noon on Saturday, Sept. 30, at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In order to maintain that level, they will have to continue to keep diversifying their attack, which is something they did a great job of in Denver, where seven players had double-digit shot numbers.</p>\n<p>Going up against UC Riverside will be a great opportunity for UCSB to refine its offensive skills, seeing as the Highlanders’ defense has been known to be weak at times. UCR has given up twice as many goals on almost the same amount of shots compared to their opponents while shooting at a much lower percentage on average. If the Gauchos are able to replicate at least some of their performance from last game they should be able to score early and often.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, UCSB will be looking to continue the stalwart defensive effort that has led to four shutouts so far this year. Again, this matchup should be less of a challenge and more of a chance to improve for the home squad as they have only surrendered more than two goals once this season. Senior defender Kate Shoemaker’s plays have been useful in maintaining the integrity of the defense, and her experience and leadership make for a much more efficient team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos should prepare to strike first and keep the energy up, which, this year, has not been easy. UCSB actually has a better record on the road than at home so far, but building up and feeding off the home crowd will be an essential component for the team heading into the later stages of the year.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside has been abysmal on the road this year, coming into the game with a 1-4-1 record when they are away, so the Gauchos have to be able to capitalize on home field advantage.</p>\n<p>According to the stats, UCSB should be able to win against UCR, as they are a lower-ranked opponent. However, it is crucial that the Gauchos not underestimate UCR.</p>\n<p>Early season wins might seem irrelevant as the Big West tournament is months away, but starting off strong and focusing on self-improvement is essential to keeping UCSB on a path to success.</p>\n<p>Kick-off between the Gauchos and the Highlanders is at 7 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 29, at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Sept. 28, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The mark was their best finish to the non-conference schedule since the 2005 season in which they went 10-1.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was swept in the regular season by UCR in 2016, yet managed to sweep the Titans in both meetings. UCSB hasn’t lost to Fullerton since Oct. 19, 2012.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s mix of experienced returners and newcomers has been the most evident culprit of the team’s inconsistencies of maintain leads, minimizing errors, and closing out matches.</p>\n<p>But there’s no ceiling on the Gauchos’ potential as they continue to gel and establish familiarity on the court. Their last match was a sign of that as UCSB recorded a season-high .330 hitting clip and season-low 15 errors in its 3-1 win over Eastern Kentucky.</p>\n<p>Although conference matches lie ahead, gradually paving her way toward becoming a possible Big West Player of the Year candidate after winning Freshman of the Year honors last season is sophomore Lindsey Ruddins. She finished with a season-high .415 hitting percentage in the win against EKU along with 20 kills.</p>\n<p>Ruddins’ consistency at the outside hitter position has led to her becoming one of the nation’s top players. UCSB’s kills leader at 168, the Gauchos’ star player is second in the nation in attacks per set with a 14.09 average.</p>\n<p>Her productivity matches her constant attacks as her 5.25 kills per set average also ranks second in the country. Topping off her placement in the national ranks is her 5.55 points per set average, which is sixth-best.</p>\n<p>Despite Ruddins absence in the team’s 3-1 loss to Cleveland State the past weekend, making a positive statement was freshman middle blocker Nicole Omwanghe. She ended the tournament’s final two matches with a combined total of 22 kills and a .486 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Omwanghe notched a career-high 13 kills to go along with a .435 hitting percentage against Cleveland St. and finished with nine kills and a .571 clip against Eastern Kentucky.</p>\n<p>Sustaining such offensive success heading into Friday’s match against UCR will be no easy feat. The Highlanders are tied with Hawaii for the Big West lead in opponent hitting percentage at a .171 clip, which is greater than the Gauchos’ season average of .155.</p>\n<p>Helping set the foundation to UCR’s stout defense is its ability to defend and earn digs. Riverside owns a conference-leading 17.51 digs per set average to also rank 19<sup>th</sup> in the nation.</p>\n<p>Playing a factor in the Highlanders’ defensive success and making an immediate impact early in her career has been redshirt freshman libero Nicole Rodriguez. Having already earned Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors back in Aug. 20-27, Rodriguez was recently rewarded with conference Freshman of the Week honors for her strong performance at the Denver Invitational.</p>\n<p>In three matches, she accumulated a team-high 46 digs and five aces while also tying her career-high of 23 digs in UCR’s 3-2 win over San Diego State. Rodriguez’ 4.39 digs per set and 180 (update after match) total digs rank fourth and seventh in the Big West, respectively.</p>\n<p>As Rodriguez helps set the stage on defense, aiding the Highlanders on offense is junior setter Chelsea Doyle.</p>\n<p>Doyle was named to the Denver Invitational All-Tournament team after tallying 101 assists on the weekend and 37 digs. Her 11.07 assists per set average ranks second in the Big West and 31<sup>st</sup> in the nation.</p>\n<p>UCSB must find a way to be consistent when attacking on offense in order to have a chance against UCR’s defense.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, UCSB is a little more evenly matched in its matchup against Cal State Fullerton. The Titans are one spot ahead of UCSB in hitting percentage at .158, but are stronger on defense as opponents average a .183 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Similar to UCR, Cal State Fullerton makes it difficult for opposing teams to establish an efficient attack due to their defensive prowess, specifically their success at digs.</p>\n<p>Fullerton lands at No. 3 in the Big West in digs per set with a 15.92 average. However, the Gauchos rank just one spot below the Titans at 15.59 digs per set, setting the stage for a likely defensive battle that each team will look to turn digs, blocks, and opponent errors into points.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s conference opening weekend will begin with UC Riverside this Fri., Sept. 22 at 7 p.m. and will continue Saturday versus Cal State Fullerton Saturday, Sept. 23 at 7 p.m. Both matches will be played at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78835\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-20/gaucos-set-to-begin-big-west-conf-play-vs-ucr-csfu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78835\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-20/gaucos-set-to-begin-big-west-conf-play-vs-ucr-csfu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-20/gaucos-set-to-begin-big-west-conf-play-vs-ucr-csfu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-20/gaucos-set-to-begin-big-west-conf-play-vs-ucr-csfu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-20/gaucos-set-to-begin-big-west-conf-play-vs-ucr-csfu/","id":4954,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4953,4952,4951],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain Winless After Three Tough Losses in Annual Thunderdome Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-09-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is now 0-9 on the season after suffering three losses in its annual tournament, the Thunderdome Classic, to Yale, No. 19 USC and Arkansas.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite coming home for its time this season, the UCSB women’s volleyball team struggled in its annual Thunderdome Classic, dropping all three of its matches to opponents Yale, No.19 USC, and Arkansas.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 0-9 early this season but have yet to participate in Big West Conference play which is set to begin on Friday, September 22.

Her 13 kills in the third set alone led the Gauchos to a victory after coming back from an early 7-1 deficit, but even though she was a driving force in putting up a team total of 60 kills compared to Yale’s collective 56, her dominance was not quite enough to take the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB closed out the evening facing USC (7-2) for its second match of the day, but with four of the six Gaucho starters out due to injury, the Trojans made quick work of the home team with scores 15-25, 16-25, 20-25 to give the No. 19 team in the country a quick 3-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite USC putting up a .389 kill percentage while UCSB presented a measly .074, Santa Barbara’s defense enhanced notably by the third set of the match. The Gauchos strongly recorded five team blocks and forced the previously errorless Trojans from the first two sets to make nine attack errors. They even turned around and tied the third set at 17-all, but after a USC timeout, the visitors’ went on an 8-3 run to finish it.</p>\n<p>Despite not being able to have a chance to win their own tournament, Saturday’s match against Arkansas still meant a lot to a Gaucho team that was still in search of their first win of the season.</p>\n<p>The match was a tense five-set competition full of action. After some grappling on day one of the tournament, UCSB really played some of its best volleyball against the Razorbacks but was just shy of the win, losing the match 3-2 with set scores of 25-16, 20-25, 19-25, 25-21, 11-15.</p>\n<p>The first set was particularly outstanding for the Gauchos as they routed a deciding score of 25-16 thanks to a hot .480 kill percentage with five kills from Ruddins, who ended the match with 24 total, three aces, and four blocks while Arkansas served zero aces and put up zero blocks.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB then lost sets two and three 20-25 and 19-25 to give the Razorbacks the advantage going into the fourth set, but they battled back to stay alive and win the fourth 25-21.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final set to 15 points came to an 8-8 tie, but Arkansas’ back-to-back kills from Pilar Victoria and Elizabeth Pamphile gave them the momentum to go on a 5-2 run with three more kills from Victoria to decide the final set at 15-11.</p>\n<p>It was a heartbreaking loss for the women of Santa Barbara, but their solid performance throughout the match demonstrated a great deal of team cohesion and improvement. One could only hope that UCSB will be able to turn those positives into a win soon, especially before Big West play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be heading to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania this upcoming weekend to compete in another four-team tournament, the Pitt Panther Challenge, beginning Friday, Septemeber 15 and concluding Saturday, Septemeber 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/","id":5493,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[5492,5491,5490],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Participate in Utah State Invitation Searching For First Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team’s travels continue as it will take on another slate of away matches against Montana St., the University of Pacific, and Utah State at the Utah State Invitational i...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team’s travels continue as it will take on another slate of away matches against Montana St., the University of Pacific, and Utah State at the Utah State Invitational in hopes of shaking its current 0-3 winless start to the season.</p>\n<p>Each team participating in the tournament has at least one loss thus far as Montana St. sits at 1-2, Pacific is 2-2 and hopes to extend its two-match winning streak, all while the hosting Aggies are 2-1.</p>\n<p>In addition to looking for its first win, UCSB has an opportunity to help Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch reach the 300 career wins landmark.

Whether it be service, attacking or blocking errors, Santa Barbara has had its fair share of self-inflicting mistakes on both sides of the net as it is responsible for a conference-leading 84 errors.</p>\n<p>A majority of these miscues can be attributed to the Gauchos’ mix of experienced and newcomer players adjusting to one another so only time will tell. UCSB is is need of its role players to emerge when opponents begin to key in on it pair of strikers.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the gameplay, containing the streaky start of Gauchos’ outside hitters Lindsay Ruddins and Chloe Allen will be a challenging task.</p>\n<p>Big players step up in big games and Ruddins did exactly that in UCSB’s five-set clash against the No. 15 Florida St. Seminoles last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Ruddins outshined the competition with a career-high 36 kills performance to earn the second all-time slot in UCSB history for single-match kills, two short of former Gaucho Roberta Gehlke’s all-time record of 38 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s redshirt second-year outside stud holds this season’s NCAA-high in single-match kills. Ruddins achievement of the 36 kills mark is a feat that no more than three players have recorded in a match in the past four seasons.</p>\n<p>However, Ruddins did not play in the Gauchos’ last outing against Baylor due to undisclosed reasoning.</p>\n<p>Complementing Ruddins success is Allen, who is coming into her own to begin the season. Already embracing a larger role in her sophomore year, Allen made a splurge facing the Florida St. as well with a career-high 24 kills to complete her double-double of 15 digs. She is the only Gaucho with at least two double-figure kills totals in a match.</p>\n<p>Such momentous play should help further establish the Gauchos search for offensive rhythm. While underestimating an opponent is never a wise judgment, UCSB’s first matchup of the tournament against Montana St. may be the perfect ‘pick me up’ to get things rolling.</p>\n<p>Overlooking the Bobcats would be dangerous as they possess a veteran roster in which 13 of the team’s 16 players have been in the program for two years or less; it is a class that includes six freshmen.</p>\n<p>Currently one match victory away from the .500 mark, Montana St. will hope to steer itself onto a winning track as the history of past seasons have been daunting.</p>\n<p>The Bobcats have not had a winning season since 2012-13, in which they went 15-14, 9-11 in Big Sky play, and have not surpassed more than seven wins since then.</p>\n<p>It has been a process of rebuilding for MSU as former Assistant Coach Daniel Jones is now serving as the program’s interim Head Coach. Making things a little easier for Jones and his staff on the court is the trio of outside hitters the program has.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the triad is a young and fairly fresh group consisting of freshman Evi Wilson alongside sophomores Chase Doughty and Natalie Passeck. Each has at least 20+ kills, providing MSU with an array of scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Aside from the points scored at the net, it has been the little things that have worked to the advantage of the Bobcats as well. Leading them has been freshman libero Alexis Goroski, and her success from behind the service line.</p>\n<p>MSU recorded 21 service aces in its season opening weekend, making it 33<sup>rd</sup> in the nation in the statistical category. Goroski’s eight service aces tie her for 20<sup>th</sup> in the nation and second in the Big Sky Conference.</p>\n<p>While kills, blocks, and digs typically are the most important advantage to pursue as a team, it seems like the minor dimensions of the match such as errors, service aces and more will determine how both UCSB and Montana St. perform <span data-term=\"goog_785148202\">on Friday</span>.</p>\n<p>The weekend will continue and conclude with doubleheader matches against Pacific and host Utah St.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss of one of the program’s best players in school history, Lexi Elman, who joined U.S. Olympian Elaina Oden as one of only two Tiger players ever to notch 1,200 or more career kills and digs; Pacific has held its own through four matches.</p>\n<p>The Tigers are currently on a two-match winning streak and has been striking the ball with no hesitation to much success. In three of its four matches, Pacific has hit at least a .300+ clip, the highest being .430 in its sweep of Idaho last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, it is a home opening weekend for the Aggies. Utah St. opened its non-conference schedule at the Arkansas Classic.</p>\n<p>Helping guide the Aggies to consecutive wins in the team’s first two matches was senior outside Lauren Anderson.</p>\n<p>Her totals of 41 kills, 4.10 kills per set average, 18 digs, five blocks and five service aces led Utah St. to the tournament’s finale as Anderson was selected to the Arkansas Classis All-Tournament team. She fell one kill short of tying her career-high of 23 kills in a win over Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Montana St. at <span data-term=\"goog_785148203\">3 p.m.</span> on Friday, Sept.1.

It lost to No. 15 Florida St. (3-0) by a narrow 3-2 margin.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">UCSB experienced inconsistencies on the offensive end in both matches as it ended with a combined .0135 hitting average, concluding with a .036 hitting percentage against Illinois St. and -.009 against the Bears. Still, it was an impressive opening weekend on defense for junior libero Emilia Petrachi as she wrapped up the three-day tourney with 54 kills and a 4.91 digs per set average.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Three of UCSB’s four freshmen – middle blockers Nicole Omwanghe, Kija Rivers, and Amanda Serex – played in the team’s season-opening match. Experimentation with the rotation continued as senior libero Sydney Bast made her debut as an outside hitter while facing Baylor. The Gauchos’ co-captain finished with a team-high nine kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">A five-set battle between the Gauchos and Seminoles was UCSB’s best showing before falling short of an upset victory. Despite the team’s loss, the career-topping performances of redshirt sophomore and true sophomore outside hitters Ashley Ruddins and Chloe Allen were amazing to witness as a fan of either team.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The 2016 Big West Freshman of the Year and All-Big West First Team selection, Ruddins further etched her name in program history on Saturday. The star outside hitter set a rally-scoring era record for single-match kills with 36 against Florida St., falling two kills short of tying former Gaucho Roberta Gehlke’s school record 38 kills against Long Beach State on Sept. 30, 1999.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Now a starter to begin the year after a fairly quite freshman season, Allen has capitalized on her increased playing time and was valuable in the Gauchos’ ability to keep the score close against the Seminoles. She notched a new career-high of 24 kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Along with being the only Gauchos to record double figures in kills, both Ruddins and Allen ended the match with double-doubles with 18 and 15 digs, respectively.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Constant back-and-forth scoring summed up the first two sets of the Gaucho-Seminole matchup. While tied 9-9, Florida St. embarked on an 8-2 run that would shift the momentum and give it some breathing room to eventually close out the opening set as it held a 17-11 lead and maintained it for a 25-22 set victory to go up 1-0. Providing two kills during the scoring stretch was senior outside hitter Milica Kubura, who tallied a total of 14 kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But the Seminoles advantage would be short lived as the Gauchos won the next two sets of the match. Ruddins and Allen set the foundation to UCSB’s pair of .240+ hitting periods, while Florida St. recorded a team-high seven errors in the third set. A service error by Kubura and an attack error by junior setter Brianne Burket in the match’s third set secured Santa Barbara’s 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Jumping out to a 6-1 lead to begin the fourth set, forcing an FSU timeout, it seemed as if the Gauchos were on their way to one of their biggest triumphs in seasons. Aside from Ruddins and Allen, contributing to the streak as well was Rivers, who had eight kills in the match.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">It wasn’t until a block by both Kubura and freshman middle Deja Williams that the Seminoles earned their first lead 12-11 of the fourth set. They would trail one last time 17-16 before stringing together an 8-2 run to win 25-18 and tie the match 2-2.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Scoring three of the Seminoles’ final five points was senior outside hitter Natasha Calkins. While Kubura set the precedent for FSU’s starting rotation, Calkins emerged as the match’s difference maker off the bench. She recorded a team and career-high of 17 kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The final set went down to the wire as neither team could take command over the other as ties reoccurred, leading to one last 13-13 stalemate.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Although Ruddins and Allen continued their consistency, their efforts wouldn’t be enough for a UCSB victory. Emerging late for FSU was Calkins for the Seminoles final two kills of the set before an error by the Gauchos’ Allen handed FSU a 15-13 set victory and 3-2 win.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span class=\"contextualExtensionHighlight ms-font-color-themePrimary ms-border-color-themePrimary ident_4428_4548\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">UCSB will search for its first victory of the season at the Utah State Tournament, which is set to take place Sept. 1-2.</span> The Gauchos will face Montana St., Pacific, and host Utah St.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78750\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78750\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/","id":4981,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4980,4979,4978],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Strong Defensive Effort Secures Gauchos First Road Victory of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_8-1-web-e1446002803422.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_8-1-web-e1446002803422.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"An early goal from senior forward Amanda Ball was enough to help the Gauchos secure a close 1-0 victory at San Jose State to begin the year 2-0.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Not even three minutes into the ball game, the UCSB women’s soccer team found themselves with the early one goal lead at Spartan Soccer Complex, that was the easy part.

With that mark, the forward is now only one of 11 UCSB women’s soccer athletes to register at least 20 career goals.</p>\n<p>With such an early score comes the presumption that this could possibly be an easy match runs through peoples’ minds. However, San Jose State hardly made that the case. The remainder of the first half was a battle with both teams equally possessing the ball without being to put one past the keeper.</p>\n<p>However, in the second half momentum shifted towards the home side who finally started to dominate possession of the ball and the match.</p>\n<p>In its previous three games, including exhibitions, UCSB often dominated the second half outscoring opponents 7-0, but San Jose State after maybe starting out a little flat, had a new fire once the second half whistle blew.</p>\n<p>Still, Santa Barbara found a way to contest every shot and still make life impossible for the home team.</p>\n<p>In the 48<sup>th</sup> minute, senior forward Dorthe Hoppius put up a deep, hard hit ball from outside of the box but right into the steady arms of senior goalkeeper Maddie Julian who had three saves in her shutout performance.</p>\n<p>Trouble continued in the 58<sup>th</sup> minute after a great through pass from freshman Gabriella Hurtado led junior forward Jennifer Orozco just inside the box, however, Julian disrupted the play with a heads up tackle and after a mad scramble, the ball was eventually cleared by freshman midfielder Colby Parker.</p>\n<p>SJSU’s best look at the equalizer came in the 60<sup>th</sup> minute off a corner kick from the right side which landed beautifully to junior forward Darriell Franklin standing right at the edge of the box on the opposite side completely unopposed. Despite not gaining full control Franklin put up the shot which trailed just bit left giving possession back to the visitors and blowing a great opportunity to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Overall, San Jose State outshot Santa Barbara 8-3 in the second half, but with only three on goal and none actually making it past Julian, the outcome finished in favor of the visiting Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another game that came down to a decisive goal from Amanda Ball is nothing new to Head Coach Paul Stumpf, however, a wonderful performance on the defensive end to hold tough is certainly a welcome sight this early in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is next Sunday, August 27<sup>th</sup> against UCLA. It will be the second game of a five-game road stand.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

season 2-1 against No. 24 Santa Clara. This game will be SJSU’s home opener, a place where it boasted an impressive 6-1-2 mark.</p>\n<p>UCSB holds a 5-2-2 overall record against San Jose State dating back to the teams’ first meeting back in 1995. The two squads last met in 2015 which ended in a 1-1 tie at Harder Stadium.

UCSB has outscored opponents 7-2 in the second half including scoring all three of their goals in the win against Idaho.</p>\n<p>Another consistent the Gauchos will hope to keep relying upon is the play of senior Amanda Ball. The forward scored two goals in the teams’ opener and now has 19 career goals in her career in just 41 games played. Ball also scored a goal in the teams 3-1 exhibition win over North Texas.</p>\n<p>Ball movement, in general, will also continue to be a factor for Santa Barbara as it held possession over Idaho 65 percent of the game and managed to have nine different Gauchos register a shot.</p>\n<p>Junior goalkeeper Brittney Rogers will also look to keep riding her hot streak after registering two saves in her first shutout win of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite coming off a loss, there is no doubt that the home Spartans are still riding high off a solid performance against a team that is nationally ranked.</p>\n<p>“They definitely are a team that comes to play and they have conceded very little to their opponents but they haven’t scored a ton so I think this one will be more of a chess match instead of a physical bout which suits us,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Trailing 1-0 for most of the match, San Jose finally scored the equalizer in the 51<sup>st</sup> minute courtesy of senior midfielder Yvette Cuellar’s first career goal. Cuellar, who is coming off an ACL tear, is regarded to be one of the team leaders for this years Spartans squad.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Ana Calero also played exceptional in spite of the two goals allowed in her first start of the year. As a freshman, Calero received the bulk playing time in the cage starting in 10 matches conceding 15 goals and tallying a 7-4-1 record. The sophomore had 10 saves against Santa Clara marking nearly 1/3 of her total from all of the last season.</p>\n<p>Other notable players to be wary of on the San Jose State side is senior forward Dorthe Hoppius who led the team in goals (8), shots (66), and points (21) last season as well as senior midfielder Yaritza Arista who assisted Cuellar in her goal against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>To be a successful squad, winning on the road is a necessity. Last season away from Santa Barbara, the Gauchos struggled only tallying a 3-4-2 record, however, all three road wins were against non-conference opponents. This year, fans will get a good early look to see how the team deals with being on the road, especially when faced with a road trip as long as this one.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on San Jose State at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, August 20 at Spartan Soccer Complex. The game can be streamed on the Spartans official athletic site.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Ball seems to be in great shape to continue her great run this season as she scored one of the goals in the exhibition against North Texas. Both she and junior midfielder Mallory Hromatko were named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team.</p>\n<p>Ball’s fellow seniors on the team, defender Kate Shoemaker, and midfielder Chace Schornstein are all poised to have a big season and, hopefully, finish their careers with a Big West championship.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors are playing very well right now, and they will be a big part of our lineup,” Stumpf said. “They’re all playing at the top of their game and I am really excited about them.”</p>\n<p>Despite all the good news out of the Santa Barbara camp right now, Idaho will not be an easy foe for UCSB to open its’ season against.</p>\n<p>The Vandals are coming off a very successful 2016-17 campaign in which they won their second consecutive Big Sky Regular Season Championship and won 10-plus games for just the fourth time in program history.</p>\n<p>Idaho was upset in the semifinal of the Big Sky Tournament losing to Eastern Washington 1-0 after allowing the game-deciding goal in the 88<sup>th</sup> minute. It was the Vandals only conference loss of the season.</p>\n<p>2017-18 will be tougher on Idaho who is replacing its top four-goal scorers from a year ago, however, mid-season transfers junior goalkeeper Makayla Presgrave and junior forward Bridget Daley hope to make the biggest impact.</p>\n<p>“They have had a lot of success over the last couple of years as a program because they really went to work on the defensive side of things with a drop and counter conceding very few goals so I expect to see something similar to that,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>These preseason games don’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of postseason hopes. UCSB will only make the postseason, in most cases, by winning the Big West championship.</p>\n<p>Because of that, an 8-0 start to the season isn’t necessary nor should it be expected with the tough preseason Santa Barbara has lined up for themselves, however, the lessons that can be learned in these games are very important heading into conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s super important to build off these games and build confidence but interestingly enough, I almost feel like a loss here or there will take the pressure off,” Stumpf said. “We want to win every game we can but that’s just not going to happen especially two years in a row but we hope to have a balanced record and be as prepared as we can for Big West play.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opens its season against Idaho at 7 p.m. on Friday, August 18 at Harder Stadium.
