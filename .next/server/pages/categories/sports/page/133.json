The Gauchos fell to No. 9 Stanford in a three-game sweep Friday night, but were able to recover with a dominant victory over the University of Pacific one night later.</p>\n<p>After splitting their matches in Northern California, the Gauchos now hold an overall record of 9-4. UCSB is currently ranked in fifth place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with a conference record of 8-4. After this weekend, Stanford advances to an MPSF record of 6-5 and Pacific moves forward with a record of 1-10.</p>\n<p>“We just needed to put that first match behind us,” junior opposite Evan Licht said. “If we came out of the week 1-1 it wasn’t a total disaster, so Pacific was a must-win for us.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos dominated the Tigers Saturday night in a quick three-game sweep (25-15, 25-17, 25-23). The Tigers’ defense was no match for the Gaucho offense, with three different players recording kills in the double digits and an overall team hitting percentage of .378. Licht and senior outside hitter Matt Hanley both led the team with 15 kills apiece.</p>\n<p>“We passed the ball a lot better against Pacific, which allowed us to run a more fluid offense,” Licht said.</p>\n<p>In addition to being a force on offense, the Gauchos also dominated the game defensively. Senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson commanded the middle with three block assists and senior libero Chad Kingi and sophomore setter Jonah Seif each had seven digs. Seif also recorded three of the team’s seven service aces against Pacific.</p>\n<p>“After the Stanford game we were able to talk to Jonah and establish a better connection between the hitters and the setter and that made a big difference,” sophomore middle blocker Ryan Hardy said. “We connected a lot better with Jonah the second night.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, one night previous, it wasn’t a similar outcome for UCSB. The Cardinal had a school-record night on defense, out-blocking the Gauchos 21.5-3.5. Stanford had three different players that recorded five blocks against UCSB and two players that recorded seven blocks against the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“First thing first, I think the Stanford game was inevitable for our season,” Hanley said. “Every really good team has a night where they are very off. I think the Stanford game was an example of that; we had been playing strongly coming up to that game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struggled to develop offensive momentum from the start, recording a hitting clip of -.030 in the first set. Although they were able to pull themselves out of the red in the second and third sets, the Gauchos were not able to get their hitting percentage above .100 for the entire game. Stanford’s sophomore middle blocker Conrad Kaminski tied his season best with eight total blocks on the night.</p>\n<p>“To Stanford’s credit, they played a very good match,” Hanley said. “They went completely against our scouting report.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue the second half of their four-game road trip this week against UC Irvine and UC San Diego.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of Feb. 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-split-matches-in-norcal-road-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-split-matches-in-norcal-road-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-split-matches-in-norcal-road-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-split-matches-in-norcal-road-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-split-matches-in-norcal-road-trip/","id":5289,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5288,5287,5286],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts UC Riverside at the Thunderdome With Six Games Left in the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in second place in the Big West with six games remaining in the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With six games left on its schedule, the UCSB men’s basketball team enters the final stretch of the regular season in hopes of finishing atop the Big West Conference standings.

In that contest, UCSB took an 11-point lead and built it to an eventual 17-point advantage in the second half. The Gauchos struggled to close out the game, however, allowing Riverside to creep back and send the game to overtime before an eventual 68-65 victory avoided an epic collapse.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had several of these this year where we’ve had leads and we’ve let things slip away. We have to develop more of a killer instinct to finish games,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We have to get hungrier in terms of our approach to each game and how we play for 40 minutes in the game. All of a sudden we’re up and you see us relax a little bit and that’s a dangerous habit to be falling into.”</p>\n<p>Closing out games has become a major area of concern for Santa Barbara and hurt the team in last Saturday’s 80-78 overtime loss to Cal State Northridge despite holding a seven-point lead with just over a minute remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s loss, UCSB failed to score in the final two minutes of overtime and turned the ball over 18 times during the entire contest. Turnovers will certainly be a key to Thursday’s contest as Riverside ranks last in the Big West with over 13 turnovers committed per game, compared to second-best UCSB with 11.4 per game.</p>\n<p>“In that Northridge game, there were certain plays we didn’t run and we didn’t do all the tasks that we needed to do to win that game and it came back to bite us,” junior center Alan Williams said. “We’ve really got to focus up on that and be more mentally tough and I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters the contest with an 8-17 overall record and 3-8 mark in conference play, which places the team last in the Big West standings. The Highlanders are currently on a three-game losing streak at the hands of three of the top teams in the conference in Long Beach, Hawaii and Irvine.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we just come out and we try to assert ourselves more consistently throughout a 40-minute game instead of the lapses that we’ve been having,” Coach Williams said. “Hopefully our familiarity is good with them, but I think they’re a better team. They’re a better team now than they were earlier this year.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders will be a pair of forwards in senior Chris Patton and sophomore Taylor Johns. Patton leads the team with 13.3 points per game, while Johns trails right behind at 13.1 per game.

The Cardinal currently hold an overall record of 8-5 and 5-5 in the MPSF. Of the games they have played this season, much of their success has been at home. They currently hold a strong record of 5-2 at Maples Pavilion in Palo Alto, CA.</p>\n<p>“Stanford is a tough place to play at. Their crowd is always loud and their student section is always rowdy,” senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson said. “It’s a fun place to play at, yet it’s really tough to get a win there.”</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos met the Cardinal earlier this season they were victorious in a 3-2 game. During that match, UCSB was led on offense by junior outside hitter Austin Kingi with 15 kills. Kingi continues to dominate offensively and is leading the Gauchos in kills overall for the season.</p>\n<p>Senior outside hitter Steven Irvin is currently leading Stanford on offense. Irvin has 176 kills on the season and is ranked third in the NCAA in aces per set.</p>\n<p>“A win against Stanford would be huge for us, especially after beating them at home already,” Thompson said. “Stanford is a very good team and a win at their place would be phenomenal.”</p>\n<p>After Friday’s match the Gauchos will travel to Stockton to face the Pacific Tigers. The Tigers are struggling all around this season. They currently hold an overall record of 2-11 and 1-9 in the MPSF. Earlier this season when the Gauchos faced Pacific, they swept the Tigers in three sets.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offense will be matched up against Pacific’s junior middle blocker Tommy Carmody. Carmody is currently leading the Tigers with 74 blocks on the season.</p>\n<p>“As a team we are really starting to realize our potential and we keep getting better every day,” Staahl said. “Again, I think it just comes back to our confidence. I mean, I think of our team as one of the strongest in the MPSF and the country.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos head into Friday night’s game with momentum on their side, entering Stanford on a three-game win streak. Stanford’s four-game streak was broken last weekend with a loss to BYU.</p>\n<p>“The only thing we have to do is maintain the same mindset heading into these away matches,” assistant coach Cullen Irons said. “We are not going to have the same crowd support we have had the past few weeks here, so we are going to have to be able to adjust to these away crowds.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s game is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start time in Palo Alto and will be aired on the Pac-12 network. Saturday’s game against Pacific is also scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54101\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/no-5-gauchos-travel-north-to-face-no-9-stanford-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54101\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/no-5-gauchos-travel-north-to-face-no-9-stanford-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/no-5-gauchos-travel-north-to-face-no-9-stanford-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/no-5-gauchos-travel-north-to-face-no-9-stanford-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/no-5-gauchos-travel-north-to-face-no-9-stanford-pacific/","id":5292,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5291,5290,5289],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Heads to Florida for Unconquered Classic Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will face four teams in five games during the weekend trip to Florida.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This weekend, the UCSB women’s softball team looks to continue its season on the road in Tallahassee, Florida by competing in the Unconquered Classic Tournament.

The four freshmen — Clark, infielder Emily Brucelas, and outfielders Stacy Cavasos and Jaqueline Hinojosa — have combined for 28 hits, 16 runs, 10 RBI and three homeruns.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Gauchos have had a very consistent performance on the offensive end. They have achieved an on base percentage of .385, which has powered their “small ball” offensive approach to earn runs more efficiently. They have been able to capitalize on their opportunities from their plate discipline by scoring 39 runs in just nine games.</p>\n<p>This weekend the team will play against a variety of teams in their third tournament of the season. Northern Iowa will be the Gauchos’ first and third matchup and they come in with a matching record of 6-3. The second team they will play will be Wichita State, whom Santa Barbara beat 7-1 in their matchup in 2013. They will then play the sure tournament favorite and host, Florida State, who comes in with a record of 10-1. The Gauchos’ last matchup will be against Florida A&amp;M which is currently riding a six-game skid.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first game will take place on Friday at 9 a.m. and the second at 11:30 a.m. The team will also have two games Saturday at 6 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. They will wrap up their tournament play with their last game on Sunday at 6 a.m. PST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-florida-for-unconquered-classic-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-florida-for-unconquered-classic-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-florida-for-unconquered-classic-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-florida-for-unconquered-classic-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-florida-for-unconquered-classic-tournament/","id":1030,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1029,1028,1027],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Turn Season Around Against Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has struggled to open the season thus far and will face the strongest team in the Big West in Irvine.

UC Irvine is one of the strongest competitors in the Big West that the Gauchos are set to meet. UCSB has been focusing heavily on mental strength and increased stamina thus far this season, and if the Gauchos want to come out of Irvine with the upset, they must dominate in these two aspects.</p>\n<p>“We have had a tough schedule this year,” junior April Scatliffe said. “It would be nice to go into our first conference match with some more wins for confidence, but we have definitely had some highlights so far. We know we have what it takes to do well this weekend. Irvine is the toughest Big West competitor that we will face, so we have to go into the match super determined and aggressive to pull of the win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their last match at home against Pacific, the Gauchos dropped a very tough decision 6-1. Many of the matches were close, but the Gauchos fell short nearly every time, with four of the six singles matches decided by a third set tiebreak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been plagued with injuries so far this season, and as a result, have been shifting their starting lineup quite frequently. The Gauchos have had three different starters at the first singles position thus far, and have really been trying to find their strongest lineup. However, in the case of this weekend’s match against UC Irvine, UCSB looks to be the healthiest it has been all season long with players returning to the court from injuries.</p>\n<p>Irvine has had a decent season for being ranked No. 42 by the NCAA. They have defeated strong opponents in San Diego State 4-0, and Cal State Fullerton 4-3, but have been blown out by No. 30 ranked TCU 4-0 and were outmatched by No. 44 Pepperdine 6-1. In their last match against No. 9 USC, the Anteaters were swept 7-0.</p>\n<p>Starting at number one singles for UC Irvine is Marivick Mamiit who fell to USC’s Brynn Boren 3-6, 2-6. The Anteaters have indeed had a tough schedule, but have dropped matches to teams who they were projected to defeat or who were of lesser rank. If the Gauchos arrive ready to win and get themselves in an early match lead against UC Irvine, then UCSB has a high chance of retrieving the win and the upset on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Another factor contributing to the Gauchos is the change of scoring rules against conference opponents. The NCAA had been working out a trial run of new scoring to make non-conference games shorter. In all of UCSB’s matches up to this point, there has been no complete third set, but rather a tiebreak to determine a winner if the first two sets have been split. This has been received with great disdain by the UCSB players, because instead of a match being determined by skill, it becomes more of a toss-up of who can reach 10 points in the tiebreak first.</p>\n<p>“Irvine will definitely be tough,” senior Kiersten Meehan said. “They are one of the toughest teams in the conference, but it will be great to go back to old scoring. I think we are a very fit team, so having the old scoring back will definitely work in our favor.”</p>\n<p>The match is set to begin this Saturday at 11 a.m. at the UC Irvine tennis courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54105\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54105\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/","id":219,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[218,217,216],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face No. 2 USC, Fresno State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels to face No. 2 USC befoer hosting Fresno State in a pair of weekend matches.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It was a disappointing trip to Hawaii for the UCSB men’s tennis team as the Gauchos lost to Hawaii Pacific on Saturday 6-1 and then saw the rain cancel their first conference match of the season against Hawaii University.

The Trojans are 7-1 this season and will be looking to add to their record to ensure their place in the NCAA Tournament at the end of the season. USC is coming off losing in the championship match of the ITA National Team Indoor Championships to Ohio State, now the No. 1 ranked team in the nation. USC defeated No. 15 Tennessee, No. 7 Baylor and reigning NCAA runners-up No. 4 UCLA in order to make it to the championship match where the team lost 4-1. This result was similar to that of USC’s loss to Ohio State last spring in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played well against USC in the past,” Davis said. “They are a great team and it’s my job to get our guys excited for the opportunity to take on this top ranked side and to try to get the upset.”</p>\n<p>The Trojans will be led by senior No. 7 Ray Sarmiento and junior No. 16 Yannick Hanfmann. Both players earned ITA All-American honors last year for singles and look to do the same this year. As a doubles pair, they are ranked No. 35 in the nation and will be a big test for Sultan/Gryaznov as the Gauchos top pair.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos will come home to take on Fresno State. The Bulldogs are 2-6 overall and have lost their last four matches, most recently to No. 76 Santa Clara this past Sunday, 4-0. After winning all three doubles matches, Santa Clara won the first three singles matches and the dual match was deemed over. The Bulldogs also had a match against Pacific on Wednesday night and will take on New Mexico at home on Friday before playing the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We don’t know much about Fresno State,” Davis said. “They have a new coach, almost a completely new lineup, but I think we will have a great match against them.”</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs’ top player is junior Sai Kartik Nakireddi. He will be followed by freshmen John Darmstaedter and Eric Komati and sophomore Nikolas Papic. The Bulldogs have struggled in doubles, as the Gauchos have, losing the doubles point in their last four losses as well. The Gauchos will look to capitalize on this and gain momentum in order to win the rest for the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on USC at 1 p.m. on Friday in Los Angeles and will play Fresno State at home on Sunday at 1 p.m. at the tennis courts behind the Recreational Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/","id":216,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[215,214,213],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces UCR With Postseason on the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-3_Vandendelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-3_Vandendelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces Riverside in a game that could determine which team receives the final spot in the Big West Tournament.

There are always seniors on another team that sometimes aren’t looking at the record,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They’re trying to extend their playing careers and go out on a good note. I know we’re probably going to get their best game, no doubt about it, especially since they were our first conference win.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the matchup in eighth place at 2-8 in conference and 7-16 overall. The Highlanders are currently in the cellar of the Big West standings at 1-10 in league and 5-19 overall. With only the top eight teams going to playoffs, this game could have serious postseason implications.</p>\n<p>All season, consistency has been the biggest problem for UCSB. Even this past weekend, the Gauchos beat Long Beach in a nearly flawless game, scoring a season-high 80 points while forcing the 49ers into 22 turnovers before falling in blowout fashion to Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on putting two games together. We know that we can be a spectacular team one night and not so good another night,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’re trying to limit those highs and lows and continue to be positive and use the momentum to make good things happen. For us, it’s going to be about putting two games together, especially on the road.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the Long Beach game, Santa Barbara fell behind early against the Matadors and could never recover. The Gauchos were also dominated on the boards as Northridge outrebounded UCSB 55-28.</p>\n<p>As a result, the focus this week for UCSB was rebounding. In fact, in the Gauchos’ first conference victory this year when they beat Riverside 74-61 in the Thunderdome, Santa Barbara won the rebounding battle by a wide margin, 55-30, including 21-6 on the offensive boards. This led to 23 second-chance points and the Gauchos outscoring the Highlanders 34-6 in the paint.</p>\n<p>This season, UCSB averages 40.0 rebounds in victories compared to 30.6 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We keep getting reminded that we had 55 rebounds (last time against UCR), which was our highest rebounding game this year,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “That’s obviously what let us win the game, so if we focus on that, we should be good.”</p>\n<p>After losing 16 straight games, Riverside finally earned its first conference win Saturday 87-75 over UC Irvine. The Highlanders won the game on the offensive end, shooting 53.8 percent from the field and a phenomenal 61.1 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Leading Riverside, per usual, was sophomore guard Brittany Crain. She scored 22 against Irvine and was one of four players in double-figures for the Highlanders. On the season, Crain leads the Big West in scoring at 18.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you’re ever going to stop a great player like her, but we have to make her work,” Mitchell said. “With a player like that, you have to ID her at all times and make her work to score her points.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end for UCSB, the Gauchos will continue to look to their seniors. Nesbit led the team with 20 points in the last matchup while Zornig also added 16 points.</p>\n<p>Recently, Zornig has caught fire, recording her first career double-double in Northridge with 21 points and 11 rebounds, including 4-6 shooting from behind the arc. The leader in three-point percentage during conference play at 57.4 percent has hit at least two threes in eight straight games and currently stands 17 points shy of 1,000 points.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] continues to have an attack mentality and she’s shooting the ball with confidence,” Mitchell said. “She’s taking good shots, she’s being assertive on the offensive end and she’s also rebounding. She’ll get two or three rebound putbacks every game, so she’s scoring in a variety of ways.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at SRC Arena.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Mercurio led the team in hits last season and is currently hitting .400, while Carroll has the team’s only homerun so far.</p>\n<p>Mercurio and Carroll are but a few of the returning players from last season as 14 freshmen make up the Spartans’ 20 man roster.

UCSB has a winning record against SJSU since 2010, going 9-6 overall and 4-2 when playing at the Spartans’ home field. In its last two seasons UCSB has swept the Spartans.</p>\n<p>In its previous game, the Gauchos relied on the arms of their bullpen after starting pitcher, sophomore Dylan Hecht, struggled with his command, giving up four walks and having two wild pitches in four innings played.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Hector Lujan came in relief and pitched three impressive innings, allowing just one runner to get on base and striking out five batters in three innings on the mound. Junior Greg Mahle and sophomore Dillion Tate came in the last two innings in relief.</p>\n<p>UCSB was relatively quiet on offense except for a momentum changing homerun by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa in the third inning. The three-run blast came as Cal State Bakersfield allowed two runners on base after previously not scoring on a bases loaded situation in the top half of the inning.</p>\n<p>The homerun was all UCSB needed to secure the win, but added additional runs in the sixth and eighth inning to seal the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will rely on a combination of a deep pitching rotation and small ball to counter San Jose’s home field advantage.</p>\n<p>Game time for the first game between the teams is for Friday at 6 p.m., with games on Saturday and Sunday beginning at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>That situation completely changed tonight when UCSB fell to Riverside on the road 67-57, blowing a 10 point second half lead.</p>\n<p>“Definitely, [after tonight, playoffs] cross your mind when you drop one like this, but we’re continuing to look forward,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’ll think about this one until midnight and then look to what we have coming next.”</p>\n<p>With the loss, the Gauchos fall to 7-17 overall and 2-9 in conference. They do remain a half game up on the Highlanders, which improved to 6-19 overall and 1-10 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara takes the loss, the team actually owned the lead the majority of the game. After a 9-0 run late in the first half, UCSB extended its lead to 10 points at 37-27 with 13:23 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>From there, it was all Riverside. A three by the Highlander’s leading scorer and sophomore guard Brittany Crain capped off an 11-0 run for UCR, giving the team its first lead since midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t stop the bleeding as Riverside extended the run to 28-7, putting Santa Barbara in an 11-point hole with little time left on the clock.</p>\n<p>“They got after us more on the defensive end. They started trying to deny Nic and [senior guard Melissa Zornig], so it made it tough for us to run patterns. It’s human nature when that happens to go into panic mode and we had the wrong people taking shots late in the shot clock,” Mitchell said. “We’re too late in the year. We have to understand who the offense needs to go to and through and then be able to get stops on the other end.”</p>\n<p>Despite a solid first half, holding the Highlanders to 19 points, UCSB gave up 48 second half points as it was outscored 48-33.</p>\n<p>On the game, UCSB didn’t shoot well, shooting 34.4 percent from the field. Riverside’s offense, on the other hand, resembled its attack from last Saturday when the team shot 53.8 percent from the field, defeating UC Irvine for its first conference victory. Tonight, the Highlanders shot an incredible 56 percent from the field in the second half.</p>\n<p>“They were knocking down shots,” Nesbit said. “Everything that they were putting up it seemed like was going in and with that comes lots of energy and momentum. Once they started to get hot, everyone started to bring tons of energy.”</p>\n<p>Crain led UCR offensively, recording a double-double with 28 points and 11 rebounds. Freshman guard Simone DeCoud also stepped up with 18 points. During Riverside’s 28-7 run in the second half, the two combined for 22 of the 28 points.</p>\n<p>“You have Brittany Crain, who’s the leading scorer in the Big West, and we’re not matched up with her in transition defense or we had our five player guarding her,” Mitchell said. “That tells me there’s a lack of focus or in transition we didn’t communicate because she got two or three open threes with our five player guarding her.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the seniors led the way once again. Both Nesbit and senior guard Melissa Zornig finished with 16 points while senior guard Destini Mason added 11 points.</p>\n<p>“The kids read the internet. They understand our record,” Mitchell said. “With this team, it’s probably a little more pressure than they handle. We need to focus on what we need to do and hope it will lead to a couple wins in the final five games of the season.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to regroup quickly for Saturday’s game at Cal State Fullerton. Tipoff is set for 6 p.m. at Titan Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara got off to a disappointing start after opening its season 2-5 at home in the UCSB Winter Invite, but has maintained a high national ranking due to the extremely tough opponents it has faced. With a young squad composed of many freshmen and sophomores, the Gauchos have had few chances to play together thus far, but they continue to grow with every game.</p>\n<p>“The first tournament helped us to kind of see where we’re at and we figured out a lot of things we need to work on,” sophomore utility Samantha Murphy said. “In the San Diego tournament it was really good to work on a lot of new things offensively and defensively. I think we improved a lot and we’re looking to improve more this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The next opponent for the Gauchos is Cal, a team that it faced just three weekends ago at home and was defeated, 14-4. In that game, UCSB fell behind early and never had much of a chance to catch up, already trailing 8-1 by halftime.</p>\n<p>“Cal is a really strong team. All of their players are really strong, and they capitalize on any of our little mistakes,” Murphy said. “When we play them again it’ll be a much different game. We watched film and we went over our mistakes and we’re really going to capitalize on the improvements we made on defense and offense in the last tournament. Even though they’re a top-ranked team, we’re looking to surprise them.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Bears offensively this season has been driver Dora Antal. The impressive freshman has marked an outstanding 46 goals in 12 games. To put this number in perspective, her team has given up a total of 69 goals this season, and the player with the second most goals on the team, freshman driver Anna Illes, has just 19.</p>\n<p>“Every single one of them can shoot the lights out of the ball,” Hudson said. “At San Diego we really all clicked and started to mesh and gel together so I think it’ll definitely be a different game this time, just because of the fact that we’re learning how to communicate and play defense together.”</p>\n<p>One of the main problems for the Gauchos has been their offense. In their seven losses, they scored an average of six goals per game, compared to nine goals per game in their four wins.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we need to be more confident shooting,” Murphy said. “I think just the fact that we’re a little bit younger than we were last year makes us a little more hesitant to shoot, and we don’t have as many upperclassmen as we did last year, so we just need more confidence in our shooting.”</p>\n<p>Depending on whether they win or lose their first game, the Gauchos will likely play No. 17 UC Davis this weekend as well. The Aggies, who just barely edged UCSB by a score of 6-5 in San Diego, possess an 8-7 record and have already upset two teams higher than them in the rankings.</p>\n<p>“[It] is going to be a big game for us,” Murphy said. “We’re looking forward to playing them again and getting a win out of it because we play them in the Big West, too. It’s a team we know we can beat, we just need to work on our shooting.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play California at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday in the Anteater Aquatics Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/","id":5090,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5089,5088,5087],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Its Season With a Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-v-CSUB-peter-vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-v-CSUB-peter-vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=797%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos beat Cal State Bakersfield 5-1","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its first game of the season, the UCSB baseball team defeated Cal State Bakersfield 5-1 on the strength of its bullpen after a rocky performance from its starting pitcher.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht, the team’s best pitcher coming into the season, put UCSB in an early hole until the Gauchos responded with a three-run homerun that proved to be the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t look like himself.

While at Edison, Boswell became the all-time leader in career points, averaging over 23 points per game as a senior behind a deadly perimeter shot. That outside shot garnered the attention of UCSB, a dream come true for Kyle, who was interested in more than just basketball.</p>\n<p>With a scholarship in hand, Boswell knew he wanted to become a Gaucho and major in mechanical engineering, but faced road blocks in achieving that goal from the time he stepped on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our engineering program is definitely at the top of the line. I didn’t get into the program because it was so competitive,” Boswell said. “I had to petition and take some courses and compete against some of the people for them to even consider me to get into the major. After about a year and a half, they told me my performance in the classroom was good enough to let me in. That in itself was a blessing.”</p>\n<p>His 3.8 GPA is evidence enough that he warranted a spot in an engineering program that often ranks in the top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>Moving onto campus, Boswell had the task of balancing more than your average Gaucho had to, adjusting to college life and taking engineering courses in addition to his duties as a basketball player. During his freshman year, Boswell played a reserve role for a team that advanced to the NCAA Tournament, starting six of the 21 contests he played in.</p>\n<p>During his sophomore season, Boswell truly became an outside weapon for Santa Barbara, leading the team in three-point field goal percentage while ranking in the top four in minutes played. This is when Boswell emerged as a sixth man for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I absolutely love being the sixth man. I like to kind of sit back for a couple minutes in the game, see the landscape and how the flow’s going, how our team’s playing and what I need to do coming off the bench,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Since then, Boswell has volunteered to come off the bench, a role in which he has certainly found success. Last season, Boswell averaged 13 points per game on his way to the Sixth Man of the Year award and all-conference honorable mention. This year, he ranks second on the Gauchos in scoring with 11 points per game and currently ranks third in school history in three-pointers made.</p>\n<p>Aside from his success on the court, Boswell has received tremendous recognition for his ability to balance academics as well. This past fall Boswell was named one of 30 semi-finalists for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, was named the Big West Scholar Athlete of the Year for men’s basketball and is also a two-time recipient of the Golden Eagle award for academic excellence.</p>\n<p>“In terms of being successful here as a student athlete, anyone can do it. I’m not like a freak of nature, who, like no other kid in the school, can do what I do,” Boswell said. “You’ve honestly got to love what you do and just put in the work. It’s the lifestyle; you’ve got to embrace the challenge and give it all you got.”</p>\n<p>While not unheard of, being a student-athlete in the engineering department is certainly rare, and something Boswell and his professors must talk over due to the demands of travel for competition.</p>\n<p>“Not many athletes come out of this department so it’s kind of new for [professors]. Kind of every quarter, I need to talk to teachers right away and let them know my situation,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>This upcoming summer, Boswell will intern with Chevron in Los Angeles in a major step towards achieving his eventual goal of working in an oil field.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it will be great for me because I love learning about the thermodynamics side of stuff and fluid mechanics, and you put that together and you get working in an oil field,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Boswell will exhaust his eligibility for basketball after this season, but will return to UCSB next year to complete his degree without the athlete title. Needless to say, academics should be a piece of cake for Boswell next year without the extra demand of collegiate athletics.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that I could have only dreamed about. You don’t get this many opportunities in life where you’re exposed to such a high caliber education and at the same time you’re playing at the highest collegiate level of basketball,” Boswell said. “UCSB is a paradise and I couldn’t ask for anything more out of the school.”</p>\n<p>Boswell and the rest of the UCSB men’s basketball team host UC Riverside tomorrow at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of Feb. 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/","id":538,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[537,536,535],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Northridge for First Time Since 1984","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos fall to the Matadors 78-54.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>College basketball is a 40 minute game.

Northridge improves to 13-13 overall and 9-3 in conference.</p>\n<p>From the tip, Mitchell went with a small lineup, which was successful Thursday against Long Beach State. Instead, UCSB paid the price on the boards, losing the rebounding battle 55-28. CSUN also destroyed Santa Barbara in second chance points at 26-9.</p>\n<p>“They kicked our butts is what they did,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “(Junior center) Camille Mahlknecht on her own had (almost) as many rebounds as we had as a team. Our lack of block outs led to 26 second chance points and that’s the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Leading Northridge was Mahlknecht. While she averages just 7.7 points and 7.7 rebounds on the year, she was the thorn in the Gauchos’ side, recording a season-high 21 points, a program record and career-high 22 rebounds and five blocks on a career-high 10 made field goals.</p>\n<p>“We took all switches one through five, but I don’t think that was the issue. When we look at it, I think a lot of it will be high-low hits against our biggest post players,” Mitchell said. “That’s a mentality. She’s a good player, but she plays with a lot of heart and she understands her role. A lot of plays aren’t being run through her with the three great guards they have, so she’s finding a way to dictate the outcome of the game by getting rebounds and putbacks.”</p>\n<p>The Matadors started the game right where they left off when they beat Cal Poly 83-57 Thursday. Against the Mustangs, Northridge went 11-22 from three point range. With Santa Barbara down 4-7 in the first half, Northridge went on a 10-0 run, starting the game 3-5 from downtown and shooting 66.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>After Northridge’s lead reached its largest of the half at 19 points, Santa Barbara came alive. Fueled by the three Gaucho seniors, the team went on a 12-2 run to cut the lead to nine. Several times in the second half, UCSB came within nine, but could never get the needed play to break the barrier.</p>\n<p>With just less than eight minutes remaining at the lead at that same nine point lead, the Matadors closed the door they had been leaving open for UCSB, going on a 19-6 run to finish the game.</p>\n<p>“I remember we missed a couple easy shots,” Mitchell said. “That’s going to happen in the game of basketball, but at the end of the day, you need to sprint back and say, ‘okay, well now let’s get a stop.’ That’s the only way if things aren’t flowing smoothly on the offensive end is that you have to buckle down and get stops. We didn’t.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Zornig led the team offensively with her first double-double of her career, tallying 21 points and a career high 11 rebounds. She shot 8-18 from the field, including 4-6 from behind the arc. Nesbit also added 14 points for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Mel is so consistent. I don’t know if she knows she’s near 1,000 points or not, but at the end of the day, she’s getting after it,” Mitchell said. “She’s doing it on both ends of the floor, but she’s carrying too much of the burden. We have to have other players willing to join her.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their three-game road trip next week when they travel to UC Riverside Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear int he print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54048\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54048\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/","id":536,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[535,534,533],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tries to Rebound, Returns to Play Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-4-1.26.2014-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-4-1.26.2014-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces former conference foe Pacific at home this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Looking for a rebound from last week’s losses to Washington State and the University of Washington, the UCSB women’s tennis team prepares to host Pacific University this Sunday in its second home game of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB (1-5) looks to gain a win against Pacific (2-2) in hopes of avoiding what would be a fourth consecutive loss. The Gauchos currently find themselves in an early season slump. Although conference play has yet to commence, a win Sunday would really boost the Gauchos’ morale and keep them from falling deeper in the losing column.</p>\n<p>In their last match, the Gauchos endured a tough loss and were shut out by No. 41 ranked Washington University 7-0. Freshman Kaiulani Boyer had her inaugural start at first singles for the Gauchos last Sunday, but was defeated by Washington’s Grace Ysidora 6-2, 7-6. The only other match where the Gauchos put up a considerable fight was the second singles duel. Junior April Scatliffe, who has been an extensive aid to the Gauchos thus far, faced Washington’s Elianne Douglas-Miron. The entirety of the match was close, but in the end Douglas-Miron outlasted Scatliffe 7-6, 3-6, 10-6.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Washington is among the strongest teams in the Pac-12 and one of the tougher opponents UCSB will face all season. The Gauchos also had the dilemma of traveling overnight from their earlier match against Washington State on Saturday, which is nearly 300 miles from Seattle where University of Washington is located. This Sunday however, the Gauchos will be at home against Pacific, a team similar to the Gauchos in terms of skill level.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be great to play at home,” senior Kiersten Meehan said. “I know it was a tough transition for everyone last weekend to go from here to snowy weather and having to play indoors. Pacific is always a competitive match, so I am sure the home court advantage will be a deciding factor.”</p>\n<p>Pacific travels to UCSB winning two of its last three matches. The Tigers latest match was a shootout victory over New Mexico State 4-3. Starting at number one singles for Pacific is Iveta Masarova who handily defeated NMSU’s Ros-Polly Nguyen 6-3, 6-2. UCSB will definitely have its hands full on Sunday, and pulling off a win will involve the intensified stamina and mental capabilities that the Gauchos have been pushing for all season.</p>\n<p>“We feel very pumped because we lost a close one to Pacific last year with a score of 4-3, so we are definitely ready to get some revenge this weekend,” Scatliffe said. “I think the energy we are going to bring and the comfort with playing at home will be key factors for us. Everyone is going to need to step it up and take care of business on their court.”</p>\n<p>The match is set to begin this Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Recreational Center tennis courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 13, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54012\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54012\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/","id":217,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[216,215,214],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Open Conference Play in Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB faces two opponents on its road trip to Hawaii this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a weekend full of matches and two practices this week, the UCSB men’s tennis team heads to beautiful Hawaii for some fun in the sun and some serious competition on the courts. The Gauchos leave on Thursday and take on Hawaii Pacific on Saturday, followed by their first conference match against Hawaii on Sunday.</p>\n<p>When looking back on a victory over LMU on Saturday and loss to Arizona on Sunday, senior Sasha Gryaznov said, “Good win on Saturday, [we] clutched it out. Overall the team is getting better, I think. We are competing. I love seeing the guys compete hard, and then good things happen.”</p>\n<p>The team will look to junior and No. 108 ranked Tobias Galskov to carry the team again this weekend. Playing in the number two slot in the lineup, Galskov won both of his matches last weekend, with his win against LMU sealing the match victory for the Gauchos. He is 3-2 in singles this season and hopes to extend his two-match win streak in Hawaii. Galskov was named Big West Men’s Athlete of the Week for last week’s performance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Along with Galskov, the Gauchos will need junior Ziad Sultan to play his part. Playing in the number one slot this season, Sultan is in 2-3 and will be needed to win tough matches against top players on opposing teams as league play begins.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope to improve their doubles play after losing every doubles match against LMU and Arizona.</p>\n<p>“We were pitiful in the doubles. That’s ultimately what killed us,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “We were terrible in the doubles both days, and we’ll need to win that point against University of Hawaii. We will definitely be focusing on doubles and serving.”</p>\n<p>First up is Hawaii Pacific. The Sea Warriors are 1-0 this season with a 7-0 annihilation of Sacramento State on Jan. 16. Since then, the team has played in the Royal Lahaina Challenger Tournament and received plenty of practice for upcoming matches. Their top players will be sophomore Thibaud Berland, sophomore Jaume Martinez-Vich and junior Mattis Wetzel. Other players expected to play singles will be junior Yann Renault, senior Petr Michnev and freshman Aaron Machida.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will be the Gaucho’s first conference battle. The team is 1-3 so far this season with a win over Sacramento State and losses to Stanford, UC Berkeley and Pacific. Playing in the top spot will be senior Jonathan Brooklyn who is 2-1 this season. Also battling the Gauchos will be junior Nils Schuhmann, who won his last match against Pacific, senior Danilo Casanova, senior David Schuster and juniors Chas Okamoto and Carter Lam. This match marks the beginning of league play for both teams, and they will both want to come out with a victory to begin their conference seasons.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play Hawaii Pacific on Saturday at noon, and the University of Hawaii on Sunday at 4 p.m., both times PST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 13, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54005\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-open-conerene-play-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54005\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-open-conerene-play-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-open-conerene-play-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-open-conerene-play-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-open-conerene-play-in-hawaii/","id":214,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[213,212,211],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":133,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
