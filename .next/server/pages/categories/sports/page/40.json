\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite the team’s sub-par record at this point, the Gauchos are looking for progress and another come-from-behind conference season. Four games in, it looks like Santa Barbara is on the right track.</p>\n<p>Heading into conference play last season featured Santa Barbara sitting at 5-8; however, the Gauchos came alive in Big West play, going 9-7 and improving to 16-16 overall to close out the season at .500.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to compete against Long Beach State in the Big West Championship, falling just short of the 49ers.</p>\n<p>While there have certainly been rough patches through Santa Barbara’s 2017-2018 campaign thus far, the Gauchos have demonstrated continual improvement. Improvement that, if continued, will perhaps carry Santa Barbara to another successful run in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m process-oriented, I’m not result oriented. If you focus on just a result, you’re not going to address the process element of the result. So for us, continuing to grow stretches where we play well and execute and we have the effort and the energy and the attention to detail it takes to be successful,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>“Then shrink the stretches of the opposite of that where we’ve not been disciplined, we’ve not been dialed in and not brought energy.”</p>\n<p>While turnovers remain a frustrating stat for UCSB, the Gauchos are finding ways to win. In their victory over New Mexico State, the Gauchos turned the ball over 22 times in spite of winning by 30 points. In the close win against rival Cal Poly, UCSB committed 33 turnovers. Santa Barbara’s averaging 17.8 turnovers per game this season, but 19.3 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite turnover woes, the Gauchos have been finding their rhythm offensively as they work the ball inside to redshirt senior Drew Edelman more effectively.</p>\n<p>Edelman is having an even better year than last season and that’s with her early battles with various injuries.</p>\n<p>The 6’4 forward is posting a statline of 14.3 points per game, which is almost four more points than she averaged last season, to go along with 9.4 boards.</p>\n<p>When simply looking at Santa Barbara’s results this season, it may be easy to dismiss the Gauchos in favor of Big West teams with better records.</p>\n<p>But, it is the constant adjustment as well as overall improvement that carries a team through a season, which Henrickson understands.</p>\n<p>“Good players and good teams find success and get better because they eliminate the things that don’t work and bad teams stay bad because they continue to do the things that don’t work,” said Henrickson. “[The Big West] is really good, young, fun and talented and exciting.”</p>\n<p>With momentum and anticipation of Big West competition, the Gauchos will certainly be put to the test as they seek to improve the process rather than simply the result.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Andrew Hernandez<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-2018 season has not been kind to the 49ers of the Long Beach State women’s basketball team so far. The team’s overall record of 2-16 is a far cry from the 9-6 record the team had at the end of its non-conference schedule last season.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have had difficulty establishing a winning rhythm, and are winless at 0-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The team had eight players, including four seniors, leave from last year’s squad but were able to fill the spots by bringing seven freshmen to the team. Among those freshmen were Ma’Qhi Berry, Shanaijah Davison and Emma Merriweather, who have done their best to make their impact on the team felt. Each player has scored 100+ points so far this season, but the team has still found themselves coming up short.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ last win came on Dec. 7 in an exciting game that came down to the final minutes when senior Cecily Wilson put LBSU ahead by six with a layup. The 49ers were able to hold off GCU until time expired.</p>\n<p>Wilson is the only senior present within the team’s top four scorers and currently leads the 49ers in rebounds, averaging 6.6 a game. The veteran presence on the team has certainly taken a dive due to last year’s departures, but Wilson has shown that the team has the potential to do well given their significant amount of youth and guidance from the more experienced members of the team.</p>\n<p>“In order for us to be successful in conference play, we have to be more consistent on both ends off the floor. We have to stay disciplined and maintain our effort for 40 min,” Head Coach Jeff Cammon said. “To be specific, limit second chance opportunities by boxing out/rebounding on defensive end. Lastly, we have to take care of the ball and value possessions on [the] offensive end. This conference is tough, and we have to have a competitive mentality every night.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host UCSB Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Following last season’s below average 7-9 record in Big West conference play, the Cal Poly women’s basketball team entered this year with something to prove.</p>\n<p>Now 8-7 overall, the Mustangs will try to find areas in which they can improve their game.</p>\n<p>They currently hold a conference record of 2-1 as the Big West competition unfurls.</p>\n<p>After ending third to last in the previous Big West regular season, Cal Poly’s Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh will want to return to major tournament play during her 21st season in the manager role and after four appearances in either the NCAA Tournament or WNIT since 2011.</p>\n<p>To help achieve this she’ll look to her most veteran players for help on reaching this team goal.</p>\n<p>Trying to improve upon last season’s seeding of No. 7 overall, Cal Poly has already started off on the right foot with their 2-1 record that places them in a tie for third overall in the Big West conference standings.</p>\n<p>Three Cal Poly players to keep an eye on as the regular season rolls on would be junior center Devin Stanback, senior forward Emily Anderson and senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who are all statistical leaders in their own individual Big West categories.</p>\n<p>After coming off their most recent 84-71 win at home against the CSUN women’s basketball program, hopes are high for what this Cal Poly women’s basketball squad can truly accomplish.</p>\n<p>Made up of mostly returning upperclasswomen, spearheaded by Mimnaugh’s stellar coaching talents and a familiar game scheme aimed at success; this side expects at the very least a deep playoff run as it continues to progress into the 2017-18 campaign.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will host UC Davis this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Sean White<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Fullerton’s 1-15 conference record last season was the third time in program history that it finished with just one win in conference play.</p>\n<p>CSUF’s 16-16 record in 2006-07 was its last time ending a season with an overall record of .500 or above, and its 8-7 conference finish was its last conference winning record.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, such results led to the hiring of Head Coach Jeff Harada. In his first year, he has already helped the Titans eclipse their conference win total of last season.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 7-10, 2-2 in the Big West, the Titans are tied for fourth place in the conference. With no Big West Tournament appearances in the last two years, the Titans’ time to rise may be near.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest thing I’ve learned this year has been patience. As a coach we are all very competitive by nature and want to win every game we play right away,” Harada said. “Understanding the history and state of our program, my goal is obviously to change that, but I have to remind myself that it’s not going to happen overnight. It truly is a process. Turning those small victories into bigger ones will hopefully take us where we want to be in the future.”</p>\n<p>Key factors within this process are junior guards Hannah Thompson and Jade Vega, who both rank in the top 10 of the Big West in scoring with averages of 12 PPG.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell if Fullerton can manage to put together a run that will secure a spot within the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Until then, we wait for March.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Brandon Victor<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Despite losing its first five games of the season, the Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team looks like it could possibly contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p>CSUN (8-9, 1-2) recovered from its tough start by ripping off four straight wins, however, things have slightly declined considering the Matadors’ current two-game losing streak after defeating Cal State Fullerton in their first conference game of the season, 70-68.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s recent slump, the presence of junior center Channon Fluker could possibly catapult the Matadors up the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Fluker, who was named the Big West Player of the Year last season, became the second player in Big West history to lead the conference in scoring, rebounding and blocks.</p>\n<p>In 17 games played this season, she has recorded eight double-doubles while averaging a conference leading 20.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Fluker even recorded a triple-double during the team’s Dec. 30 game against Seattle, scoring 28 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, all while setting a conference record with 13 blocks en route to a 67-62 victory.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest strengths this season are our post play, depth and rebounding,” Head Coach Jason Flower said.</p>\n<p>The team will need to improve its late-game execution if it hopes to compete for the conference title this season. Other than a 48-point drubbing by Oregon to start the season, all of CSUN’s losses have been by single digits this season.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s next match is against Cal State Fullerton at  7p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18 at the Matadome.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Andrew Bishop<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Second-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue and her players entered the 2017-18 season with one goal in mind: to leave their 2016-17 season behind. Last year, the Anteaters went a paltry 5-26, with only three wins against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>“Last year I took over a team that was mainly senior-based,” Inoue said. “They did a good job, we just couldn’t finish games.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems Inoue faced going into this season was rebuilding a team that had recently lost a number of key seniors. “I had to replace a lot just because I was losing a lot,” she said. “A lot of the players from last year aren’t here this season, so it’s been a fresh start.”</p>\n<p>Irvine’s younger players have shared the bulk of the scoring throughout the majority of the season, with the help of sophomore guards Lauren Saiki (8.7 points per game) and Yazzy Sa’Dullah (7.7 points per game), and freshman forward Jordan Sanders (8.1 points per game).</p>\n<p>Irvine has also been supported in recent games by redshirt junior transfer guard Morgan Green, who made her Anteater debut on Jan. 4 against UC Davis. Green was sidelined throughout Irvine’s 2016-17 season, and the non-conference portion of its 2017-18 season due to NCAA transfer regulations.</p>\n<p>Despite suffering a loss to current conf. leader UC Davis in her first game as an Anteater, Green has lit up the scoreboard in her three appearances, averaging 22.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off of a 77-74 win against UCSB which puts them at 2-1 in conference play. They will hope to add to their win total and continue their comeback season as they face Cal Poly this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Jorge Mercado<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-18 season has been an odd one for the Hawaii women’s basketball team. After going 7-6 in non-conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were poised to make some noise come Big West play. Unfortunately for them, that has yet to be the case.</p>\n<p>Hawaii began conference play with three straight losses, with two on the road, but rebounded in their most recent effort in a home win against last place Long Beach State to have a 1-3 mark at this point in the conference season. They are currently in eighth place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Hawaii has some good talent. They currently possess the second-best shooting percentage in the conference at 40.8 and average 64.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Their leading scorer has been senior guard Sarah Toeaina, who was named to the Preseason All-Conference team by both the media and the coaches. She currently averages 14.1 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the team averaging double figures is sophomore guard Julissa Tago, who is scoring 10.8 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The preseason poll had both coaches and the media expecting the Rainbow Wahine to finish in fourth place; however, with the struggles the team has going for them so far, there is no doubt there needs to be some work done before that prediction could become a reality.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing Hawaii has going for them, it is that they are currently 6-4 at home; however, now that Big West play is in full swing, they will need to shore up that defense on the road as well if they want to have some success.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s next match is against UCR on Thursday, Jan. 18, at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Spencer Ault<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team entered the Big West Tournament with high hopes last season. UCSB brought those hopes crashing to the ground in the semifinals, defeating the Aggies 73-59 before falling to Long Beach State 56-55 in the finals.</p>\n<p>Disappointed as it was, UC Davis managed to bounce back in the WNIT. The Aggies advanced to the Sweet 16 after beating Utah and Colorado State, before falling to Washington State.</p>\n<p>Building off that postseason success, the Aggies are 13-3, and kicked off their season with ten straight wins.</p>\n<p>One of those wins came over Washington State in an impressive 91-76 victory that displayed how the Aggies have in fact improved from last year’s strong season. UCD’s success has continued in Big West play as well, as the team has gone 3-0 with victories over Irvine, Riverside and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch has borne the bulk of the scoring load for UCD with 19.8 points per game. Bertsch was named to the first-team All-Big West last season, and is on pace to earn a repeat of the honor on this go around.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Pele Gianotti joined Bertsch on that team last season. Gianotti has been effective this season as well with around ten points per game and a team-high 5.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Rachel Nagel is next in line for scoring with 11.6 points per game, and has knocked down 42.6 percent of her three point attempts. That’s not the highest mark on the team, an honor that goes to senior guard Dani Nafekh, but it’s still a marksman-like percentage.</p>\n<p>UCD will have its first chance to redeem its semifinal upset loss when it takes on the Gauchos on Thursday, Jan. 18 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Kendra Jackson<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Riverside Highlanders are 5-13 overall and are currently 2-2 in Big West conference play. With a 3-4 record at home, the team has only managed to reign victorious away from the confines of the UCR Student Recreation Center once this season.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, when considering the team’s progress last season, the Highlanders ended as the fourth seed in the Big West tournament. With a 16-15 record overall and 9-7 in conference play, the initial first round matchup for UCR turned out to be the eighth seeded UC Irvine Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In terms of moving forward, UCR can still set its sights on a legitimate playoff run if it focuses on improving its record in conference play and dedicating itself to winning games not just at home, but also while on the road.</p>\n<p>With a playmaker like senior guard Michelle Curry running the show and redshirt sophomore forward Skyler Lewis collecting the boards, UCR definitely has the talent to right the ship.</p>\n<p>Curry averages 15.5 points per game, fourth best mark in the conference while Lewis averages 7.6 rebounds per game, also the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, the Highlanders are the sixth seed, but conference play has just begun and there is plenty of time to improve, especially since UCR is not too far behind Cal State Fullerton in the standings. If their conference play begins to excel, they can make a splash in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Coming off its most recent win against the CSUF at home in which senior guard Lauren Holt dropped 22 points, UCR is set to ride that momentum when it takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 18</em><em>, 2018</em><em>, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/","id":846,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[845,844,843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Suffer First Conf.

Santa Barbara’s four-game win streak was effectively snapped by the Anteaters as Irvine outscored the Gauchos by 9 points in the second half to take the victory.

Against Irvine, Toler did a bit of everything for the Gauchos, recording 9 points, 5 assists, and 5 boards.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first quarter of play found Santa Barbara and Irvine both struggling to efficiently find the net, shooting a combined 11 for 34 from the field. While the Gauchos also went 1-6 from beyond the arc in the first, Drew Edelman went to work in the paint, scoring 9 of her team-high 18 points in the decently-even quarter. Morgan Green got to the line with 11 seconds left to knock down two free throws to put Irvine behind 17-18 heading into the second.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the second, Drew Toler scored 7 of her 9 points as Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to just 14 points. The Gauchos went on a scoring drought that last over three minutes, but threes by Tal Sahar and Toler towards the end of the first half extended their lead to 37-31.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">In the third, it was Irvine making the push, as the Anteaters held Santa Barbara to 14 points and closed out the quarter on an 8-0 run thanks to Morgan Green and Lauren Saiki.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Green and Saiki each scored 8 points in the third. Green finished the night with a game-high 25 points and 6 rebounds. The run by the Anteaters gave Irvine a 53-51 lead going into the final 10 minutes of play.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">In a high-scoring fourth quarter, Irvine outscored the Gauchos 24-23 to complete the comeback effort. Although UCSB closed out the game with their last 12 points coming from three pointers, the Anteaters managed to make all 8 of their free throws in the fourth to keep in front of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yazzy Sa’Dullah knocked down two from the line with 18 seconds left to put the Anteaters up 6. Sarah Porter managed to hit a three with 2 seconds remaining as part of her 8-point quarter, but it was too late for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing only by 3 points, Santa Barbara has to be disappointed, but the continual growth of the Gauchos this season is perhaps a silver lining head coach Bonnie Henrickson can find in this game. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos matched the Anteaters in many aspects and even held the advantage in the paint as well as in terms of bench production. UCSB outscored Irvine 28-22 down low and got 26 points from its bench, but the difference in the game seemed to be free-throws. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the Anteaters managed to go 18 for 23 from the charity stripe, the Gauchos only made 8 of their 15 free throws. Santa Barbara with its 23 personal fouls committed marks a season-high for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite giving Irvine 18 points from free-throws, UCSB’s offense has now scored 70 points or higher in 5 of its last 6 games. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Drew Edelman with another double-double is almost averaging one with 14 ppg and 9.4 rebounds per game. As Santa Barbara’s offense is rolling, the Gauchos will likely work on their defensive game-plan this week before playing Thursday in an effort to cut down on fouls. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the Gauchos work Drea Toler back into games, Santa Barbara will aim to get back on track at home against UC Davis on Thursday, January 18.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Directly after, the Gauchos struck back by going on a powerful 9-0 run to gain a three-point lead.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The score was tied once again at the end of the third quarter, all knotted up at 56.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The visitors opened up the forth on an 8-0 run, which included three pointers being scored by both freshman guard Sarah Bates and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar, with Bates again contributing 2 more points to cap off the run.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">CSUN wouldn’t lie down, though, as they kept the game close. Calling a timeout with 32 ticks on the clock left to play, Cal State Northridge went to their junior center Channon Fluker, who intensified the closeness of the game by scoring a clutch layup to create a 73-70 score at 20 seconds, UCSB still holding the lead.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After the score, sophomore guard Hayley Tanabe forced a turnover for the Gauchos and came up with the pivotal steal in crunch time and called a timeout immediately after the grab.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Down three points and going for the tie, the Matadors put the game in the hands of their junior guard Claudia Ramos, who’s three-point attempt ended up missing the mark.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After the three-pointer from Ramos fell short, Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman snagged the rebound. Upon grabbing the board, Edelman was fouled by Fluker.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">While at the charity stripe, Edelman missed her initial free throw attempt, but drained the second free throw with just four seconds left to play in regulation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The home team, with possession and no timeouts left, quickly inbounded the ball and gave it to Ramos, who splashed in a three-pointer to beat the final buzzer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Though exciting, the basket by Ramos was futile, as the final score was officially 74-73 at the end of regulation – with Santa Barbara taking the win.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">While UCSB had a slightly better field goal percentage (40.0%) than the Matadors (39.4%), the home team also won some standout stats the sheet. The most notable discrepancy between the Gauchos and their opponents was the domination of the points in the paint by the home team.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">CSUN scored a tremendous 48 points in the paint, compared to the less than half 22 points Santa Barbara had scored in the paint.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the game, Bates exploded for a team-leading 23 points for UCSB, going 6-11 from the field and shooting 5-7 from beyond the arc. Bates also led her team in assists, dishing out 5 dimes during regulation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior small forward Chaya Durr grabbed 9 boards, tying Matador junior center Channon Fluker for the game high in rebounds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For CSUN, senior forward Tessa Boagni scored a game-high 25 points, and her teammate Tanabe dispensed a game-high seven assists.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sitting at 3-0 in the conference, Santa Barbara looks to hold onto their streak in the Big West this weekend as they face UC Irvine on the road at Bren Events Center on Saturday January 13 at 7:00pm.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

On Saturday night against UC Riverside, the Gauchos almost did it again.</p>\n<p>Just two nights removed from a heartbreaking 80-79 loss to the Mustangs, the Gauchos picked up their first Big West win of the season against the Highlanders by a score of 65-57, pushing UCSB to 12-4 overall and 1-1 in league play.</p>\n<p>Eight minutes into their game against Cal Poly on Thursday, it seemed as though the Gauchos were destined to pick up their first league win in their first try. The Mustangs had no answer for UCSB, which jumped out to a 23-2 lead with 12:54 remaining in the first half.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The early Gaucho offensive explosion was driven by a balanced offensive attack. Six different players scored in that 23-2 run, and four players ended the first half with at least five points.</p>\n<p>The last ten minutes of the first half were markedly different from the first. Cal Poly ran off a 20-5 run at the end of the half to cut the Gaucho lead to 40-36 at halftime, as the hosts scored only eight points in the last eight minutes.</p>\n<p>While the first half was defined by two opposing runs, the second half was back-and-forth on a more microscopic level. With 13 lead changes in the second half alone, neither team was willing to let the other rest.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty had the hot hand in the second half, shooting 8-10 from the field for 17 points, one for each minute he played in the period. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger, normally the Gauchos’ most dependable and prolific scorer, was comparatively cold in going 2-10 for nine points in the last 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>For all his second half struggles, however, Heidegger made the shot his team needed him to. After Donovan Fields layup brought the Mustangs into a 77-77 tie, Heidegger buried a tough midrange jumper to give UCSB a 79-77 lead with exactly one second remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>Up two with just one clock tick to go, all the Gauchos had to do in order to secure their fourth win in a row and first in Big West play was to contest any last-second shot without fouling. They were unsuccessful in doing so.</p>\n<p>Fields, inbounding the ball, ran the baseline and hit Luke Meikle with a long pass over halfcourt. Meikle used his time wisely, getting Canty in the air with a pumpfake and drawing a three-shot foul with a desperation heave.</p>\n<p>Three clutch free throws and one missed full court shot later, and the Mustangs had completed their comeback in dramatic fashion with a 80-79 victory.</p>\n<p>Canty’s unfortunate foul didn’t diminish his standout performance on Thursday night. The forward led UCSB with 21 points and six blocks, and added 10 rebounds for his second double-double in a row.</p>\n<p>Leland King II was the Gauchos’ leading rebounder with 15 boards, his best rebounding performance of the season. King also had 12 points, giving him his third double-double in a row.</p>\n<p>Coming off such a brutal loss as the one they suffered on Thursday night, the Gauchos needed a strong bounce back showing on Saturday against the Highlanders. They got exactly that, thanks largely to a dominant game from King.</p>\n<p>The graduate transfer had 17 points in the first half alone on Saturday in the Thunderdome, and finished with 22 on the night. His 13 rebounds gave King his fourth double-double in a row, and helped the Gauchos overcome a quiet 2-point night from Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Neither team shot the ball particularly well from the field, as UCSB shot 39 percent while UCR shot 38 percent, but the Gauchos made up for it with 11 made threes on 28 attempts. Five of those threes came off the fingertips of Heidegger, who was second on the team with 19 points.</p>\n<p>Despite leading by 24 points with just 16 minutes to play, the Gauchos came close to blowing yet another massive lead. Riverside’s DJ Sylvester sank a layup with 5:06 remaining to make the score 56-51 but a couple of Heidegger three pointers boosted the lead back into more comfortable territory for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Highlander forward Alex Larsson was his team’s most efficient contributor with 10 points on 5-10 shooting, and his 11 rebounds gave the 6-10 senior a double-double of his own. Sylvester, at 4-13 from the field, was far less efficient, but still managed to lead Riverside with 13 points.</p>\n<p>After playing two games in three days, the Gauchos now get a whole week off in order to prepare for a road game in Hawaii on Saturday, when they’ll take on the Rainbow Warriors.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB women’s team survived a late Cal Poly comeback effort on Saturday to open the first week of Big West play 2-0. Starting the fourth quarter the Gauchos were ahead of the Mustangs by 19 points, but a Mustang effort to make the game interesting prompted a 14-2 run during a stretch in the final quarter. Without a field goal for over four minutes, the Gauchos were lucky enough to make enough free throws in the end, coming out on top 73-68.</p>\n<p>Although conference season is far from over, the Gauchos now sit at second in the Big West behind fellow 2-0 UC Davis. After starting the season 1-9, Santa Barbara, now 5-9,  has won its last four games, effectively turning the season around for conference play. Head coach Bonnie Henrickson knows there’s still room for improvement, “We aren’t where we were, we aren’t where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly’s comeback effort falling short, the Mustangs settle back in to .500, 1-1 in the Big West and 7-7 overall. Cal Poly’s senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who came into the game off a 40-point performance in an overtime win over UC Riverside, had a game-high 30 points on 27 shots at the Thunderdome. In an off night shooting for Leaupepe and her teammates, Cal Poly finished the game 26 for 70 from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first quarter of play found both teams locked at 0-0 until the 6:42 mark, when Makala Roper drove the lane and finished, giving the Gauchos the 2-0 lead. Roper, a senior, had 7 of her 15 points in the first quarter, and finished the game with a career high 9 assists. Bringing defensive energy early, Santa Barbara held the Mustangs to just 8 points off 18 percent shooting in the quarter, leading 11-8 heading into the second.</p>\n<p>“I know everything can get flustered,” said Roper post-game, “and I’m the point guard so I need to make sure everyone’s calm. I have to make sure to have a level head so everything is okay.”</p>\n<p>Despite Cal Poly’s terrible shooting effort in the first, the Mustangs continued to put pressure on Santa Barbara in a variety of press and trap defenses. Obviously feeling this pressure, the Gauchos turned the ball over 8 times in the first quarter alone and went on to turn it over 7 more times in the second.</p>\n<p>In the high-octane second quarter, Santa Barbara outscored Cal Poly 28-16 to take a 39-24 going into halftime. The Gauchos had no problem finding the net, shooting over 60 percent overall and from downtown. Dynn Leaupepe put her team on her back in the quarter, scoring 13 of her team’s 16 points, but it wasn’t enough to counter the Gauchos’ weapon off the bench: Tal Sahar. Sahar, who didn’t log a single minute in the team’s victory over Long Beach on Thursday, came alive in the second to score all of her 17 points in the quarter. The redshirt sophomore said after the game, “From the first shot I took, I was like, okay, this is going to be a good game.” Sahar’s energy was part of an 11-2 UCSB run to open the quarter, forcing a Mustang timeout.</p>\n<p>Senior Chaya Durr spoke following the game, addressing Sahar’s contribution. “Tal came in with great minutes off the bench and got us hyped up as well,” Durr said, “She was knocking down shots and we were just feeding off of it. It was just working.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had another hot quarter in the third, shooting 50 percent from three. While Dynn Leaupepe herself scored another 7 in the quarter, Sarah Bates and Chaya Durr each had 8 for UCSB and Roper added 6 as the Gauchos outscored the Mustangs 24-20. Durr finished the game with 10 points and 8 boards, hitting a three at the buzzer to put her team up 63-44 heading into the final quarter.</p>\n<p>Up by 19 with just 10 minutes left to play, the Gauchos seemed in control. After the Mustangs hit a pair of threes, Drew Edelman made a layup with 6:50 left to give Santa Barbara a comfortable 17-point lead. With 11 points and a game-high 10 boards, Edelman finished with a double-double on an efficient 5 of 7 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs refused to go away, though, organizing a trapping press defense that flustered the Gauchos. Facing the pressure, Santa Barbara lost possession a total 10 times in the fourth to record a season-high 33 turnovers on the night. The Mustangs took advantage of Santa Barbara’s mistakes, scoring 39 points off turnovers over the course of the game, but it wasn’t until the final quarter that Cal Poly closed the gap. An 11-0 Poly run forced a UCSB timeout with just 2:55 remaining, the Gauchos now only ahead 67-61. Their 19-point lead diminished to just 6, the Gauchos regrouped during the timeout to extend their lead to 8 off a Roper jumpshot. In desperation mode, the Mustangs got a quick three-ball and a layup to fall, moving within three of the Gauchos, 66-69 with just under 2 minutes to go. With 55 seconds left, Sarah Bates got to the rim with a nice move for an and-one. The freshman guard, who finished with 17, completed the three-point play to give her team the 72-66 point lead. With time running out, Cal Poly was forced to fire up some quick shots, but it was too little, too late. The Gauchos survived the comeback effort, holding on to win 73-68.</p>\n<p>With 33 turnovers, the Gauchos’ win over Cal Poly has some areas of concern for head coach Bonnie Henrickson, but also some positives. “Clearly, we’ve got to be better with more poise and composure,” said Henrickson, “I thought Chaya [Durr] defensively was really good on Dynn [Leaupepe], I thought our scouting report defense was really good.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now have two road games ahead of them, versus CSU Northridge and UC Irvine this coming week. On a winning streak and still making improvements, 2-0 Santa Barbara is certainly eager to continue Big West play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/","id":819,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[818,817,816],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast 49ers in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"The Big West season is officially underway, and the UCSB women's basketball team has its first win.

The Gauchos have now won their last three games and with Thursday night’s win over the 49ers Santa Barbara is 1-0 in conference play, improving their overall record to 4-9. While UCSB is rolling compared to the start of the season, the 49ers are pushed to a dismal 2-13 overall as they open league play with their sixth straight loss.</p>\n<p>A rematch of last year’s Big West Championship, in which Long Beach got the best of the Gauchos, Thursday night’s game opened with an energy in the Thunderdome signaling the return of conference-play atmosphere. The 49ers pressured Santa Barbara using a 3-2 zone along with a full-court press disrupting the Gauchos’ offense early. Shots weren’t falling easily for either team and the Gauchos had a difficult time keeping possession, turning the ball over 7 times in the first quarter alone.</p>\n<p>For nearly the first seven minutes of play, UCSB had only 3 points off a Drew Edelman free throw and a jumper by Danae Miller. The defensive battle had the score locked at 5-3 Long Beach before Makala Roper knocked down a three for the Gauchos with 3:38 remaining. A few back and forth buckets closed out the quarter 12-12.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson said following the game, “Sometimes you’ve got to be able to handle that this might one of those nights, it might be in the forties and fifties and you’ve got to be comfortable doing that,” said Henrickson, “You’ve got to be able to play through that and still win in the fifties.”</p>\n<p>Makala Roper got things going for Santa Barbara in the second quarter, draining her second three ball of the night to put the Gauchos ahead 15-12. Long Beach responded by going on an 8-0 run, forcing head coach Bonnie Henrickson to call a quick timeout with roughly 6:04 remaining. Out of the 30-second timeout, the Gauchos went inside to find Edelman in back to back possessions for two easy buckets. Edelman asserted herself in the paint throughout the game, getting good position as well as good looks at the basket, but had a hard time getting shots to fall. The redshirt senior did have a career night rebounding the ball, grabbing 23 boards while just missing a double-double with 9 points. Roper kept heating up, making another shot from beyond the arc to put the Gauchos down a single point heading into halftime 22-23.</p>\n<p>The first half of play featured both squads struggling to find the net, as UCSB and Long Beach each shot close to 31 percent overall and 27 percent from three-point territory. Edelman had 13 of her final 23 rebounds at half, but UCSB also committed 13 turnovers in the half.</p>\n<p>In spite of their rough start shooting, the Gauchos came out after halftime with a re-focused energy on both ends of the court. Santa Barbara opened the third on a 9-0 run, holding the 49ers scoreless for almost 5 minutes. UCSB went on to score 17 total points in the quarter, with Sarah Bates, Sarah Porter and again Roper chipping in a three-pointer each. Roper’s three came at the buzzer to lift the Gauchos to a 39-28 advantage after three quarters of play. The 49ers had a rough quarter to say the least, going 1-10 from the field, 0-4 from three, and 3-10 from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Makala Roper made another three to kick off the fourth quarter for her game and season-high 15 points, all from beyond the arc. Long Beach guard Shanijah Davison got to the line on the following possession, converting 1 of 2 free throws. The freshman Davison had a difficult night, shooting only 1-10 from the field and finishing the game with 4 points. Heading into the game, Davison was the 49ers’ leading scorer with 11.9 points per game. 49er Cecily Wilson knocked down 1 of 2 shots from the line shortly after Davison, but the Gauchos answered with an Akilah Jennings three to take their largest lead of the night, up 15, with 8:50 remaining.</p>\n<p>Down 45-30 with just 8:50 left, 49ers refused to back off as Long Beach upped their defensive pressure to disrupt the Gauchos. After Akilah jennings made a nice move to the basket for a bucket at the 6:51 mark, the Gauchos failed to make another shot aside from free throws. Long Beach used their defensive stops to generate offense, going on a 10-0 run over the next 6 minutes to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 3. Cecily Wilson had 7 of her team-high 9 points in the fourth to go with her team-high 10 rebounds. Down 47-44 with 53 seconds left, Long Beach mistakenly fouled Sarah Bates, sending her to the line where she knocked down the two free throws. Sloppy play and a variety of weird calls by the referees found the 49ers forced to send Bates to the line again with only 3 seconds to go. Bates came up clutch at the line again, hitting both shots to give the Gauchos the 51-44 victory.</p>\n<p>After the game, the freshman guard Bates discussed her team’s improved play in the third quarter. “I think we got a little more used to the pressure, but we were still struggling with it. It was our offense more than their defense, even though they’re a good defensive team,” said Bates.</p>\n<p>Following the Gauchos’ 1-9 start in the regular season, the Gauchos finally have momentum and a growing identity when they play. “I mean it’s a lot better than being 1-9,” said Drew Edelman, “We have a little bit more confidence going in. Especially now that it’s conference play, we said, ‘Ok whatever our record was preseason ultimately it doesn’t matter, it’s all about conference.’”</p>\n<p>With a big game against rival Cal Poly on Saturday, Santa Barbara is hoping to carry its energy further into conference play. “It was a process, we’ve learned from it. So now, new season, we’re 1 and 0,” continued Edelman.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson is looking to continue her team’s growth this season, as beating the now 2-13 49ers is not as daunting as a task as beating Cal Poly. “So, we’re fortunate to find a way to win, but that locker room is mature enough to know we weren’t very good and we’ve got to be better on Saturday, and we’ll get a chance to be better on  Saturday,” said Henrickson, “And we’re mature enough to recognize that.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry game Saturday afternoon, with tip-off scheduled for 2:00pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80396\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80396\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/","id":781,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[780,779,778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Host Long Beach and Cal Poly to Open Big West Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-14-17_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-14-17_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The start of conference play just might be the best complement to UCSB recent win streak as it heads home to host LBSU and Cal Poly.

Thursday’s game against the 49ers seems like it will be a favorable matchup for UCSB, as Long Beach is in the midst of a five-game slide and sit at 2-12 overall this season.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their sub-par record, the 49ers are being led by promising freshman Shanaijah Davison. The 5’8 guard is averaging a team-high 11.9 points per game, and put up 29 points versus USC earlier this season.</p>\n<p>With seven freshmen on the Long Beach roster, another promising player has been 6’5 center Emma Merriweather. Only a freshman, Merriweather has recorded an impressive 22 total blocks in addition to averaging 9.2 points and 5.7 boards per contest. Long Beach will be eager to snap their losing streak when it faces UCSB, but the Gauchos have some talent on their roster as well.</p>\n<p>As a redshirt senior, forward Drew Edelman hasn’t slowed down, leading the Gauchos through their rough patch with 15.2 points and just over 8 rebounds per game. Edelman has performed closer to her ability lately, posting a 25 and 10 double-double in Santa Barbara’s win over San Diego State while she continues to be a vocal leader for her team on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB has some promising freshmen of its own, with first-year guard Sarah Bates coming up big in recent contests. Bates has scored in double figures in her last two games and is playing big minutes as a freshman, averaging a little over 25 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest between the 49ers and Gauchos will interestingly enough be a repeat of last year’s Big West Tournament championship game. Long Beach squeaked out the win over UCSB in a nail-biter, so the Gauchos are likely eager to redeem themselves on top of extending their winning streak.</p>\n<p>The action will tip off at the Thunderdome on Thursday, Jan. 4 at 7 p.m. as UCSB looks to earn just its second home victory this season.</p>\n<p>Win or lose against the 49ers on Thursday, Santa Barbara will have a short break before hosting rival Cal Poly at the Thunderdome for an afternoon contest on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have had their respective ups and downs this season, sitting at the .500 mark with a 6-6 record. Cal Poly will visit UC Riverside Thursday before heading to the Thunderdome. The Mustangs have been led by the senior duo of sisters Dynn and Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>The Leaupepe duo features Dynn scoring 15.7 ppg and Lynn averaging a close 14.1 ppg. UCSB was torched by Dynn in last year’s January game, as she scored a season-high 29 points in the Mustang victory so the Santa Barbara coaching staff will undoubtedly work towards containing her on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry game will tip off at 2 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 6 as the Gauchos and Mustangs will both be looking for bragging rights in addition to improving their records.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/","id":770,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[769,768,767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB End Non-Conf.

It was clear immediately that the Pioneers didn’t stand much of a chance of pulling off the upset.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held a 21-10 lead just ten minutes into the game, and managed to open up that advantage to 36-18 by halftime. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger led the Gaucho offense with 11 points in those first twenty minutes despite an uncharacteristically poor shooting performance, going 5-12 from the field and 1-5 from three in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t shoot particularly well from the field Saturday night, but that didn’t seem to matter much. The Gauchos shot 44 percent from the field, but were a shaky 26.1 percent from beyond the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Much of UCSB’s first half dominance can be attributed to its mastery of the boards. The Gauchos pulled down 36 first half rebounds to Pacific Union’s 15, with graduate transfer Leland King II leading the way with 11 rebounds in the first half for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty and sophomore guard Christian Terrell also got in on the rebound party, as both players grabbed seven boards in the first 20 minutes. Prior to Saturday’s game, Terrell’s season high for rebounds was seven, set back on Dec. 5 against Nebraska-Omaha.</p>\n<p>None of the Gauchos’ first-half starters played more than five minutes in the second half, but that doesn’t mean the hosts took their feet off the gas pedal. UCSB scored 45 points in the second half alone, and saw every player that entered the game score.</p>\n<p>J.D. Slajchert was one of those players, and the junior forward made the most of his season-high 10 minutes of play. Slajchert scored a season-best six points on 2-for-5 shooting, and knocked down one free throw.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos had nine players finish with at least five points, a balanced offensive attack that was key to their second-half scoring efforts. Heidegger’s 16 points led the way, but King II and Canty weren’t far behind with 10 each, as both players posted a double-double on the night as well.</p>\n<p>Jayson Marquez was Pacific Union’s only player in double-digit points Saturday night, although Rae Hubbard finished one point shy with nine points. Forward Noel Briones led all Pioneers with nine rebounds, third-best across both teams, but a 1-7 night from the field limited him to just two points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to stretch its three-game win streak out a bit more as it enters Big West play on Thursday, Jan. 4 at Cal Poly. The Mustangs are 5-9 on the season, but have a strong 85-82 loss to Cal on their resume.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take Cal Poly on Thursday night at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/","id":767,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[766,765,764],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Tally Back-to-Back Wins for First Time This Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team seems to be reaching its expected potential as it won its second-straight game.

At the start of the second quarter, the home team went bucket-for-bucket with their opponents, but eventually fell short as UCSB went on a striking 6-0 run to put New Mexico State down 19 points with the score being 35-16, Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Shortly before the end of the half, junior forward Baylee Robinson stopped the bleeding of the Gaucho offensive aggression, by scoring a basket for the Aggies with 6:10 remaining in the second quarter. That basket was the last basket of the first half for the home team, though, as New Mexico was outscored 26-6 in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Defense was an immense factor in the game, as UCSB smashed the Aggies on the battle of the boards, outrebounding the home team 47-32. Santa Barbara held their opponents to an 18-point first half, creating the separation they needed to approach the half with a handsome lead.</p>\n<p>It was a 50-18 lead for the visiting team at the half, and the Gauchos made sure not to let the break cool them off, as they went on an 8-0 run to open the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The visitors steamrolled their way into the fourth period, in command of a 39-point deficit with the score sitting at 67-28 in their favor.</p>\n<p>While New Mexico State did manage to ignite their offense, and outscore UCSB 19-10 in the fourth quarter, their resistance to feat was futile as it was simply not enough to overcome their opponents.</p>\n<p>Bench play has proven to be a bright spot for UCSB yet again, as the bench stats were asymmetrical, in favor of Santa Barbara. The bench of the road team outscored the Aggies 32-7.</p>\n<p>Porter led her team in scoring, contributing a booming 17 points, Bates added 11 to the score, and redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman hit her typical double-digit game by sprinkling in 10 points.</p>\n<p>Freshman center Natalia Bruening grabbed a career-high 12 rebounds, while freshman guard Danae Miller dished out six assists, leading the game in dimes. All Gauchos that played in the game got a chance to score a bucket and grab at least one rebound, solidifying their attempt at a balanced attack.</p>\n<p>New Mexico State’s freshman guard Brooke Salas gave her team a much needed 18 points, which was a game high, while her teammate sophomore forward Jasmine Cooper was second in scoring for her team lending 14 points to the score.</p>\n<p>UCSB will open up its Big West Conference journey at home in the Thunderdome, against Long Beach State on Jan, 4 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80338\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80338\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/","id":766,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[765,764,763],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sting Hornets With Double-Digit Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Things keep rolling for the Gauchos as they strung together another win Saturday night over Sac St. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_80287\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"601702107\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80337\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80287\" data-attachment-id=\"80287\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/christian-terrell-leaps-to-the-hoop-to-dunk-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christian Terrell leaps to the hoop to dunk.

That positive momentum was evident early on Saturday evening.</p>\n<p>Sacramento State eked out an early lead initially, thanks to a couple baskets from Izayah Mauriohooho-Le’afa. Before the Hornets could get too far ahead, however, the Gauchos reeled them back and grabbed the lead in with a couple of Leland King II three pointers, both assisted by Marcus Jackson.</p>\n<p>UCSB would never relinquish the advantage for the rest of Saturday’s game, but it took the team a while to open up a comfortable margin. Five points from Ami Lakoju, and another two assists from Jackson, pushed the Gauchos to a 20-14 lead, but the Hornets battled back to tie the game back up at 26 with six minutes to go in the first half.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, UCSB had managed to open up only a one-point lead at 31-30. Then, a Gabe Vincent jumpshot opened up the floodgates.</p>\n<p>Jackson was integral to the Gauchos’ half-closing 13-2 run. The graduate transfer knocked down two threes and set up Max Heidegger for a layup, all of which combined to give UCSB its first double-digit lead of the game at 41-30. One minute later, the horn sounded and the Gauchos decamped for the locker room with a 44-32 lead.</p>\n<p>A layup by Sac State’s Justin Patton kicked off the second-half scoring, and brought the Hornets to within ten, but that was as close as they would get for the majority of the last 20 minutes. The Gauchos kept their hosts at a consistent arms-reach throughout the period, never letting the margin grow too thin.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty shouldered the bulk of the UCSB offensive load in the second half. Canty scored all 15 of his points in the period, as he rebounded from a tough 0-4 first half to go 6-9 from the field in the second.</p>\n<p>Canty finished with nine rebounds to go with his 15 points, leaving him just one rebound shy of a double-double. His frontcourt mate Leland King II earned that distinction instead with his 11 points and 12 rebounds, his sixth such performance this season.</p>\n<p>Heidegger led all scorers Saturday with 23 points, an achievement that has become fairly wrote for the sophomore shooting guard at this point in the season. Heidegger benefited greatly from the vision and generosity of point guard Jackson, who finished with a game-high eight assists and 13 points.</p>\n<p>Sacramento State trailed by as much as 18 points in the second-half, but the Hornets hassled the Gauchos until the final horn.</p>\n<p>Jordan Tolbert and Justin Strings, with 13 and 14 points in the second half, respectively, were crucial in Sac State’s late game push to draw back within ten points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a week off before their next game, a home contest against Pacific Union at 7:00 pm. The Athletics are an NAIA squad, and are 2-7 this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80337\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80337\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/","id":765,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[764,763,762],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Turn Things Around, Defeat Aztecs at Home to End Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"The drought finally ends for the UCSB women's basketball team after defeating SDSU.

After winning the tip, the Aztecs got things rolling with a Khalia Lark jumper. Lark later hit a three to score five of her team-high 14 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struggled offensively yet again in the first period of play, managing to score only 7 points. Sarah Bates got the Gauchos on the board to tie the game at 2-2, her only points of the quarter.</p>\n<p>A layup and a pair of free throws from redshirt senior Drew Edelman plus a single free throw by Chaya Durr rounded out the Santa Barbara 7-point effort. The Gauchos gave up an 8-1 run to the Aztecs to end the quarter, finding themselves down 16-7 and the subjects of an animated speech from their head coach. In the quarter, Santa Barbara shot a dismal 15.4 field goal percentage while going 0-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke to her team’s performance after the game; “Sometimes you’ve got to find a way to win and remember how to win, it’s been a while. We’re capable of so much more, we’ve practiced well through all of this.”</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start and disappointing first quarter, the Gauchos turned things around in a major way in the second quarter. Shooting a much-improved 64.3 percent and going 5-of-8 from three-point land helped Santa Barbara put the Aztecs on their heels and take the lead going into halftime.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed energy on the defensive end, getting stops to build momentum as more of their shots fell on the other end. Locking down defensively, UCSB held SDSU to only 10 points in the quarter and forced the Aztecs to shoot 35.7 percent from the field. With 6:45 remaining in the half, Edelman got a layup to go off a nice feed from Sarah Bates to put the Gauchos within a point, 18-17.</p>\n<p>The teams traded buckets until close to the end of the quarter, when Henrickson subbed Tal Sahar into the game. Sahar entered the game with her team down 26-23 at the 2:13 mark. In the final minutes of the half, Sahar gave the Gauchos a 7-0 run to take their first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The redshirt sophomore leaked out twice for fast break layups and hit a corner three; however, Sahar would not return until the end of the game. UCSB went into halftime with plenty of momentum from their 23-point quarter, up on the Aztecs 30-26.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Edelman spoke to her team’s defensive intensity following the game.</p>\n<p>“Usually the ability to take shots isn’t our problem, it’s definitely on the defensive end,” she said. “We were able to get a lot more stops tonight than we have been able to in the previous nights and also our communication has gotten a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Only up by four at the start of the second half, Santa Barbara found a way to keep its foot on the gas, scoring 27 points in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>With starting freshman point guard Danae Miller getting in foul trouble early, senior guard Makala Roper was tasked with more minutes. Roper controlled the ball and was instrumental in working the ball into Edelman. Henrickson had high praise for her senior guard at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>“[Roper] was really good for really long stretches, I mean really good,” Henrickson said. “She made good decisions with the ball, let go of it, keep it, drive it at the rim, she was good.”</p>\n<p>Edelman herself had a dominant quarter, scoring 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the game with 11 points and a game-high 8 assists. With just over three minutes to go in the quarter, the game was close with the Gauchos up 45-40. Sarah Bates hit a three ball to extend the Santa Barbara lead to 8, then the Gauchos started pouring it on, going on a 12-0 run.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara rolling, SDSU was simply outmatched and looked dismantled. Edelman’s 15-point quarter was part of her season-high 25 points, and the talented forward pulled down 10 boards to record a double-double. Shooting 71.4 percent in the quarter, UCSB found itself up on the Aztecs 57-40 heading into the final ten minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter was SDSU’s best, as they score 24 points; however, it wasn’t enough to make the game interesting. Santa Barbara was outscored by four in the quarter, but the Gauchos converted 11 of 12 free throws to finish out the game and secure the victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates played the whole game for Santa Barbara, aside from going to the bench a few seconds before being summoned back due to foul trouble of her teammates. Bates was huge for her team in getting the win. The freshman had 15 points to go along with 7 boards and was a vocal leader on defense.</p>\n<p>In the first time since 1999, Santa Barbara defeated the Aztecs. SDSU struggled carrying out their game plan against the Gauchos, losing the battle in the paint by a ten-point deficit and being outrebounded 35-23.</p>\n<p>McKynzie Fort, the Aztecs’ leading scorer on the season, was handled well by the Santa Barbara defense, as she was held to just 10 points and a single rebound in 38 minutes.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now have a short break for the holidays before returning to action for its last non-conference game against New Mexico State next Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/","id":747,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[746,745,744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Gets Back On Track With Victory Over San Diego Christian","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite its loss to USC, the UCSB men's basketball team overcame the defeat with a win over San Diego Christian. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At first blush, San Diego Christian doesn’t seem like too much of a test for the UCSB men’s basketball team. After all, the Hawks are an NAIA team, with a 2-6 record and a handful of losses to teams much worse than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>When the Hawks entered the Thunderdome on Tuesday night, however, they found a UCSB team in a potentially dangerous situation. With the Gauchos only two days removed from a tough, streak-snapping loss to a high-profile USC team, Tuesday’s game was a serious test of UCSB’s mental ability to bounce back from defeat.</p>\n<p>Within the first ten minutes, it was clear that the Gauchos were bound to pass with flying colors. UCSB jumped out to a 30-12 lead by the 10:00 mark of the first half, and coasted to an 87-69 win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite playing only 21 minutes, sophomore guard Max Heidegger led all Gaucho scorers with 19 points on 8-for-12 shooting, and knocked down a team-high three three’s. Forwards Jalen Canty (12 points and six rebounds) and Leland King II (11 points and seven rebounds) broke the Hawks down from the inside in similarly limited minutes.</p>\n<p>For about four minutes, it seemed as though UCSB had fallen into the trap of overlooking San Diego Christian. The Hawks stayed level with the Gauchos, even taking a 10-8 lead on a pair of Derek Novsek free throws.</p>\n<p>Two more Novsek free throws got the Hawks to 12 points, but those free throws came four minutes later, at the 12:13 mark. In the interim, UCSB had jetted off on an 18-0 run to claim a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>Heidegger’s 19 first-half points were key to UCSB’s performance in the first twenty minutes, as the sophomore was twelve points ahead of any other scorer on the floor in the half. Senior guard Gabe Vincent was a strong second option with eight points and three assists in his 13 minutes of first-half action.</p>\n<p>The margin stayed about the same from that point until halftime, which the Gauchos went into holding a 50-33 lead. Immediately upon returning from the intermission, however, UCSB broke the game well and truly open.</p>\n<p>Playing with primarily second-unit players, the Gauchos extended their lead to 77-44 by about the ten-minute mark. Forward Ami Lakoju was particularly instrumental in UCSB’s second-half dominance, as the junior chipped in 12 points, tied for his career-high, and five rebounds in just 14 minutes of action.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Brandon Davis saw an extra-heavy dose of playing time thanks to the blowout as well as a night off for point guard Marcus Jackson, and Davis responded with a career-high nine points on 4-for-6 shooting.</p>\n<p>A 33-point lead with less than ten minutes to go is more or less an unbridgeable chasm of a lead, but the Hawks did their absolute best to string that bridge together. San Diego Christian closed the game on a 23-6 run to bring the deficit back under 20, but was ultimately unable to truly threaten UCSB’s cushion.</p>\n<p>San Diego’s Novsek and Frederick Hayden led all scorers with 21 and 22 points, respectively. Both players scored ten points in the second half alone, providing the dual scoring threats the Hawks needed to claw back within 20 points of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB travels north to take on Sacramento State on Saturday in Sacramento at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80336\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80336\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/","id":205,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[204,203,202],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Reeling Gauchos Host Aztecs In Hopes of Earning First Home Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"Losers of nine straight, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to pick up their second win of the season hosting San Diego State on Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_80012\" style=\"width: 485px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"559859990\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80294\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80012\" data-attachment-id=\"80012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/danae-miller-moves-the-ball-up-the-court-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?fit=900%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,596\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Danae Miller moves the ball up the court.

In comparison to the youthful Santa Barbara lineup, the SDSU starters are predominantly seniors, with guard McKynzie Fort leading the charge for the Aztecs.</p>\n<p>Fort is a 5’9 guard and has led her team in scoring in 7 of SDSU’s games this season, averaging team high numbers in points as well as rebounding. In addition to her 16.4 points per game, Fort averages 5.4 boards per contest.</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs will certainly rely on production from their seniors, Santa Barbara will look to build off the performance against LMU Monday.</p>\n<p>Disregarding the final score, the Gauchos outscored the Lions in the second half and found success feeding the ball to Drew Edelman, who finished with 21 points and 8 boards on an efficient 9-13 shooting.</p>\n<p>When Edelman is having those types of games, it seems the Gauchos have an easier time on offense; however, Edelman’s success in the paint may simply be the result of Santa Barbara running its offense the way head coach Bonnie Henrickson desires.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has repeatedly stressed the need to swing the ball and find the open player, whether that equates to an open three or a feed inside.</p>\n<p>With two true freshman point guards in Danae Miller and Sarah Bates, Henrickson’s offense has taken time to be carried-out correctly, but UCSB is continuing to show glimpses of efficient ball movement.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the Santa Barbara roster averaging double-digit scoring is redshirt junior Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10.4 points a game despite shooting just 35 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>With almost every Gaucho on the UCSB roster playing at least 10 minutes per contest, each game brings the opportunity for players to give their team that necessary spark either off the bench or from the opening buzzer.</p>\n<p>Facing SDSU will be a good opportunity for the Gauchos to keep translating what they’ve been improving upon in practice to real-game scenarios against a more appropriate opponent than a top-ten team like UCLA.</p>\n<p>Showing progressive improvement, Santa Barbara has worked to cut down its turnover numbers, which have plagued the Gauchos much of this season.</p>\n<p>Averaging 16.7 turnovers per game, the Gauchos limited themselves to losing the ball only 11 times against LMU, their lowest number since the regular season opening win at Northern Arizona.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, UCSB showed more intensity on the defensive end facing LMU, recording 8 steals and forcing 19 turnovers. If Santa Barbara is able to build off of these improvements, the Gauchos may also solve their issue of slow starts.</p>\n<p>In their past three matchups, the Gauchos have failed to score more than 11 points in each first quarter, so Henrickson’s team will likely aim to get off to a better start against SDSU on Friday.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Aztecs hosted Santa Barbara and won by a margin of 14, so Friday’s matchup will also offer the Gauchos a chance at redemption.</p>\n<p>The action between UCSB and SDSU will tip off at 7:00 pm on Friday, December 22 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With no three-point efforts in the first period, the Lions ignited in the second going 4-for-4 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>One triple was scored by junior guard Andee Velasco, with the other three being secured by senior guard Makenzie Cast.</p>\n<p>With the home team pulling away, Porter hit a three-pointer just before the half ended, bringing UCSB’s deficit to a more manageable 34-26, going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Going bucket-for-bucket with the Lions in the third period, prevented the visitors from gaining any headway against their opponents.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman for UCSB and Cheyanne Wallace for the home-team, were each heavily engaged in the third.</p>\n<p>Edelman had another stellar double-digit performance, notching eight of her game-high 21 points in the third quarter. While Wallace contributed nine of her team-high 16 points in the third period for LMU.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter got interesting, as Santa Barbara began to close the gap, bringing the score within four.</p>\n<p>However, after the visiting team’s spark in the fourth, things suddenly changed with just under four minutes to play.</p>\n<p>The score was 62-58 with 3:58 left in regulation, when both teams began to fall short. Both UCSB and the Lions went a combined 0-for-10 from the field for the remainder of the period.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense was lacking, allowing Loyola Marymount to outscore them in 3 of the 4 quarters. However, they had a big fourth period, scoring 17 points over the Lions’ 14.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 36 percent from the field on 23-for-64 shooting, which lacked in comparison to LMU who shot 43 percent on 21-for-49 shooting.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s game-high 21 points gave Santa Barbara a much-needed offensive spike, along with Porter’s 17 points which consisted of four downtown baskets.</p>\n<p>The Lions had an astonishing four players who scored double digits; Makenzie Cast and redshirt junior Bree Alford gave the team 11, Andee Velasco drained 15, and Cheyanne Wallace had a dominant double-double, recording 16 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The home team conquered the battle of the boards, out rebounding the Gauchos 43-31.</p>\n<p>Beyond the arc was another defeat for UCSB, as they shot a total of 33 three-pointers, and only capitalized on eight of them, ending the night on 24.2 percent three-point shooting. Whereas LMU was more selective about their three-point shots, going for 12, and scoring on 5 of them – to complete 41 percent three-point shooting on the night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have another shot to end their losing skid, as they welcome the Aztecs at home this week.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face San Diego State (6-4) on Friday, December 22<sup>nd</sup> at the Thunderdome at 7pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/","id":204,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[203,202,201],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggles Continue Following Blowout Loss at No. 17 Oregon State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the second game of a three-match road trip, the Gauchos struggles continue as they have now dropped eight straight after 74-49 loss against the Beavers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As the Thomas Fire continues to rear its ugly head in the Santa Barbara area, the woes of regular season play are all too familiar for the UCSB Women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>With their 74-49 Saturday night loss to Oregon State at the Moda Center, the Gauchos extend their losing streak to eight games.

Center Marie Gulich added 6 in the quarter as part of her 10-point night to go along with 6 boards.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara regrouped during halftime and was able to put together a 19-point third quarter effort. Sarah Porter, a redshirt junior, scored all of her 6 points in the third.</p>\n<p>Two made jumpers by Sahar and then a Sarah Porter three-ball got things rolling for the Gauchos and cut the Beaver lead to 18; however, OSU maintained its composure to keep Santa Barbara at bay.</p>\n<p>OSU guard Aleah Goodman scored 8 of her game-high 17 points in the quarter and the Beavers shot 60 percent from three to subdue Santa Barbara’s brief attempts at making runs. The quarter ended with the Beavers up 62-37 and hopes of a UCSB comeback minimal.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter saw both teams score 12 points, despite much of those baskets falling during garbage time. With the sound of the final buzzer, OSU held on to beat Santa Barbara 74-49.</p>\n<p>On the night, UCSB held its own in the paint, tying the Beavers for 26 points in the paint and only being outrebounded 34-33.</p>\n<p>An issue for the Gauchos was perhaps their poor shooting effort, going only 22-66 from the field, but also the fact that they failed to reach the free throw line.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara committed 19 personal fouls, OSU was only called for 3 fouls. The Beavers shot 52.9 percent overall and 56.3 percent from three-point territory in an efficient night finding the net.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss to the Beavers, the Gauchos will turn around to face Loyola Marymount at LMU on Monday.</p>\n<p>The game, which was rescheduled from its original date of December 7th due to conditions created by the Thomas Fire, will tip off at 7:00pm.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to get their second win of the season against a talented LMU team and use their experiences against top-25 teams in moving forward.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80296\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80296\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/","id":202,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[201,200,199],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":40,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
