In the third inning, Altmeyer doubled again to score Johnston, who had singled and stole second. Altmeyer went 2-2 on the day at the plate and finished with two doubles, two RBI’s and was walked twice.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scored three more runs in the fourth without a single hit, as junior outfielder Kristen Clark and senior infielder Arianna Palomares both scored on bases loaded walks by Utah Valley pitchers.</p>\n<p>Gaucho freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin pitched well through three innings, holding the Wolverines without a hit.  However, in the fourth, things began to unravel for UCSB as Utah Valley scored three runs on three hits.</p>\n<p>The string of hits and scores led to Santa Barbara sending pitcher Lena Mayer on the mound in exchange for Gulvin. Towards the game’s ending, Ashley Ludlow closed out the game with four strikeouts in 1.2 inning of relief to pick up her fourth win of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite its win the previous day, UCSB’s play declined in its matchup on Saturday as it was unable to score a single run off of Iowa State, losing 2-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had only four hits in the game, all from Clark. Although its offense lacked of its usual production, UCSB ended Saturday’s loss with a solid pitching performance as Gulvin and freshman pitcher Ashley Wright combined for just two unearned runs on five hits.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came close to scoring in the first inning when Clark hit an infield single, eventually advancing to second on a sacrifice bunt by Palomares. However, that’s as far as the Cyclones would let her go as she couldn’t find her way to third.</p>\n<p>In the following game, the Gauchos lost to Mississippi State 5-2. The only two runs the Gauchos could score occurred during a rally in the third inning, in which consecutive singles and a sacrifice bunt put junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos and Clark into scoring position. A double into center field hit by Altmeyer brought both runners home.</p>\n<p>In attempt to bounce back from their loss earlier in the day, it looked hopeful for the Gauchos leading 2-1 in the third inning. But, that would be UCSB’s only lead of the game as Mississippi State got to starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow with four more runs in the sixth.</p>\n<p>Ludlow pitched a complete game while enduring her third loss of the season, giving up five runs, three of which were earned to go along with nine hits and five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to improve on its performance in this weekend’s upcoming San Diego Classic II.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69017\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69017\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/","id":1137,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1136,1135,1134],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season Ended in 88-76 Loss to Hawaii in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a historic ending to the regular season, the UCSB men's basketball team saw its nine-game winning streak come to an end in its 88-76 loss to Hawaii Friday night in the Big West Conference Tourna...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite a team-high 22 points from senior Michael Bryson, a 24-3 run opening the second half helped the University of Hawaii to defeat the UCSB men’s basketball team by a final score of 88-76 in the Semifinals Round of the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68937\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68937\" data-attachment-id=\"68937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/michael-bryson-pushes-the-ball-to-his-teammate-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Michael Bryson pushes the ball to his teammate.

The third-year guard tallied his third double-double of the season finishing with 19 points and ten boards. This was also Valdez’s third straight game with 18 points or more.</p>\n<p>Following a 27-17 outpour by Hawaii, Santa Barbara responded with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>Guard Gabe Vincent helped turn things around scoring seven points in the final four minutes of the first period. The sophomore answered a Jankovich three with a make form beyond the arc, helping trim UCSB’s deficit to one at 30-29.</p>\n<p>Vincent then took a strong drive to the rim and gave the Gauchos their first lead since the 15 minute mark of the game at 31-30. The Stockton, CA native shot 46.7 percent from the floor for 17 points. Santa Barbara finished 9-2 in conference play when Vincent shoots above 40 percent, both losses coming to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>While UCSB only trailed by three heading into the break, the Gauchos were unable to halt Hawaii’s 21-3 run ignited by senior guard Roderick Bobbitt.</p>\n<p>Connecting on three straight three-pointers to open up the second half, Bobbitt scored 12 of his total 21 points in the final 20 minutes of play helping Hawaii maintain its lead. The Oakland point guard contributed distributing the ball as well tallying four of his five assists in the second period and grabbing at total of six rebounds.</p>\n<p>A big margin of difference lied in Hawaii’s field goal percentage and trips to the line. The Warriors shot 52 percent from the floor as well as hitting 27-37 free throws. Santa Barbara, a team who has shown consistency at the line, finished 16-27 from the free throw line. The Gauchos also took 10 more shots than Hawaii, going 26-60 from the floor, but finished with 43.3 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Alex Hart gave a much needed boost off the bench for UCSB. The sophomore forward finished with a career-high 13 points, shooting a perfect 3-3 from three-point range. Eric Childress also played a role on the defensive end. The junior guard finished with a career-high six steals, four of which came in the first half including three-straight steals with six minutes to go.</p>\n<p>However, the efforts of both players would not be enough to prevent the Rainbow Warriors from securing their 88-76 victory. Hawaii will attempt to win the conference championship in hopes of earning its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2002.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/","id":330,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[329,328,327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Continue Home Dominance","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_6-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB looks to bounce back from its first series loss of the season when it faces off against the University of Hartford this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off its first series loss of the season after losing two of three to Oregon last weekend, the UCSB baseball team shifts its focus to another three-game series, this time against the University of Hartford.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68905\" style=\"width: 258px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68905\" data-attachment-id=\"68905\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-look-to-continue-home-dominance/ryan-clark-hits-the-ball-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_6-web.jpg?fit=795%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"795,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ryan Clark hits the ball.

It upset No. 19 UCLA at home and managed to take one game away from Caesar Uyesaka stadium against No. 9 Oregon after an exciting 1-0 match that went 14 innings.</p>\n<p>This weekend the Gauchos will hope to continue their dominance against non-conference opponents. Since 2014, they have gone 61-15-2 against those opponents outside the Big West.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has also been dominant at home since 2014, posting a .803 winning percentage when playing at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, the Hawks are led by catcher Erik Ostberg. The sophomore leads the team in batting average (.429), hits (12), and is tied for the team lead in RBI (5).</p>\n<p>Another solid sophomore for Hartford has been Ben Bengtson. The shortstop is second on the team in batting average (.412), first on the team in slugging percentage (.588), and also tied for first in RBI (5).</p>\n<p>However, Hartford will look to continue its great mound play this season in order to beat UCSB in this series. The pitching staff ranks 59<sup>th</sup> in the country in ERA (3.19), 23<sup>rd</sup> in hits per inning (6.62) and 14<sup>th</sup> in win-loss percentage (0.83).</p>\n<p>Its most dominant pitcher this season has been senior Kyle Gauthier. The right-handed pitcher currently boasts a 0.56 ERA which is tops on both his team and his conference. He will get the start on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to attack the Hawks tough pitching staff with their great offensive firepower. They rank 2<sup>nd</sup> in the Big West in batting average (.297), and on-base percentage (.410), while ranking first in runs scored (88), hits (121), and extra-base hits (26).</p>\n<p>UCSB’s slew of hitters starts with sophomore designated hitter Austin Bush. The DH leads the team and is fourth in the Big West in batting average (.429), first in the team and fifth in the Big West in RBI (12), and first on his team in hits (15).</p>\n<p>Another great hitter has been redshirt junior Andrew Calica. The center fielder has been a great leadoff hitter and is currently first on the team in on-base percentage (.557), third in hits (13) and fifth in batting average (.325).</p>\n<p>Other great hitters include redshirt sophomore J.J Muno who is third in hits with 13 and senior third baseman Ryan Clark who is second on the team in hits (14), and third in batting average (.368).</p>\n<p>Leading the pitching staff for the Gauchos on Friday’s opening match-up is junior Shane Bieber. The right-handed pitcher is currently 2-1 on the season but has struggled a bit posting a 5.40 ERA, 28<sup>th</sup> in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, he is helped by a solid bullpen led by left hander Kyle Nelson who has had an amazing start to the season. The sophomore has allowed only nine hits on the season and no earned runs in 16.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Dating back to last season, he has gone 43 1/3 consecutive innings without allowing an earned run, the longest active streak in the NCAA and a UCSB record. He is one of 26 pitchers that currently has a 0.00 ERA.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not lost a home series to a non-conference opponent since 2013 and hopes to keep it that way against Hartford, a team they have never dropped a series against in school history.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is Friday, March 11 against the University of Hartford at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday’s game is at 2 p.m. as well while Sunday’s begins at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

It was the fifth straight game in which the Gauchos never trailed.</p>\n<p>Hitting a three-pointer during the first drive of the game, sophomore guard Gabe Vincent set the tone for his team. The former Big West Freshman of the Year finished with 20 points off 8-12 shooting. Vincent’s defensive presence aided the Gauchos as well, recording two steals including one off Davis’ guard Darius Graham leading to a fast break dunk.</p>\n<p>Quality offensive possessions in the first half were the determining factor for UCSB. The Gauchos went 16-30 from the field, 53.5 percent, in the first period and were able to move the ball around the perimeter and knock down open shots. Head Coach Bob Williams’ first unit was on point tallying 32 of the team’s 42 points in the first half.</p>\n<p>Senior Michael Bryson played a large role in this, going 6-8 from the field and scoring 16 of his team-high 24 points before halftime. The All-Big West guard also hit five three’s in the game, knocking down four of these in the first 20 minutes including back-to-back perimeter shots with 6:42 and 6:00 to go. This was Bryson’s ninth game of the season with 20 or more points.</p>\n<p>The Aggies showed some resilience however, as a miscue from senior T.J. Taylor led to a fast break dunk from guard Lawrence White which brought the score to 26-20. Santa Barbara then responded, taking a 16-3 run to finish out the first half with a 42-23 lead.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos’ scoring attack remained persistent in the second half. With a 20-point advantage, guard Eric Childress drove to the left side of the rack and converted on a nifty reverse layup.</p>\n<p>The junior had a full stat line finishing with nine points, four rebounds, three steals, and a game-high six assists. Santa Barbara is now 9-4 on the year when Childress averages five or more assists.</p>\n<p>Senior John Green was effective off the bench for UCSB as well. The forward recorded his fourth-straight double figure performance with 14 points and five rebounds. Green is currently averaging 15.2 points per game in the team’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos outhustled the Aggies in rebounds, second-chance points, points in the paint, and most significantly bench points with Williams’ second unit winning the battle 27-5. Overall, UCSB shot better from the field finishing with a field goal percentage of 54 percent to Davis’ 42 percent and connected on 11-23 shots from three-point range.</p>\n<p>In hopes of keeping the game within reach for the Aggies, Bryton Lemar and Siler Schneider carried the scoring load for UC Davis. The two finished with 16 points apiece.</p>\n<p>The true freshman Schneider stepped up big for the Aggies, playing 32 minutes and shooting a perfect 4-4 from beyond the arc. The Lansing, Kansas native set the all-time record for the most freshman points scored in team history with 287.</p>\n<p>Following a slow first half, senior Josh Fox finished his final Big West game with 14 points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB will stay alive in March, advancing to the Semifinals of the Big West Tournament and will face No. 1 seeded Hawaii. Tipoff is set for 6:30 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. Friday’s game will also be nationally televised on ESPNU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/","id":332,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[331,330,329],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Looking to Prolong Momentum in Louisville Slugger Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsSouthCarolina-20160227-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsSouthCarolina-20160227-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After back-to-back 4-1 finishes in tournament play over the past two weekends, the UCSB softball team will attempt to continue its steady pace a play at the Louisville Slugger Invitational set to begi...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After yet another great finish last weekend, the UCSB softball team sits at 12-8 overall, and has won nine of its last eleven games.

Santa Barbara will enter the game with a .346 batting average along with a .420 on base percentage. UCSB seems to have the advantage offensively, and it looks to be the same in its following game the next day against Iowa State.</p>\n<p>Iowa State comes into the tournament with an 11-8 overall record, just one win away from UCSB’s win total. However, the two teams differ when it comes to their offensive performance.</p>\n<p>The Cyclones only average.304 at the plate, while their junior outfielder Cathlin Bingham leads the team with a .400 average. In contrast, Gaucho junior outfielder Kristen Clark leads UCSB with a remarkable .486 average.</p>\n<p>Despite the difference in batting, the pitching staffs for both teams are similar, as each boast strong freshman throwers.</p>\n<p>Gaucho freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin will attempt to follow up her first career no hitter last weekend against Charleston Southern. Compared to her time on the mound in high school, Gulvin notices a few changes in the way she currently pitches at the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>“I have to think a lot more about my pitches now,” Gulvin said.</p>\n<p>Although Gulvin carries a 4.13 ERA this year, she continues to prove herself reliable, as she has already collected 37 strikeouts in 42 innings pitched this season.</p>\n<p>Iowa State, however, has two strong freshman pitchers of its own who will test the Gaucho lineup.</p>\n<p>Cyclone freshman pitcher Emma Hylen enters the tournament with an outstanding 1.59 ERA in addition to 30 strikeouts. Cyclone freshman pitcher Savannah Sanders, with 46 strikeouts on the year, could also see the mound this weekend.</p>\n<p>If things go well, the Gauchos should have two wins right off the bat. However, their recent streak could be halted when they face Mississippi State.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs are one of the toughest teams in the tournament, and enter with an incredible 16-3 record. This is largely due to its exceptional pitching staff. Mississippi will be a big test for the strong Gaucho lineup, as its two best pitchers each come into the tournament with ERA’s below 1.00.</p>\n<p>Bulldog pitcher Regan Green currently owns a 0.81 ERA with 53 strikeouts. As if her statistics aren’t impressive enough, she is only a freshman. She is sure to be a threat to any team the Bulldogs go up against, and the Gaucho hitters will have to put all of their focus on getting to her.</p>\n<p>The pressure should lighten a little bit for UCSB as it closes out the tournament with a game against Princeton, who only holds a 3-6 record. The Tigers’ early slump has resulted in meager numbers such as their .249 batting average along with having scored only 32 runs this season.</p>\n<p>Still, Princeton has only played nine games this season, the least amount than any team at the tournament, so the Tigers are still working on putting their pitching and offense together.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s first game in the Louisville Slugger Invitational is scheduled for today against Utah Valley at 4:30 p.m. On Friday, the Gauchos face Iowa State at 9:00 a.m. and Mississippi State at 11:30 a.m. Saturday they will close out the tournament with a game at 10:00 a.m. against Princeton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/","id":62,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[61,60,59],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West Tournament against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team will attempt to continue its historic end to the season in its Quarterfinal game versus UC Davis in the Big West Conference Tournament.

Since then, Santa Barbara has swept teams such as Cal State Fullerton, UC Riverside, and upcoming opponent UC Davis during this tenured win streak.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there were a lot of people that believed when we were 3-5 we’d move back to the upper echelon of the league,” UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Our team has definitely responded well [following this start].”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this essence of hot streaks towards the end of the season is nothing new for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos ended Big West play last year on a five-game winning streak finishing against notable teams such as then first seeded UC Davis, third seeded UC Irvine, and fifth seeded Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Despite ending this season on such a good note, Santa Barbara does face some challenges when matching up against UC Davis. The Aggies host some offensive threats in Neal Monson, Josh Fox, and Darius Graham.</p>\n<p>Although not as effective in the Aggies’ two losses to UCSB during the regular season, Monson has been relatively efficient as of late, averaging 16.5 points in the past two games. In his third year at UCD, Monson is coming off a career night last Saturday against Cal State Northridge in which he registered his third double-double of the season with 21 points and 15 rebounds. These were both team-highs as Monson helped propel the Aggies in their 87-83 triple overtime win on the road.</p>\n<p>The duo of Fox and Graham will also be key for the Aggies against Santa Barbara. Fox, this year’s All-Big West Second Team honoree, has been a reliable scorer for Davis. The senior forward has proven to be dangerous down low scoring 20 or more points on six occasions this year as well as tallying double-figures in scoring in 21 games this season.</p>\n<p>Fox recorded 17 points in his last outing against Santa Barbara, going 8-15 from the floor along with seven rebounds. His ability to maneuver his way into the paint and take quality shots can be attributed to his versatile scoring capabilities as he ranked sixth in the conference with a 51.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Forwards Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe will have their hands full containing both Fox and Monson in the frontcourt as they will attempt to deny the Aggies’ interior attack and hope to limit Davis from scoring easy points in the paint.</p>\n<p>Junior Darius Graham is another central component to Davis’ unit. Awarded this year’s Big West Hustle Player of Year, it is Graham’s tenacious effort at both ends of the court that makes him a vital piece to the Aggies’ success.</p>\n<p>While Graham is only one of three Aggies who averages double figures in points, alongside Fox and junior guard Brynton Lemar, it is his motor and willingness to scrap for loose balls that sets him apart from the rest.</p>\n<p>Aside from Graham’s gritty demeanor on the floor, the third year player has proven to be a threat from beyond the arc. In his last two games against the Gauchos, Graham has hit 6-10 shots from behind the three-point line including a 3-4 performance from downtown in the Aggies’ 72-66 home loss to UCSB on Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Williams will rely on the shooting core of Michael Bryson, Gabe Vincent, and John Green to propel his team to victory.</p>\n<p>The three have been the most consistent for UCSB, averaging more than half of the team’s points— scoring 42.7 of the Gauchos’ 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>After missing six games this season due to a knee injury, three of which were during conference play, the redshirt senior is coming along nicely. Green is shooting an efficient 53 percent from the field during Santa Barbara’s win streak.</p>\n<p>“[John] has had great support around him,” Williams said. “He is a very strong man and drives through the windshield, not the rearview mirror.”</p>\n<p>Green has scored in double figures five times during the team’s current eight-game winning streak, including a team-high 14 points to go along with 10 rebounds on senior night in the Gauchos’ 69-50 win over Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“[We’re playing] with more discipline, but at the same time just having more fun,” Green said. “We’ve been trusting each other more. I’ve always said that it’s not what matters in the beginning of the year it’s what matters in early February and late March. It’s really clicking for us right now during the best time of the year.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff between UCSB and UCD is set for 12 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Sophomore guard Makala Roper led UCSB in scoring with 20 points on 7-18 shooting overall and 3-8 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UC Davis advances to the Semifinals and will face Big West Conference regular season champion UC Riverside this Friday at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos recorded a season-low nine turnovers and matched Davis in field goals made at 24, their 11 extra shot attempts did not benefit them as their 38.7 field goal percentage was surpassed by the Aggies’ 47.1 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>In her postseason debut, redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch led the Aggies’ efficient shooting with a career-high 26 points on 11-16 shooting, tying her career best in field goals made. Her career-high in scoring is the most in a Big West Tournament game by a UC Davis player.</p>\n<p>Bertsch’s career night started early as she scored five points in the Aggies’ 11-4 run to open the game, forcing UCSB to call a timeout. She went on to finish the quarter with nine points while shooting a perfect 4-4 from the field.</p>\n<p>Unable to contain the Aggies’ offense, UCSB’s issues continued on the offensive end as well. Able to only score in spurts, the Gauchos concluded the period down 10-20 after a 4-16 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Despite its shooting woes to begin the game, Santa Barbara improved in the second quarter shooting 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from behind the three-point line, and 100 percent at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>An 8-3 scoring run to begin the second period helped UCSB to trim Davis’ lead to five at 18-23. But the Aggies regained their double figure lead after a made three-pointer by sophomore forward Pele Gianotti. Finishing tied with senior forward Celia Marfone for second in scoring at 15 points apiece, Gianotti went 4-9 shooting the ball and was 2-5 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Trailing by 12, Santa Barbara prevented Davis from extending its lead with an 8-2 run prior to entering halftime. Back-to-back three-pointers by senior guard Dioseline Lopez and Roper in the remaining 2:09 of the second quarter cut the Aggies’ lead to 34-28. Topping off the Gauchos’ run was sophomore forward Taylor Farris with a layup as UCSB entered the half trailing 30-36.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second half, Santa Barbara extended its scoring stretch to a 14-5 run.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ offensive charge in the third quarter was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and freshman guard Coco Miller with a combined total of 13 points on 4-5 shooting.</p>\n<p>With its lead only at three, UC Davis responded with a 7-0 run of its own to recapture another 10-point lead at 46-36 to force a Gauchos’ timeout.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB answered with a 13-4 run to close out the third quarter, capturing its first lead of the game at 49-48 after a made free-throw by Jemerigbe. But the Gauchos’ lead would only last for six seconds as Davis’ sophomore guard Rachel Nagel made a jumpshot to give the Aggies a 50-49 lead before starting the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>While it was a strong ending for UCSB in the game’s final period, shooting 46.7 percent from the field in addition to eight points by Roper, Davis’ scoring arsenal of Bertsch, Gianotti, and Marfone was nearly unguardable.</p>\n<p>The trio scored 19 of the Aggies’ 21 points in the quarter, shot 7-10 from the field, and 2-2 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>A total of seven lead changes occurred in the final 10 minutes of Wednesday’s game. With 1:50 remaining in regulation, a three-pointer by Marfone increased the Aggies’ lead to four to 68-64.</p>\n<p>After calling a timeout, the Gauchos’ top three-pointer shooter in Roper responded with a clutch three of her own to reduce UC Davis’ lead to 68-67.</p>\n<p>Similar to Santa Barbara putting the ball into the hands of its best player, the Aggies did the same in getting the ball to Bertsch in the paint.</p>\n<p>In spite of the play call not succeeding and UCSB gaining possession, UC Davis’ defense managed to hold its ground forcing a turnover with the shot-clock violation to lead itself to victory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/","id":329,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[328,327,326],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Four-Match Home Stretch Kicks Off Versus Portland","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After having last week's road trip cancelled due to the rainy weather, the UCSB women's tennis team will attempt to capitalize on its home court with matches versus Portland at noon and Harvard on Sat...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Now who said it never rains in California?

They have beaten notable teams such as, No. 61 Brown and fellow Big West opponent UC Irvine by a score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams met, back in the 2012-2013 season, UCSB came out on top in a convincing fashion as they made quick work of the Pilots 6-1. It has been three years since then, and there is not a single gaucho that took part in those matches. Unlike Portland who has four returning players hoping to vindicate its losses.</p>\n<p>“They have a stronger team now, they beat Boise State and Irvine, two teams we will have to face in the upcoming month,” said UCSB Head Coach Simon Thibodeau. “We are taking them very seriously, we will have to show up, and we haven’t played a match since Hawaii so it will be challenging, but we are ready”.</p>\n<p>One of those Players is senior Maja Mladenovic. She has won her last three single’s match-ups but has not been able to find the right chemistry with any of her teammates. In doubles competition she is 0-9 this season in at least three different combinations.</p>\n<p>Mladenovic’s fellow senior Lucia Butkovska has been leading her team in the wins category. Her production in the singles category is unmatched by any of her fellow pilots. She is six for two winning her last six singles matches. In doubles play she also leads the team in winning percentage, as she is .500 as a pair winning four out of eight matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB has plenty of options in its arsenal as well. Aside from the dominant duo sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic that currently rank at No. 19 in doubles, the Gauchos have plenty of other stand outs like sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson. As a doubles pair they are undoubtedly the second best combo for Santa Barbara as they have a 10-6 record in doubles winning their last two.</p>\n<p>As individuals they both have been just as proficient. Adler has one of the best individual records on the team with twelve wins and seven losses in single’s competition winning here last three, and six of her last ten. She has demonstrated a presence on the team with her consistency in the the number two position as she is currently 4-1 at the two spot. Atanasson is 9-7 overall in singles and has won her last two matchups.</p>\n<p>“They have good chemistry together. Different styles that compliment each other, friends on and off the court. Lou plays on the baseline, while Amanda likes to play by the net.” Coach Thibodeau explained. “I Would like them to step it up when they play at the two to get tougher wins there. And in singles they have been solid with winning records “</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have just a few more games left before they jump right back into Big West Conference match ups to end the 2016 season and they will need to utilize every game afforded to them to continue to improve and experiment, especially after missing out three games because of rain.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin play Thursday at Noon at the Rec Cen courts against Portland.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/","id":1052,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1051,1050,1049],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Advance, Face No. 4 Seed UC Davis Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A 62-43 first round victory over UC Irvine Tuesday night handed the UCSB women's basketball team its first postseaosn victory since the 2012-13 season.

The Anteaters’ leading scorer with 11 points, Chavez scored six of Irvine’s 10 points in the quarter but could not prevent UCSB from entering halftime with a 25-22 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes and two ties occurred during the third quarter. Tied 34-34, a layup by sophomore guard Makala Roper handed UCSB a 36-34 lead heading into the game’s final period.</p>\n<p>While the Anteaters recorded their best shooting percentage of 38.5 percent in the third quarter, they faltered in the fourth with a 15.8 field goal percentage to end the game.</p>\n<p>As UCI was plagued by its shooting woes, UCSB registered its best shooting performance of the game with a 52.6 shooting percentage in the final quarter. At the helm of the Gauchos’ late surge was Ware with 10 points to help lead UCSB to its 62-43 victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to punch its ticket to Anaheim tonight with a matchup against No. 4 seeded UC Davis at 8:30 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/","id":328,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[327,326,325],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggle Against No. 4 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to 9-7 in conference play after two losses, one at home and one on the road, to No. 4 UCLA.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a month remaining in the regular season, the No. 9 UCSB men’s volleyball team lost twice to no. 4 UCLA last week, the first a 3-1 defeat on the road, then a 3-0 two days later back in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68907\" style=\"width: 207px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68907\" data-attachment-id=\"68907\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-struggle-against-no-4-ucla/mvball_vsucla-20160304-dustinharris-5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68907\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=197%2C296\" alt=\"Jacob Delson swings over the block into the back corner of the court.

The senior credited the quality of the Bruins team for some of his team’s struggles this week.</p>\n<p>“UCLA outplayed us on Friday,” Hardy said. “They served very well and we had a tough time passing making it hard to establish any sort of offense against them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were playing without their top hitter for the majority of each of the matches as redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh, who is averaging a team-high 3.23 kills per set, is fighting back from an ankle injury suffered two weeks ago against USC.</p>\n<p>He only played the fourth set in the 3-1 loss Wednesday and was rested Friday, too, but has been practicing with the team and will be hoping to make his return to the starting lineup in the Gauchos next set of games.</p>\n<p>Marsh’s presence was missed against LA, but redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson did his best to remedy his team’s lack of offensive firepower, tallying team-high 16 kills, his third-straight match with double-digit kills.</p>\n<p>His streak ended Friday, however, when he posted another team-high nine kills.</p>\n<p>Delson, like Hardy, recognized the pressure UCLA put on his team, and pointed to a combination of their offensive struggles and the Bruins’ capitalization on key Gaucho mistakes as the difference in the losses.</p>\n<p>“We struggled putting the ball away against them mainly in transition, and they made smart decisions in regards to making us make the mistakes,” Delson said.</p>\n<p>Following the pair of UCLA games, Delson and co. know they will need to improve in the next couple weeks before matching up against the elite top-four teams in the MPSF playoffs.</p>\n<p>“Going into next week, we need to fix our transition swings and work on keeping our focus when the game is close at the late stages,” Delson said.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a non-conference home match against unranked Concordia on Wednesday, March 9 at Rob Gym at 7pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Up 2-0 in the first with nobody out, the Gauchos failed to score more in the inning, and didn’t score again for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Gauchos lost their lead in the third when UCLA scored three runs on three hits highlighted by infielder Kylee Perez’s double which helped to bring in two runs to give UCLA a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The three hits in the third inning were the only hits in the game for UCLA, but it was enough to edge out the Gauchos for the win. Ashley Ludlow took the loss for the Gauchos, pitching six innings, giving up the three runs while striking out five and walking seven.</p>\n<p>In the game against CSU Bakersfield, the Gauchos had another impressive performance in their 7-4 win over the Roadrunners. The game started out slow for the Gauchos as they were down by one until the fourth inning.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB manage to turn things around offensively as it came back to score a total of six runs. Brucelas was on fire as she sparked the six-run rally with a home run to left field. Freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer finished up with a single to left field, scoring Palomores and Clark for the last two runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>Moreover, UCSB’s pitching staff did a solid job holding down Bakersfield’s lineup. Gulvin pitched through the fifth inning, giving up three runs and striking out three. Santa Barbara’s go-to senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow provided some necessary relief as she pitched the last two innings, giving up one run and striking out four.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to Long Beach next weekend to participate in the Louisville Slugger Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68896\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68896\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/","id":63,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[62,61,60],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Stay Hot And Extend Winning Streak to Four","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB extends its' hot streak to four straight victories after defeating La Verne and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps this past weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68908\" style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68908\" data-attachment-id=\"68908\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/wwaterpolo_vsucsd-20160124-dustinharris-9-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68908\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=384%2C576\" alt=\"Sophie Trabucco wrestles off a defender and tries to pass.

Martin trailed her with five goals and Murphy with four, all against La Verne.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next match is at home against Harvard Saturday, March 19 at Campus Pool at 2:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/","id":5457,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5456,5455,5454],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 5 Seeded Gauchos to Face No. 8 Seeded UCI in First Round of BW Tourney Tuesday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a 2-27, 2-14 conference finish last season, the UCSB women's basketball team will make its return to the Big West Conference Tournament as the No. 5 seed set to face No. 8 seeded UC Irvine this ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Tuesday marks the beginning of the 2015-16 Big West Conference Women’s Basketball Tournament.

The Gauchos last won the conference tournament during their 2012-13 run, in which they made history as the lowest seed (sixth) in Big West history to win the championship.</p>\n<p>Due to splitting its regular season series with Cal State Fullerton, who also finished with a 1-15 conference record, it was by virtue of winning a coin flip that UC Irvine clinched the eighth seed.</p>\n<p>Despite ending the season with a 4-26 overall and 1-15 conference record, the Anteaters may be able to capitalize on their home advantage. But, this home advantage isn’t a guaranteed benefit for UCI after finishing with a 2-11 home record and ending the season on a 10 game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, contributing to its losing slump were two losses to UCSB as the Gauchos achieved a season sweep of the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In two meetings this season, Santa Barbara defeated UCI by a combined point differential of 23.5 points.</p>\n<p>For the most part of this season, losses by a double-figure margin has been the tale for the Anteaters. They’ve managed to lose by a single-figure differential just three times this season and even allowed 126 points in a loss to Sacramento State in December.</p>\n<p>While statistics prove that UCI isn’t a great offensive team, shooting around 34 percent in both overall and conference play, UCSB’s defense has done an exceptional job all season long, especially against UCI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished third in the Big West in points allowed per game with a 63.1 average. Their stout defense improved in conference play as well, finishing second in the rankings allowing 61.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>In spite of allowing a 40.4 field goal percentage in the first meeting, Santa Barbara forced 22 turnovers in the game and outscored the Anteaters 31-13 in points off turnovers to go along with 11 steals. The Gauchos continued their defensive dominance in their second matchup against UCI, limiting the Anteaters to a field goal percentage of 31 percent (18-58 shooting) and 14.3 percent from behind the three-point line. They held UCI to four points in the second and fourth quarters in the same contest.</p>\n<p>Still, just like any team in the country this postseason, UCSB cannot underestimate the Anteaters’ potential to pull off an upset Tuesday night. After making the decision to forgo her senior season, junior forward Mokun Fajemisin will be looking to make an impact in what could be her final game.</p>\n<p>UCI’s leading scorer and rebounder with 9.5 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, Fajemisin also leads the Big West in blocks per game with a 2.0 per game. She is coming off 16 points, nine rebounds, and two blocks in the team’s 76-70 loss to UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will also face the Big West’s top playmaker in senior guard Raelyn Cheung-Sutton. She led the Big West in assists per game with 5.7. Cheung-Sutton remained consistent in conference play, averaging 5.5 helpers per contest. She enters Tuesday after registering a season-high 17 points and tying her career-high total of 12 assists in the loss to UCD.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s backcourt will deal with the task of containing Cheung-Sutton’s vision on the court, an improvement in play by sophomore guard Makala Roper is essential if the Gauchos plan on making a run this postseason.</p>\n<p>After starting in just six games her freshman season and averaging 6.5 ppg, Roper emerged as UCSB’s top scorer in her second year leading the Gauchos in scoring with 11.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>Enhancing her increase in scoring was her range from beyond the arc. During the regular season, Roper ranked fourth in the Big West in three-point percentage at 38.7 percent.</p>\n<p>However, as the Gauchos enter Tuesday 1-3 in their last four games, Roper has struggled during this span as well. She scored 10 points once during this stretch of games along with registering just two points in 19 minutes of play in the team’s final game at Hawaii last Thursday.</p>\n<p>But Roper’s ability to embrace the role placed upon her this season did not go unnoticed as she earned All-Big West Honorable Mention honors on Monday. Senior Jasmine Ware also was named to the Honorable Mention team while freshman guard Coco Miller was selected to the All-Freshman Team.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Conference Tournament is set to tip-off at 6 p.m. this Tuesday, March 8 at the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/","id":327,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[326,325,324],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Achieve Season Sweep of Cal Poly, End with Eight-Game Win Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team extended its winning streak to eight games after defeating Blue-Green rival Cal Poly 69-50 on Saturday.

UCSB also shot 6-12 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did a pretty good job of shot selection and getting ourselves to the rim,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[Cal Poly] had an uncharacteristically bad shooting night from three and that gave us some separation in the game. We didn’t live at the three point line, we had some patience about getting the better shot and that’s when I think we’re a better team.”</p>\n<p>Never trailing at any point in Saturday’s game, it was the Gauchos’ fifth time in the last six games in which they led from start to finish. Santa Barbara has also held its opponents to a 35.8 shooting percentage during its eight-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, forward John Green had arguably his best performance of the season. Leading the Gauchos’ second unit, Green finished his final home game in dramatic fashion tallying in his first double-double of the year with a team-high 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Being able to bring John off the bench has been an unbelievable benefit to this team,” Williams said. “How efficient John has been the last two weeks takes us to a whole other level. People have to guard everywhere on the floor.”</p>\n<p>An uphill battle for last year’s Honorable Mention, Green missed all but four games his first three years under Coach Williams. Battling a series of foot, wrist and knee injuries, the redshirt senior has worked his way back to health and emerged as a major vocal point off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I look at my [injuries] as a learning experience,” Green said. “I just want to be a living testament for people and let him know that if you really love something don’t quit on it.”</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.7 points per game in the last three games, all of which he has led or come second on the team in scoring.</p>\n<p>Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe had a strong senior night performance as well. The two combined for 17 of UCSB’s 20 points in the paint along with six rebounds apiece. After a few stagnant possessions on offense, Beeler beat his man down the lane and connected on a go-ahead dunk from freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak giving the Gauchos a 53-42 lead. This provided UCSB with much needed momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun playing especially when [me and Mitch] are productive,” Beeler said. “We work against each other every day so it’s great to see that work pay off for the both of us.”</p>\n<p>T.J. Taylor and Dajuan Smith played some quality minutes and made an effect around the perimeter. Smith also contributed five points of his own, including a three-point shot from the top of the key with 11:59 to go in the first half.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly made a late push with 5:23 to go off a made three-pointer by guard Taylor Sutlive. The Gauchos quickly responded however, as Green dished a no-look pass to Brewe for a layup to give UCSB a seven-point advantage. From then on, Santa Barbara went 5-6 from the free throw line to finish out the game.</p>\n<p>Gabe Vincent helped seal the deal for the Gauchos. With just 34 seconds left in regulation, the sophomore guard pulled up from the top of the key rising over Minnesota-transfer Josh Martin and drained a shot from beyond the arc. Vincent tied Green’s performance registering 14 points as well.</p>\n<p>Senior David Nwaba led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a team-high 15 points while going 9-13 at the free-throw line along with grabbing nine rebounds. Nwaba was Cal Poly’s primary offensive target the first time these two teams faced, scoring 16 points in the Mustangs’ 76-73 loss at home on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>In addition to their regular season sweep of their Blue-Green rival, the Gauchos clinched the fourth seed in the Big West Conference Tournament. UCSB will face UC Davis in the Quarterfinal round. Tip-off will take place at 12 p.m. on March 10 at the Honda Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/","id":325,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[324,323,322],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":84,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
