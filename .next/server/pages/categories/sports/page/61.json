Those losses, particularly a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Long Beach last Thursday, haven’t been pretty, but they give Pepperdine a sterling resume when combined with wins over top teams like Loyola-Marymount of Chicago and USC.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore David Wieczorek has led the Waves’ attack this season, leveraging his 6-8 frame into 3.81 kills per set on a sparkling .390 attack percentage. Second to Wieczorek is sophomore Michael Wexter, who isn’t far behind with 3.20 kills per set himself, and a team-leading 12 service aces.</p>\n<p>“(Pepperdine) has two main guys on their attack,” UCSB head coach Dan McLaughlin said. “Wieczorek is a big outside hitter, he’s their premiere attacker, and Wexler is the other guy on the outside as well.”</p>\n<p>Wieczorek and Wexter have senior setter Joshua Stewart to thank for setting the majority of their kills up. Stewart leads the team with 230 assists, and he’s in the top 20 nationally with 9.58 assists per set.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the Waves’ success in recent games has been their ability to let opposing teams do their work for them. Both Cal Baptist and USC outkilled Pepperdine – USC did so by a 64-51 margin – but in both games the Waves committed far fewer errors than their opponents. The error differential in both games was enough to give Pepperdine the edge despite their kills deficit.</p>\n<p>Blocks have been similarly important to Pepperdine’s victories this year. The Waves outblocked Cal Baptist and USC by a combined 23-8.5 margin, an advantage that gave them more flexibility to overcome their lack of kills.</p>\n<p>“(Pepperdine) blocks well,” McLaughlin said. “They do that, and they’re really well coached. (Pepperdine head coach Marv Dunphy) is one of the best coaches in the country.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s strengths – errors and blocks – are good news for UCSB. During their losing streak, the Gauchos haven’t been killed on blocks, or committed too many errors. Opponents on the attack, an area in which the Waves have not put up standout numbers, have done most of the damage instead.</p>\n<p>Just last Saturday, for instance, the Gauchos were unable to find an answer for the Hawaii attack. The Rainbow Warriors rode a .357 hitting percentage to a 3-1 win, overriding strong performances from both redshirt senior Jacob Delson (23 kills) and Corey Chavers (18 kills).</p>\n<p>Service is likely to be another crucial area in Wednesday’s matchup. Both teams have struggled with their serves and serve receptions in recent games, and whichever team has that figured out by Wednesday will have a key advantage.</p>\n<p>“We mostly need to serve better,” McLaughlin said. “That hasn’t been great the past four games (…) We’re going to rely on our serve reception guys, because if we pass well we have a good shot at winning.”</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Pepperdine in Malibu on Wednesday night at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It has been a rough year for the UCSB men’s basketball team, and it got even worse on Friday. For the first time since the 2013-14 season, the Gauchos will be without star junior guard Gabe Vincent in their starting lineup for the rest of the season, and possibly beyond, after he suffered a torn ACL in their home loss to CSUF on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss, Santa Barbara still has a game on Saturday and will host UC Davis with a substandard 3-17 overall record and a 1-7 Big West record. For the Aggies, this matchup could not come at a better time after suffering a loss to then league-worst Cal Poly on Thursday, which dropped them to second place in the Big West standings, 13-9 overall, and 5-2 in the conference.</p>\n<p>In case it was not obvious already, the big storyline for UCSB will be how will they replace the production of Vincent, who has been a consistent force since his freshman year. This season, Vincent was the team’s leading scorer and the Big West’s fifth leading scorer averaging 14.8 points per game. Before this injury, the junior had only missed five games in his two-plus years in a Gaucho uniform.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Replacing the former Big West Freshman of the Year and a 2016 Honorable Mention All-Big West recipient will not be an easy task, but it will be a necessary one if the Gauchos hope to make the Big West tournament for the first time after the conference expanded to more than eight teams in the 2007-08 season.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned Cal Poly win not only dropped UC Davis out of first place, but it also put the Gauchos at dead last in the conference. This means that if the Big West tourney were to start today, UCSB would not be in it, thus ending its season despite having defeated the Mustangs for its only conference victory.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Eric Childress is a proven solid point guard, good for scoring 8-10 points on a given night as well as dropping four or more dimes and possibly coming up with a bevy of steals. However, that will not be enough if he cannot have one of the young players step up to help him on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s young athletes range in experience. Sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak played well in Thursday’s loss, scoring 10 points on 4-6 shooting but will need to be tougher on the glass. Sophomore forward J.D. Slajchert a pure hustle player and very important asset, but he will need to be more consistent with his mid-range jumper in order to help the Gauchos’ 346th-ranked field percentage in the country.</p>\n<p>Freshman guards Christian Terrell, Max Heidegger and Clifton Powell Jr. have all shown tremendous promise, but that potential needs to show up now if the Gauchos want to win ball games.</p>\n<p>In reality, this season has always been about that. Vincent and Childress were not going to be able to carry this team to the postseason themselves; they need the young players to help them. With the losses of Ami Lakoju, Jalen Canty, Jarriesse Blackmon and now Vincent, that truth become all the more real.</p>\n<p>Facing UC Davis will be no easy task, as the Aggies crushed UCSB at Davis 73-47 earlier this year. Not to mention, the Aggies also have one of the best new players in the Big West this year in Chima Moneke, who ranks first in rebounds and third in scoring in the conference with 8.7 RPG and 16.0 PPG.</p>\n<p>Even with that, Saturday’s match will tell one thing: how the Gauchos will respond to this type of adversity. Losing anyone to injury is hard, and it only gets harder when that person is as efficient as Vincent, but the season goes on. Santa Barbara has faced some tough setbacks all year, quite possibly more than any other team in this conference, but a berth in the Big West tourney would be a great accomplishment given all it has suffered through.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces UC Davis at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 4, at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Visiting the Thunderdome on a three-game winning streak, UC Davis sits atop the Big West with the league’s best overall and conference record of 16-6, 7-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB is coming off its best defensive performance of the season, in which it held Cal State Fullerton to a season-low 37 points. Most notably, the Gauchos’ bench was pivotal in their 20-point victory, outscoring the Titans 30-2 in bench points.</p>\n<p>Responsible for a tied game-high 14 of those bench points was redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Over the span of the Gauchos’ last five games, Toler has undoubtedly been the team’s flare off the bench on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court, especially during the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>During Big West play, Toler is second on the team in scoring with an 11.5 points per game average. She has tallied double-figures in five consecutive games and is shooting 54 percent over the span of games.</p>\n<p>Her ability to penetrate the paint and find open shooters continues to be beneficial as well as she is tied with her backcourt partner senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe for third in the Big West with a 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Often undersized when guarding in the backcourt, it is Toler’s quick hands and feet that have allowed her to be one of the team’s best on-ball defenders.</p>\n<p>Toler’s 1.9 steals per game average during conference play ranks second in the Big West. In 17 of UCSB’s 21 games this season, Toler has had at least one steal. As of recently, she has been a consistent bother on defense with three steals in three of the team’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Also providing consistency within the Gauchos’ starting lineup are both redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Alongside Toler, Edelman and Porter are the team’s other two double figure scorers during conference play. Porter averages a team leading 13 PPG, while Edelman is at 10.8, respectively. Edelman leads the Big West in field goal percentage at 57.4 percent.</p>\n<p>While UCSB will definitely need an improved first half start, opposite of its 17 points scored in its previous game, its on-ball pressure both inside the paint and along the perimeter will be most important in facing UC Davis.</p>\n<p>UC Davis plays at a patient, yet efficient pace which is most evident by their offense. Most importantly, the Aggies are structured with each possession as they are second in the conference with the least amount of turnovers per game at a 14.0 average.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, their care with the ball translates to their scoring as they lead the Big West with 70.6 PPG. The focal point to UC Davis’ offensive success is redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch.</p>\n<p>An All-Big West Second team and Big West All-Freshman team selection last season after being the program’s first freshman to lead the team in scoring since 1979-80 at 13.9 PPG, Bertsch is one of the league’s most productive frontcourt players.</p>\n<p>She ranks second in PPG and fourth in field goal percentage in the Big West with averages of 16.1 and 51.5, respectively. Bertsch owns a team-leading six 20-point games this season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ frontcourt star is a key factor in their conference leading 44.1 field goal percentage. Yet, also contributing is their 35.8 three-point percentage which also leads the Big West as well.</p>\n<p>Providing UC Davis with a perimeter threat is junior forward Pele Gianotti. She averages 10.3 PPG and is one of the Aggies’ most lethal shooters, making 37.6 percent of her three-pointers, ranking eighth in the conference.</p>\n<p>Despite Davis’ explosive offense, UCSB has the ability to keep up with the pace of the Aggies as the Gauchos are right behind them in both field goal percentage and three-point percentage at 41.3 and 35.1, respectively.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip-off this Saturday, Feb. 4 at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75462\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75462\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/","id":447,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[446,445,444],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hopes To Bounce Back at Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.27_StephenManga_MensVB-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.27_StephenManga_MensVB-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Looking to rebound from two straight 3-0 losses to UCLA, the UCSB men’s volleyball team could probably use a change of scenery.

The senior setter leads the team in assists with 265 and is 16<sup>th</sup> in the nation with 9.46 assists per set, but it’s been sophomore Joe Worsley who’s handled the bulk of the assists in the past two games. That reshuffle is likely due to Hawaii head coach Charlie Wade’s lineup tinkering against Grand View, so it’s unclear if Worsley will continue as the primary setter even in league play.</p>\n<p>That reshuffle is likely due to Hawaii head coach Charlie Wade’s lineup tinkering against Grand View, so it’s unclear if Worsley will continue as the primary setter even in league play.</p>\n<p>There’s more to Hawaii’s success this season than just attack prowess, however. The Rainbow Warriors are among the best in the NCAA in both blocks and digs, with a sixth-best 2.53 block per set rate, and a ninth-best 8.89 dig rate. Success in those two areas has allowed Hawaii to hold its opponents to a microscopic .216 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are going to have to work hard to get past that defense if they want to rebound from last week’s setbacks and really enjoy their trip to beautiful Honolulu. As of late, however, UCSB has struggled with its hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>While still ranked seventh in that category, the Gauchos hit at a .235 rate in their two games against UCLA. Against a team with a defense like the Rainbow Warriors’ UCSB is going to have to hit better than that to win.</p>\n<p>Key to that effort will be finding another player to help relieve some of Jacob Delson’s offensive burden. Against UCLA, Delson was the only Gaucho to record double-digit kills in either game. In Honolulu, UCSB will need players like Corey Chavers and Keenan Sanders to step up and give the Gaucho attack a more balanced approach.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Hawaii at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu on Friday night at 9:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75489\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75489\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/","id":5009,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5008,5007,5006],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face No. 24 UCLA at Final Stop on Three-Game Road Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos will end their road trip when they take on the No. 24 ranked Bruins.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Gauchos will be playing their first game in California as they are coming back from ITA Kickoff Weekend in Texas which saw UCSB come away with losses in both of the games they played.

However, the Bruins dropped the last game of singles play and Georgia Tech was able to clinch the victory in singles play as well as the entire meet.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss, the UCLA Bruins have a talented team that is deserving of their #24 ranking. At the head of the Bruin tennis squad is freshman Ena Shibahara, who is ranked #4 in the country in singles play. In doubles, the UCLA tandem of Jada Heart and Ena Shibahara is ranked #9, a ranking that becomes considerably more impressive due to the fact that both are freshman.</p>\n<p>Jada Heart was also named the Pac-12 player of the week for her performance against Kentucky where she clinched the doubles point against the #1 ranked duo in the country and later clinched the overall victory in singles play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are looking to respond to UCLA’s roster with their own talented roster. In doubles play, Santa Barbara tandem Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic have won two out of the three doubles matches they have played so far this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to Stojic and Dubavets, the Gauchos also have the talented pair of Melissa Baker and Stephanie Yamada is coming off of their first win in doubles play as their victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks last weekend ended their losing streak of two games. In singles play, the Gauchos are looking to rebound after dropping five out of the six sets to the Gamecocks.</p>\n<p>Playing against the #24 Bruins will be yet another test for the Gauchos as they are in the midst of an extremely tough schedule. In their first 3 games of the season the UCSB Gauchos have lost every game and, although they are still remaining competitive in their meets, the consecutive losses have made for a difficult start to the season. The Gauchos will finally be able to return home after this upcoming game, a change that could be good for the Gauchos as their road trip comes to a close.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will play the UCLA Bruins on Friday, February 3rd at 1:30 PM PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

month. Simpson’s 59.62 mark from two weeks ago should definitely be fast enough to qualify for the final this weekend based on last year’s Jacksons/NB results, where her time would’ve placed sixth. As for Moss, any mark close to her season best of 11.60m will have a great chance of finishing first, as last year’s meet winner only managed 10.70m.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for Moss, any mark close to her season best of 11.60m will have a great chance of finishing first, as last year’s meet winner only managed 10.70m.</p>\n<p>The women long jumpers enter the meet with lofty ambitions this year after managing three finishers in the top eight at the Bronco Invite. The trio of Tori Usgaard (5–5.58m), Josephine Grabber (6–5.48m), and Moss (8—5.43m) has the potential to become one of the strongest jumping teams in the Big West as the season goes on.</p>\n<p>Although Moss will be the only one of the three competing in the long jump at Boise for the Jacksons meet, she will be accompanied in the event by Aine McNulty, freshman and Cassidy Peng, sophomore, who are both capable of jumping well over 5m as well.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will realistically be able to pick up at least two or three medals in the jumping events alone, much thanks to Moss’s prowess, but her teammates will like their chances to sneak onto the podium, too, as last year’s winner hit 5.72m, with no other jumper above 5.21m.</p>\n<p>In the Weight Throw, senior Valerie Nestor and junior Kayla Thayer will hope to improve upon the throwing team’s showing at the Bronco Invite, when Thayer finished 15th with a 13.95 best mark. If the quality of the J/NB invite is the same as last year, the same mark would’ve finished 15th, so the thrower will be keen to break the 14m mark for a chance to climb up a bit in the final results.</p>\n<p>Sprinters Alana Epps and Brianna Cheeks will be the only Gauchos in the six-heat 60m Dash event; in their last meet, the two sophomores faced off in prelims, with Epps edging her teammate by .01 seconds with a time of 8.10s. Although the two aren’t in the same heat, running even a hundredth of a second faster each would give the pair a great chance at making the final in Boise this weekend, with 8.10s the cutoff for the final last year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have promising chances to come home from Idaho with plenty of hardware from the Jacksons/NB Invitational, with depth in most of the women’s events that could see UCSB pose a major threat up and down the meet sheet at Boise St.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/gauchos-headed-to-boise-for-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/gauchos-headed-to-boise-for-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/gauchos-headed-to-boise-for-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/gauchos-headed-to-boise-for-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/gauchos-headed-to-boise-for-invitational/","id":4837,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[4836,4835,4834],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Key Matchup: Tom Brady vs. Matt Ryan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/compare.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/compare.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Two of this season's top quarterbacks are set to face each other in Super Bowl LI this Sunday.

A major key to his team’s success will reside on the backfield’s ability to run after catch on short plays.</p>\n<p>Also, considering he’s missing the best tight-end in the league, Gronkowski, Brady has proven time and time again that he’ll get the job done no matter what. He’s looked as stellar as ever throughout the postseason thus far, and with questions of retirement in the air, one thing is for sure: Brady’s going out with a bang.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Ryan</strong></p>\n<p>Matt Ryan has become the franchise quarterback that Falcons fans have been searching for since Mike Vick. Statistically speaking, Ryan has been ranked top three in almost every QB category this season and has been prepping his game all season long.</p>\n<p>Ryan led the Falcons to break the franchise scoring record during the season. Alongside a very talented backfield, Ryan has found much success on screen plays and the safety valve options his running backs offer, not to mention a receiving corps that has proven to be one of the most potent in the league. With a 117.1 passer rating, on paper, he’s been more productive than his opponent counterpart.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse for future defensive matchups, Ryan is merely 31 years old and is hitting his peak at the perfect time. With two great passing QBs waiting to start in this upcoming Super Bowl, viewers are sure to be in for quite the show.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/key-matchup-tom-brady-vs-matt-ryan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/key-matchup-tom-brady-vs-matt-ryan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/key-matchup-tom-brady-vs-matt-ryan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/key-matchup-tom-brady-vs-matt-ryan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/key-matchup-tom-brady-vs-matt-ryan/","id":3345,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3344,3343,3342],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl LI Key Matchups: Offense, Defense, Special Teams Pt. 2","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sportsball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sportsball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Daily Nexus Sports staff was assigned different key matchups that could have a profound impact on the outcome of Sunday's Super Bowl game.

A primetime matchup that often gets overlooked is set to happen in the trenches themselves, primarily revolving around the Falcons defensive line vs. the Patriots offensive line.</p>\n<p>Although not much credit is given regarding their offensive line, the Patriots have been much improved this season after an atrocious 2015-16 season. Much of this credit should be given to offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who has really turned this group around. Left tackle Nate Solder holds the fort down for QB Tom Brady, while Marcus Cannon solidifies the run game on the right side.

These averages are the outcome of a sturdy offensive line that is healthy. For any quarterback, being provided time in the pocket is key, but it becomes even more advantageous for a quarterback such as Brady, who they protected well with the fifth best ranking in sacks allowed at 24.</p>\n<p>Opposite the line of scrimmage is the Atlanta Falcons, who are an elusive and strong front. This is despite the fact that they rank sixth and seventh in rush and pass defense, respectively, during the playoffs; the Falcons are giving up 5.3 yards per rush to opposing teams, but only 6.8 yards per pass.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in an average of 20.5 points allowed per game; however, Vic Beasley Jr., Jonathan Babineaux, Tyson Jackson, Dwight Freeney and Co. are going to try and limit Brady and the Patriots. They have achieved their average the past two games, but the Patriots’ offense is explosive, and this D-Line may have to battle in a game that could possibly lead to a shootout.</p>\n<p>But don’t count the Falcons out just yet. All eyes will be on Beasley Jr. after he ended the season with a league-leading 15.5 sacks.</p>\n<p>Super Bowl 51 is set to be a great one, with anticipation of a high scoring, offensively charged game that could get out of hand on the scoreboard. The matchup seems sized up to be a battle in the trenches, and it could be a result of which line is willing to push a little harder to obtain the coveted Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Defense by Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>An old mantra of the NFL has been that “defense wins championships.” That hypothesis can both be supported in this year’s Super Bowl by the Patriots, who concluded the regular season with 5,223 yards allowed, the eighth fewest in the league.</p>\n<p>Yet it can be somewhat rejected, as the team graded out as subpar, finishing 16th in Football Outsiders’ defensive DVOA, known as Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, is a stat that measures the overall efficiency of the defense compared to league average.</p>\n<p>Atlanta is no greater on defense either, finishing the regular season ranked 27th in defensive DVOA, with the 25th defense according to total yards allowed (5,939). The unit has been playing well of late though, giving up 21 and 20 points in their first two playoff games against the Seahawks and Packers, respectively, both of which are teams with high offensive ceilings.</p>\n<p>Vic Beasley Jr. was a monster for the team all year, leading the league with 15.5 sacks. Although he’s yet to notch one in the playoffs thus far, the Falcons have sacked the quarterback five times in the past two games, suggesting Tom Brady will be under pressure all evening.</p>\n<p>In Brady’s two Super Bowl losses, a vicious opposing pass rush has been a common element and figures to be an essential factor in determining Sunday’s outcome.</p>\n<p>Atlanta has shown a penchant for creating chaos this postseason, amassing three interceptions, a forced fumble and a safety. New England has created five turnovers itself during the 2017 playoffs and will need to turn Matt Ryan over once or twice to have a shot at stopping this high-powered Falcons offense.</p>\n<p>The main playmakers in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, wide receiver Julio Jones, quarterback Matt Ryan and the backfield duo of Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman should be eager for a Patriots matchup that could work to their advantage.</p>\n<p>While New England allowed more than 20 points in only three games this regular season, it ranks 20th in defensive DVOA versus both number one receivers and running backs.</p>\n<p>But New England has put together a cohesive group on the defensive side of the ball, though the Patriots are bereft of the defensive superstars that have been a key component in each of Bill Belichick’s Super Bowl winning runs.</p>\n<p>No longer are the Pats depending on impact players such as Chandler Jones and Darrelle Revis from two years ago, who have been replaced by Chris Long and Logan Ryan, and it’s yet to be seen if this group can match up with a team as talented as the Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>I’ll take Brady, though, who has only thrown two interceptions on the year and seems pretty intent on sticking it to Roger Goodell and co.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Backfield by Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>Although it will be only the Falcons’ second ever Super Bowl appearance compared to the Patriots’ record-high 10th, Sunday’s matchup could be thrilling, especially when looking at the Falcons backfield going against the Patriots defense.</p>\n<p>Ranked No. 3 in the NFL when defending against the run, opposing teams only complete 88.6 rushing yards per game on average, making evident the cohesiveness and ability of the Pats’ defensive line. New England has only allowed five rushing touchdowns in 18 games this season, including playoffs, while not allowing a single running back to rush for over 100 yards in a single game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the field, the Atlanta Falcons backfield is No. 4 in the league, averaging 4.6 yards per run. They have managed to score 20 touchdowns off running plays during the regular season but will be challenged by the Patriots’ strong rushing defense.</p>\n<p>Propelling the Falcons’ offense are two particularly strong running backs in Tevin Coleman and Devonta Freeman. Twenty-three-year-old Coleman totaled 520 rushing yards in the regular season, scoring eight rushing touchdowns, averaging 4.4 yards per run and has not slowed his roll since season has ended. Coleman is also a huge threat out of the backfield as receiver where he totaled 421 yards on 31 receptions and added three more touchdowns.</p>\n<p>On 28 total touches this postseason, the Indiana alum has registered 143 total yards (86 yards rushing, 57 receiving) and two touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Teammate Freeman made it past the 1,000-yard mark for the second straight season rushing for a career-high 1,079 yards this year while, adding 11 rushing touchdowns. Like Coleman, Freeman also does a great job as a receiver as he totaled 54 receptions in the regular season for 462 yards and two touchdowns. In two games this season, Freeman rushed for over 100 yards and in both, the Falcons won by an average margin of 20.5 points. In his two postseason games, Freeman has totaled 207 total yards and two touchdowns on 36 touches.</p>\n<p>With experience as well as energy on their side, the Patriots present a strong front that could help lead the team to victory if their defensive ends can cover the outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Offense vs. Falcons Offense by Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>Super Bowl LI has potential to be an offensive clash for the ages, as the Falcons and Patriots, arguably the two best offenses in the NFL, flex their muscles on the biggest stage. Beyond the most notable matchup between perennial champion Tom Brady and veteran Matt Ryan — who has taken his game to a whole new level this season — throwing for a career high 38 TDs, both teams boast a countless number of threats that could make for a memorable game.</p>\n<p>If the defenses show up on their top game as expected, though, the running game will be key in deciding which team controls the tempo. Patriots RB LeGarrette Blount has been having a Super Bowl-worthy season, with 18 regular season TDs, adding one more in his team’s AFC Championship victory over the Steelers.</p>\n<p>His counterpart is no slouch either, as Falcons RB Devonta Freeman enters the title bout with 11 rushing TDs in the regular season while eclipsing 1,000 yards for the second straight season.<br>\nAtlanta heads into the big game with a slight edge in nearly every offensive category, with 295.3 yards in the air per game compared to New England’s 269.3 and 38 passing scores to 32.</p>\n<p>On the ground, the Falcons keep their advantage from their three-pronged running game with 120.5 yards per game and 20 TDs to the Patriots’ 117.0 YPG and 19 TDs.</p>\n<p>The Patriots’ biggest strength lies in their two main receiving targets for Brady, Julian Edelman and Martellus Bennett, who have combined for 1,800 receiving yards and 10 TDs this year, while the former was targeted 158 times, more than twice any other teammate. Matt Ryan’s number one target, Julio Jones, has had years to develop a relationship with his quarterback and the benefits this season were remarkable; Jones gathered over 1,400 receiving yards and seven TDs, averaging just over 100 YPG.</p>\n<p>Both teams have playmakers at every key offensive position and both offensive lines give the quarterbacks enough time to control the game, so the spotlight will obviously be on the two star QBs; that being said, it’ll be up to one of the skill players to come up with a game-winning play in the end.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>New England ended the regular season with 1,872 total rushing yards, 117 rushing yards per game and 19 rushing touchdowns. Each total had a top finish in the league at seventh in total rushing yards, seventh in rushing yards per game and fifth in rushing touchdowns in the league.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Patriots’ backfield has been able to keep up their regular season success in the postseason as they have averaged 77.5 rushing yards per game and have two touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Blount led the league in rushing touchdowns with 18 this year and has one touchdown in the postseason. Blount has served as the go-to back for the Patriots’ offense, but Lewis and White have been able to positively affect the offense with their own unique skill sets.</p>\n<p>Lewis, the smaller scat back, has only gotten better since coming off of an ACL injury earlier in the year and is a big play threat due to his mix of speed, agility, and elusiveness.</p>\n<p>While Blount and Lewis will most likely see a large share of touches, White has proven he can come up clutch in situations when given the chance as well.</p>\n<p>Atlanta’s defense has been below average against the run this year as it allowed 15 rushing touchdowns and 104.5 rushing yards per game, making them 19th in touchdowns allowed and 17th in rushing yards per game. Despite their regular season trouble, the Falcons base nickel defense has not allowed a rushing touchdown this postseason.</p>\n<p>The Falcons’ young defense is looking to continue their success as players like Keanu Neal, Vic Beasley Jr. and Deion Jones are defensive playmakers who can put a dent into the success of the Patriots’ trio of backs. Their defense should be well prepared to try and stop the versatile Patriots backfield.</p>\n<p>However, I feel the Patriots’ amount of offensive weapons in both the pass and rush game will be too much for the Falcons to handle, leaving the opportunity for the New England backfield to shine. I predict the final score will be 31-28, with the Patriots hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats WRs vs. Falcons Secondary by Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>While they might not compare to Atlanta’s stellar duo of Julio Jones and Mohammad Sanu, the New England Patriots’ core of wide receivers can mean the difference in another championship banner or empty-handed defeat approaching this year’s much anticipated Super Bowl matchup.</p>\n<p>Operating under Offensive Coordinator Josh McDaniel and his slot-schemed offense, the Pats’ spread of receivers Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan and Danny Amendola will be a primary concern for a strong and ball-hawking Falcons’ secondary.</p>\n<p>Eight-year veteran and Super Bowl XLIX hero Julian Edelman is the first impact player Head Coach Dan Quinn and his Falcons must attend to. Epitomized for the big moment and for being Tom Brady’s go-to guy in crunch time, Edelman has been known for thriving under pressure and making big plays when it matters.</p>\n<p>His go-ahead grab that put the Patriots up against the Seahawks in the final minute of Super Bowl XLIX is a prime example as well as his eight receptions for 118 yards and one touchdown in the Patriots 36-17 AFC Championship win over the Steelers this postseason.</p>\n<p>Edelman had a solid regular season as well with 98 receptions, and a career-high 1,109 receiving yards as well as hauling in three touchdowns. The eighth-year receiver is also coming off his best year in the postseason, averaging eight catches and 127 yards per game in his games versus the Texans and Steelers.</p>\n<p>Monmouth product Chris Hogan is also another liability on offense for the Falcons. Coming off the game of his career, Hogan has proven to be a target that can catch the deep ball, recording 180 yards and two touchdowns in New England’s match against the Steelers.</p>\n<p>In terms of Atlanta’s defense, the Falcons’ pool of cornerbacks will match up well and pose a big test on New England’s athletic receivers. Corners Robert Alford, Jalen Collins and Brian Poole play an integral part in Atlanta’s coverage scheme. They are able to make the sure tackle and jam up their opponent combining for 28 total tackles and five pass deflections this postseason.</p>\n<p>Safeties Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen serve as the stronghold for the Falcons’ secondary. Neal’s 17 postseason tackles and Allen’s two interceptions lead the team.<br>\nOverall, this matchup between the Patriots’ receivers and Falcons serves as an enticing pair that everyone should keep their eyes on.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Secondary vs. Falcons WRs by Tommy Pardini</strong></p>\n<p>An integral part of the high-powered Atlanta Falcons offense is their solid receiving core led by All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, who is consistently in the conversation for the top wide receiver in the NFL.</p>\n<p>The Falcons’ passing attack through Jones has been killing teams all year long. Just ask the Green Bay Packers, who surrendered 180 receiving yards and two touchdowns to the 6’3” 220-pound beast in the NFC title game.</p>\n<p>Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan loves to move players around in different spots on the field. For example, Jones or receiver Taylor Gabriel will frequently line up out wide by either sideline or in the slot depending on the play.</p>\n<p>This means the defensive unit on the other side of the ball needs to be versatile and intelligent, traits that many New England Patriot players possess.</p>\n<p>The secondary for the Patriots is comprised of Super Bowl veterans like cornerback Malcolm Butler and safeties Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung, who have both played in two Super Bowls. McCourty converted from cornerback to safety a few years back, which is evident with his versatile ability to line up with receivers when need be.</p>\n<p>The New England coaching staff seems to always put their players in positions to succeed. Under Head Coach Bill Belichick, while playing in the postseason, the Patriots have only allowed one playoff touchdown to any first-team All-Pro receiver standing 6 feet or taller (Julio Jones), with the average stat line consisting of about five catches and 62 receiving yards as reported on NESN.com. This includes 19 players’ playoff games from only their All-Pro caliber seasons.</p>\n<p>Over this entire year, Julio Jones is averaging 3.2 yards per route run, which is tops in the NFL by nearly half a yard per ProFootballFocus.com. The versatile Patriots’ secondary will undoubtedly have their hands full. Atlanta’s receiving unit has been tough to handle this season because they come at you in so many ways.</p>\n<p>This fascinating matchup could be a big deciding factor in Super Bowl LI. A great performance from Jones and the rest of the Falcons receivers could give Atlanta their first ever Lombardi Trophy. The reverse would give Brady and Belichick the most Super Bowl victories by a quarterback-coach duo in NFL history.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<p><strong>Pats Special Teams vs. Falcons Special Teams by Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>Heading into this Sunday’s Super Bowl, there’s been a lot of debate about Bill Belichick versus Matt Ryan and Tom Brady versus Vic Beasley Jr. Yet there hasn’t been a whole lot of debate about special teams.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<p>That’s understandable; special teams often receive sort of a “redheaded stepchild” treatment when it comes to sports arguments. Just because it’s understandable, however, doesn’t make that lack of debate any less of a shame.</p>\n<p>Most years, New England’s high ranking would lean heavily on their kicker, four-time Pro Bowler Stephen Gostkowski.</p>\n<p>The 11-year veteran has succeeded for most of his career but experienced early-season struggles during the regular season. He ended with three missed extra points and four missed field goals to accumulate an 84.4 field goal percentage — the lowest in his career since 2012 — making Gostkowski less reliable than usual.</p>\n<p>Matt Bryant, on the other hand, has been nothing but reliable for the Falcons this year. Bryant had the best season of his 15-season career, going 34-37 on field goals and 56-57 on extra points. Simply put, if this game comes down to kicking, Atlanta’s got the edge.</p>\n<p>Kick coverage, on the other hand, is an easy decision.</p>\n<p>The Falcons are one of the worst teams in the league in both kickoff and punt coverage, while the Patriots — led by Matthew Slater and Nate Ebner — keep returners pretty much silent.</p>\n<p>New England’s strong kick coverage will be a crucial key in hindering the high-octane Atlanta offense, while the Falcons might have some trouble keeping the Patriots from enjoying consistently good field position.</p>\n<p>In the end, the pivotal point between these two special teams is the return game. New England has struggled to find consistency with its returners and has been plagued by fumbles.</p>\n<p>Dion Lewis remains a threat in the Patriots’ return game in which he showcased his ability with a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the Patriots Divisional Round win over the Houston Texans.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Eric Weems holds things down for the Falcons and provides them with an ideal arrangement. Currently, in his 10th year, the veteran return specialist is sixth in the league in punt return average amongst qualified players and was the team’s leading returner during the regular season with 391 yards on 17 returns.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Falcons seem to have the special teams advantage, thanks to Stephen Gostkowski’s inconsistency and Eric Weems’s consistency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A

I mean, it wouldn’t be the Patriots as we know them without the most unexpected rookies, forgotten vets and other brushed-off players emerging year after year.</p>\n<p>While there’s no pinpointing Belichick’s “system,” his leadership and oftentimes disliked quirkiness has set him apart from the rest of the league.</p>\n<p>New England has become the league’s juggernaut that can never be counted out. The dynasty’s foundation has always been a storyline with tones of a franchise rebuilt from the ground up.</p>\n<p>This Sunday, their Super Bowl 51 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons is no different; the Patriots make their league-record ninth Super Bowl appearance in hopes of winning their fifth Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p>Both Belichick and Brady are currently in their 17th season with the Patriots organization. The opportunity to further cement themselves as the greatest to ever grace the sideline and field in NFL history is in full effect this Sunday.</p>\n<p>Belichick and Brady are the only coach and player ever to each achieve seven Super Bowl appearances. Thus far, they have been members of all four of the franchise’s Super Bowl-winning teams.</p>\n<p>The all-time leader in postseason wins by a quarterback with 24, Brady has the opportunity to become the first quarterback in NFL history to win five Super Bowls.</p>\n<p>While many are anticipating “Tom’s Revenge” after he endured a four-game suspension and witnessing Commissioner Roger Goodell hand Brady the Lombardi Trophy as an apology for the temporary ban, there seem to be more personal things at stake.</p>\n<p>For a quarterback who believes he could play until the age of 45, Brady has bigger concerns than Commissioner Goodell.</p>\n<p>Despite once again being in the MVP conversation after posting regular season numbers of 3,554 passing yards, 28 passing touchdowns, an 112.2 passer rating and just two interceptions, I think it’s safe to say Brady is ready to provide the final verdict of himself as the greatest QB ever.</p>\n<p>I’m sure you’re thinking, “Well, hasn’t he already established that?” However, it’s as if we’ve become so accustomed to Brady’s greatness that admiration for his consistency has gradually diminished.</p>\n<p>Yes, he is still elite. His legacy is further enhanced as a four-time Super Bowl champion and current two-time NFL MVP. Even still, these accomplishments have not been enough for those who doubt Brady’s placement amongst the best.</p>\n<p>From “Spygate” to “Deflategate” or even the argument that he has only attained his greatness because of Belichick’s coaching system, Brady still has something to prove.</p>\n<p>Whether or not a win on Sunday will curtail any of the criticisms Brady receives is unpredictable, but it’s certain that it will take more than Brady if a shootout takes place against the leader of the NFL’s top scoring offense in the Falcons’ quarterback Matt Ryan.</p>\n<p>Although the team’s player-coach duo has received the majority of the praise for its success year after year, the most integral role heading into Super Bowl LI is the Patriots’ receiving core.</p>\n<p>Brady’s ability to produce despite the lack of a true No. 1 receiver over the years is constantly glorified. Aside from Randy Moss’s stint with the Patriots from 2007-2009 and a return in 2010, New England has had few noteworthy receivers but has still managed to be one of the league’s top offenses each season.</p>\n<p>Via <em>sportingcharts.com</em>, since 2009 the New England Patriots have ranked in the top 10 of Team Yards After Catch (YAC) totals in six of the last eight seasons, including back-to-back No. 1 finishes in 2011 and 2012.</p>\n<p>This season, the Patriots ended the regular season third with a YAC total of 2,334, just 48 yards shorter than Atlanta’s second-place finish.</p>\n<p>Despite having just one 1,000 yard receiver in Julian Edelman, whose current total of 84 career postseason receptions is nine away from No. 2 all-time per <em>espn.com</em>, the Patriots’ receiving core was still a nightmare matchup for a majority of teams this season.</p>\n<p>While the season-ending injury to tight end Rob Gronkowski was detrimental to its offense, New England’s bevy of receiving options in Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell, Danny Amendola, Martellus Bennett and even running back James White has exposed defenses.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Falcons, there’s no one Patriot receiver to key in on, as each is versatile enough to line up in the slot or wide out near the sideline. Hogan, for example, is coming off a career performance after a record-setting 180 receiving yards on nine catches for two touchdowns in the team’s blowout AFC title win over Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>As long as the Pats can protect Brady and give him the ample amount of time in the pocket, it could be a field day for New England’s receivers. They will be facing an Atlanta defense that didn’t fare well against the pass during the regular season, allowing the fifth-most passing yards per game and passing touchdowns at a 266.7 average and a total of 31, which was five less than the league-high allowance of 36.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, I initially didn’t approach this piece with the belief that the Patriots would win this Sunday. Although my heart still resides with the underdog Atlanta, I am left somewhat undecided because of the unpredictability the tandem of Brady and Belichick presents.</p>\n<p>Whether it be Atlanta winning its first Super Bowl in franchise history or New England and Brady earning its fifth, history will be made to the benefit of not just football, but the culture of sports.</p>\n<p><strong>Atlanta Falcons by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Rooting for the underdog is definitely not new to a whole lot of people, especially in sports. This year is no different, as countless fans and non-fans alike will be rooting for the underdog Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>Newcomers to the biggest stage the game has to offer — considering their last, and only, Super Bowl appearance was in 1999 —the Falcons will certainly need to accommodate to the spotlight quickly if they have any shot of beating the league’s greatest dynasty, the New England Patriots.</p>\n<p>Looking back to the beginning of the season, no one could have possibly predicted that this team from the NFC South would be representing its respective side of the conference come February. ESPN’s Vaughn McClure had them missing the playoffs with a 7-9 overall record, while Heath Evans and Elliott Harrison of the NFL Network projected the Falcons to finish the regular season with only five wins.</p>\n<p>Having already proven the experts wrong just by making it to the Super Bowl, the Falcons want to take the ultimate step and win the whole thing.</p>\n<p>To go one step even further, who could have predicted that 10 years after the scandal of the once promising Michael Vick hurt the city of Atlanta — not to mention the cowardly departure of former Head Coach Bobby Petrino — that the Falcons would be one win away from hoisting the Lombardi trophy.</p>\n<p>Despite great moves by team owner Arthur Blank in the hiring of coaches and GMs throughout the last few years, no decision was a better one than the drafting of Matt Ryan. In a lot of ways, Ryan and Atlanta are very deserving of each other, especially in a game of this magnitude, as they both know the feeling of being the underdog.</p>\n<p>Drafted to replace Vick two years after Vick’s scandal, Ryan was expected to have great success right away for Atlanta. Although he enjoyed much success early in his career, his allure never reached the stature of the once promising Vick. The city never embraced him quite as tight as they did No. 7.</p>\n<p>The fact is many experts pegged Ryan as someone who would go down as a solid NFL quarterback, but not one that will win multiple, if even one championship. As the years progressed and his play seemed to flat line, this prediction seemed as though it would become true.</p>\n<p>The nine-year quarterback responded with easily the best season of his career, as he passed for career highs in both passing yards (4,944) and touchdowns (38) while throwing a career-low seven interceptions. Using all the weapons he has at his disposal, Ryan did not waste a single snap this year.</p>\n<p>Now, Atlanta and Ryan go hand-in-hand and the two seem to feed off each other in many ways. For the Falcons, Ryan might be the first truly great quarterback to bring them a championship, while Ryan has found a home in Atlanta and seems to love playing there as much as anyone else ever has.</p>\n<p>10 years ago, no one could have expected the Falcons to make such a quick recovery. After being blown out at home by the Packers in the 2011 Divisional Round, no one could have expected Matt Ryan to be the quarterback to lead the Falcons to the promise land. These two underdogs really do deserve each other come Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Falcons organization is truly becoming one of the greats in the NFL, and it started with the drafting of a 23-year-old quarterback from Boston College.</p>\n<p>Despite the MVP play from Ryan, Atlanta has made plenty of other tremendous decisions that have allowed them to enjoy the luxury of playing on the final Sunday of the NFL season. The drafting of star players like Julio Jones, Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, among others brought a new light back to Atlanta, and that has it set up for greatness.</p>\n<p>For those wondering if the Falcons Super Bowl run was just a fluke, you should consider the fact that Atlanta went 11-5 this season against the NFL’s toughest schedule in the league based on prior year’s record and won its division, easily going 5-1 with its only loss coming in week one to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>\n<p>Once more, the Falcons held down one of the best offenses in the entire league, ranking second in total yards and passing yards per game. They possessed the fifth best rushing attack at 120.5 rushing yards per game and owned the league’s highest scoring offense, averaging 33.8 points per game; no other team even averaged more than 30 points per game this year.</p>\n<p>Winners of their last six ball games, including playoffs, the Falcons are certainly coming in as a team that caught fire at the right time.

It figured to be a favorable matchup for UCSB, as the men had won their past eleven matches, while the women claimed a five-match win streak against the Mustangs. The Gauchos also defeated their rival earlier in the season in their first match with a final score of 171-123 on the women’s side and 161-129 on the men’s side.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thankfully for the Gauchos, their swimmers continued their outstanding trend and came out with the victory against the Mustangs with the scores being 190.5-101.5 for the men and 165-129 for the women. This extends the men’s win streak over the Mustangs to twelve while the women now own a six game win streak against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Junior freestyle/IM events swimmer Billy Mullis performed outstanding once again for the Gauchos as he went on to win two individual events against the Mustangs. He took first place in the 200 yard freestyle with a time of 1:39.66 and another victory in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 1:45.75.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Junior Sprint Freestyle swimmer Cheyenne Low also had a solid performance for the women. She took two individual victories against the Mustangs and won the 100 yard backstroke with a time of 55:63. Low also worked the field and took the victory in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 2:00.99 to give her two first place solo victories on the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mullin and Low are only two swimmers of the many on the talented Gauchos roster that contributed to this fantastic victory. Julia Mikota (23.90) won the 50 yard women freestyle with a time of 23.90 and she also won another event in the 100 yard freestyle with a time of 51.86. Another large contributor to this victory for the Gauchos was their relay teams. At the beginning of the meet, the men’s “A”  relay took first in the 200 yard medley relay with a time of 1:30.26, while the women’s “A” relay also took first in the same event with a time of 1:43.74. Towards the end of the match, the women’s A relay again stole a victory with a time of 3:30.10, and their “B” relay was right behind them with a second place time of 3:33.27.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This victory gives the Gauchos swim teams two excellent records to finish the season, with the men ending with a 5-2 record and the women finishing with a 5-1 record, respectively. This win only added to the amazing regular seasons that the two Gaucho swim teams had, and to demoralize their rivals in the final regular season game truly seems to be the cherry on top.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, this was a big win for the Gauchos and gives them tremendous momentum going into the at MPSF Championship, which will be taking place in February. This regular season was also a large stepping stone for what could be in store in the postseason. The Gaucho swim teams seem to have the recipe for success, and it seems as if they could definitely make a deep run the way they’re tearing up the pool as of late. It should be fun to watch, as the mixture of youth, experience, talent, and dedication is all coming together for the Gauchos at the perfect time of the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rest of the Gaucho swim season starts with the MPSF Championship, which will take place in East Los Angeles, California. This Championship, which are all day events and do not have specific start times, starts on <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1366519119\"><span class=\"aQJ\">February 15</span></span>, and lasts until <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1366519120\"><span class=\"aQJ\">February 18</span></span>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75481\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75481\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/","id":1790,"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava"},"related":[1789,1788,1787],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Leave ITA Kickoff Empty Handed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At enduring matches both at home and on the road, the UCSB women's tennis team remains winless after losses to No. 13 Texas Tech and No. 16 South Carolina over the weekend.

Baker and Yamada matched up well against Federici and Dvorak, but the UCSB pair eventually lost 7-5 after having an extremely competitive match.</p>\n<p>With doubles victories all tied up at one, it was up to Gaucho tandem junior Natalie Da Silveira and senior Jaimee Gilbertson to clinch the doubles point for their squad. Da Silveira and Gilbertson were able to do exactly that as they came away with a victory against Lady Raider pair Felicity Maltby and Gabriela Talaba with a score of (7-6), 7-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos doubles play proved strong against a Texas Tech squad which was a formidable test but not enough to take away the doubles point from UCSB.</p>\n<p>In singles play, the first match of the meet to finish saw TTU’s Katelyn Jackson defeat sophomore Stephanie Yamada: 6-2, 6-0. The second match to finish was Sabrina Federici and Amanda Atanasson where Federici was able to win the game in two sets with a score of 7-5 and 6-1. Stojic later lost to Sarah Dvorak in the third match where Stojic was competitive in the first set but later lost in two straight sets at a score of 7-6 (7-5), 6-2</p>\n<p>After three matches, the Lady Raiders were leading singles play with three victories and it was up to the Gauchos to find a way to end the Lady Raiders’ winning streak and pull out a victory in the remaining matches.</p>\n<p>As the match progressed, No. 26 ranked Gabriela Talaba defeated UCSB’s Dubavets by set scores of 6-4, 3-6 and 6-2, extending the winning streak to four.</p>\n<p>With Talaba’s win Texas Tech was able to come away with the victory in doubles play, despite the Gauchos winning the final two games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did well in doubles play but were unable to get anything going in singles play which saw only two Gauchos, Jaimee Gilbertson and Natalie Da Silveira, leave with a victory.</p>\n<p>The Texas Tech Lady Raiders defeated the UCSB Gauchos 4-2 in overall play leaving the Gauchos with a loss after the first day of play.</p>\n<p>The second day of play began on Sunday which left the Gauchos to face the South Carolina Gamecocks, who picked up a loss in their match against the Arizona State Sun Devils the day before.</p>\n<p>Doubles play began the day, which saw the Gamecocks come away with the victory as they won two of the three games. In the first match the Gamecocks’ pair of Hadley Berg and Paige Cline defeated the Gauchos pair of Stojic and Dubavets handily at a 6-1 finish.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded with a victory as Baker and Yamada defeated Brigit Folland and Caroline Dailey 6-2.</p>\n<p>In the deciding game to win the doubles point, the Gauchos fell as Gilbertson and Da Silveira lost to Rachel Rohrabacher and Mia Horvit.</p>\n<p>In singles play, the Gauchos were looking to bounce back but were yet again met with a tough challenge as Texas Tech gained an early 3-0 lead, leaving Dubavets as the only winning Gaucho in singles play.</p>\n<p>The Lady Raiders’ Brigit Folland, Hadley Berg, and Silvia Chinellato defeated their opponents and contributed to the team’s overall victory with a final score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were expecting to play against some very tough opponents during ITA Kickoff Weekend, and combined with an inability to succeed in singles play, contributed to the team’s disappointing performance.</p>\n<p>Positives for the Gauchos were in doubles play as they came away with one doubles point and were competitive in their loss of the doubles point to the Gamecocks.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos is an away game against UCLA on Friday, Feb. 3 at 1:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75305\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-leave-ita-kickoff-empty-handed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75305\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-leave-ita-kickoff-empty-handed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-leave-ita-kickoff-empty-handed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-leave-ita-kickoff-empty-handed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-leave-ita-kickoff-empty-handed/","id":68,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[67,66,65],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Routs UC Irvine On the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=800%2C419&ssl=1","description":"After having its four-game winning streak ended in its previous, the UCSB women's basketball team got back on the winning track with a blowout win over UC Irvine on Saturday.

It was the fourth consecutive loss for the Anteaters, placing them in eighth at 3-18 and 1-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s three-point shooting barrage was active from the game’s first quarter as it went 7-10 from long distance. All but one of the Gauchos’ eight field goals were made from downtown as they made seven-straight to close the period.</p>\n<p>Both Hernandez and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter, who returned from injury after sitting out the game at CSUN, were spot-on from long range. Each scored nine points in the opening period to power UCSB’s 23-7 run. Limited to 11 minutes, Porter was proactive with her time on the court as she ended with 15 points on 5-8 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine, who was without two starters due to injury and had just three players coming off its bench, couldn’t find its rhythm on the offensive end. The Anteaters ended the first period with more made free-throws at 4-4 than field goals at 3-for-10.</p>\n<p>Scoring one of UCI’s field goals and half of their free-throws was senior forward Shereen Sutherland. She had a team-high 20 points on 5-for-11 shooting and a career-high 10-of-11 free-throw performance. Still, the Anteaters trailed 23-11 at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s dominance continued in the following quarter with a 9-2 scoring run. Hernandez added two more three-pointers before halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe silently had an efficient performance of 12 points on 4-for-6 and 2-for-2 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>Also making an impact was the emergence of UCSB’s bench. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler and sophomore guard Makala Roper each were effective as Toler was fearless in her drive for layups and Roper followed suit along with displaying her midcourt range.</p>\n<p>A made layup by Roper gave the Gauchos a 43-19 advantage with 1:37 remaining before the half. She ended the game with nine points, while Toler had 12 points and a team-high three steals. Hernandez scored UCSB’s last basket of the quarter with a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>Although UCI’S senior forward Brittany Glassow responded with a three-point make of her own, it did not have much of an impact on the Anteaters’ deficit as they trailed 46-24 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Glassow led Irvine’s small bench rotation with six points on 2-for-3, 1-for-1 three-point shooting and tied for the team-high of six rebounds in 29 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Similar to how they both started the game, both Hernandez and Porter sustained their hot shooting hands in the second half. Pouring on makes from three-point land, both backcourt players went 2-for-3 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Porter was responsible for six points during the Gauchos’ 8-0 run in which they tallied their largest lead of 30 points at 60-30.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s spark came from Sutherland with nine points and senior guard Irene Chavez with five points but would not be enough to prevent the Gauchos from entering the fourth quarter 73-44 lead.</p>\n<p>A 5-0 run to open the fourth quarter showed the Anteaters’ unwillingness to accept defeat, but they couldn’t contain the Gauchos from closing out the game behind the play of Toler.</p>\n<p>Toler scored three-straight layups, scoring the majority of the team’s five field goals in the quarter. Despite its ability to make 18-of-23 free-throws, UCI’s poor shooting of 38.8 percent and 4-for-16 three-point shooting curtailed any chance of it making a comeback as UCSB earned the victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to the Thunderdome to face Cal State Fullerton this Wednesday, Feb. 1. at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/","id":452,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[451,450,449],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast Wagner, Fall to Arizona State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its first road trip of the season, the UCSB women's water polo split its pair of matchup at the ASU Invitational.

The Gauchos matched their season high for goals in a quarter with six as they outscored the Seahawks 6-3 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Over a minute into the second quarter, senior utility Taylor Shore threw in her first goal of the day to bring the Gauchos within one. Watson responded by netting her hat trick to bring the lead back to two goals for Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then went on a 3-0 scoring run to take their first lead of the afternoon at 5-4. Redshirt freshman attacker Shannon Moran began the scoring run followed by goals from Shore and freshman utility Sarah Snyder who continued her tremendous goal scoring run.</p>\n<p>Snyder finished the game with four goals which adds to her team high total of 15 goals on the season. The freshman also contributed with two assists this game and is the only gaucho to score in every game up to this point.</p>\n<p>Wagner added two more goals to their total as they took the lead once again, but UCSB returned the favor with two goals scored by Snyder and freshman attacker Natalie Selin ending the half on top 7-6.</p>\n<p>“Wagner came out battling and I give them a lot of credit,” UCSB Head Coach Serela Kay said. “They never backed down the whole game.”</p>\n<p>It took over half of the third quarter to get the first goal of the half. After that Seahawks equalizer, the Gauchos finished the quarter off with two goals in quick succession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara extended their unanswered goal scoring streak to four when they scored the first two goals of the fourth quarter. At this point the Gauchos had a cushioned 11-7 advantage with just 5:35 to go.</p>\n<p>After conceding three straight goals, including two over the final 1:29, the Gauchos held on for what turned out to be a nail-biting victory in the end.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a little out of control on our defensive end and even offensively just taking care of the ball,” Kay said. “We found a way to win, we found a way to hold on.”</p>\n<p>Aside from some mistakes in this game, the defense was solid yet again just like it has been all year for the Gauchos. They have only allowed over eight goals in two games this season. If you exclude the blowout loss to USC, the Gauchos have only conceded about 6.7 goal per game.</p>\n<p>The freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who had nine saves versus Wagner, has been a big part of the defensive success.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder holds down the cage for us and she has a high game IQ,” Kay said. “She has not only a physical presence but also a presence vocally in the cage and I think that makes a big difference for us.”</p>\n<p>Next up were the hosts Arizona State who came into the meeting with a 2-0 record having won their first two games of the Invitational.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils began the scoring at the 5:02 mark in the first quarter. In the ensuing possession, Shore assisted Selin for her second goal of the weekend to even the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Two minutes into the second period, freshman utility Kate Coski chalked up her fourth score of the season. At 2-1 this turned out to be the first and only lead for the Gauchos in this one.</p>\n<p>The hosts levelled 15 seconds later and then took the lead with under two minutes remaining in the half.</p>\n<p>As the half was winding down, Trabucco equalized with her first of two goals in the game. The half came to an end all even at 3-3 in Tempe, Ariz.</p>\n<p>“I was happy about the way that we competed right from the start,” Kay said. “Anytime you you’re playing a team 1-1 in the first quarter and then 3-3 at half that says that you’re playing solid defense and both teams are battling.”</p>\n<p>ASU turned it on the third quarter with four goals while not conceding any at the other end of the pool. UCSB was even with Arizona State in every quarter except the third which ended up costing them the game.</p>\n<p>“We made some poor choices offensively that led to goals for them that set up their offense,” Kay said. “We’re young and the season is early so it’s important at this point that we learn from that third quarter. I think it’s important when things get a little out of our control that we learn to be resilient.”</p>\n<p>The final score was 8-4 as ASU finished off their undefeated weekend. Santa Barbara ended the invitational splitting their two games in Tempe.</p>\n<p>Kay was very pleased with what this young team was able to do on their first road trip against a couple of strong sides. However, with the youth comes some natural obstacles to get around.</p>\n<p>“We need to focus on the details,” Kay said. “We need to realize that it’s the little things that make big things happen.”</p>\n<p>After a short break, UCSB will continue their season at the Triton Invitational in San Diego on February 11<sup>th</sup>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75374\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75374\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/","id":4925,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4924,4923,4922],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Volleyball Drops Second-Straight to Bruins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-30-at-1.28.13-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-30-at-1.28.13-PM.png?resize=799%2C439&ssl=1","description":"Depsite having the home court advantage in both matches, the UCSB men's volleyball team lost its second-straight match to the UCLA Bruins.

That, combined with a more commanding UCLA performance in the third set gave the visitors a 3-0 sweep over the Gauchos. It was the Bruins second consecutive sweep of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Friday’s 3-0 sweep did show signs of improvement compared to Wednesday’s 3-0 sweep, as rough a sight for Gaucho eyes as those results are.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, in Westwood, UCSB fell behind early in sets one and three, allowing UCLA to coast to two easy set victories.</p>\n<p>The second set was a closer match to Friday’s first two sets, as the Gauchos kept it close throughout and even led 14-11 at one point. Ultimately, however, that similarity extended to the result of the set, which the Bruins, now 8-1 overall and 6-0 in league, won 25-20 thanks to a four point run to close it out.</p>\n<p>Star outside hitter Jacob Delson was the only Gaucho on Wednesday to break double digits in kills with 13, while setter Casey McGarry put up 21 assists on the night. UCLA also only had one player in double digit kills – Jake Arnitz with 10 – but that was more a reflection of the Bruins’ well-roundedness than it was of any offensive struggles.</p>\n<p>On Friday, things were much the same for the Gauchos statistically. Delson just barely cracked the double-digit mark with 11 kills, and Corey Cheevers finished close behind with eight. The assists were different, as it was freshman setter Randy DeWeese who led the team with 26.</p>\n<p>It seemed initially that UCSB might have learned from their Westwood thrashing on Wednesday. The Gauchos led early and held that lead into the middle of the first set, stretching their advantage to a comfortable 17-13 spread at one point.</p>\n<p>UCLA responded to that challenge just like the second-ranked team in the nation should, ripping off a 12-5 run to take the lead and close out the set.</p>\n<p>A Keenan Sanders kill opened up the second set, and put the Gauchos up, but that was the only lead UCSB would hold in the second act. The two teams battled back and forth throughout the entire set, with UCLA’s 13-9 lead being the largest differential for either team. In the end, the Gauchos were unable to turn the tide back against the Bruins, who racked up two straight kills to squeak out a 25-22 win.</p>\n<p>Coming on the heels of the back-and-forth, tensely fought first two sets, the third set was a bit of a snoozefest. UCLA flew out of the gate with a four-point run to start and went up 7-1 in short order.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos clawed back into contention with a four-point run of their own to make it 7-5, but by the middle of the set the Bruins had things firmly under control.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a week off until its next game against Hawaii in Honolulu. The match is scheduled to take place at 9 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75308\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75308\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/","id":5008,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5007,5006,5005],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":61,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
