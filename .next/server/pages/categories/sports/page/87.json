Milen Ianakiev and Santiago Cavallos with a 6-1 win on two, set San Diego up for the doubles point and the duo of Hendrik Jebens and Sander Gjoels-Andersen sealed it despite fighting a close battle on three that ended 7-6.</p>\n<p>The No. 44 team of seniors Nathan Eshmade and Miles Seemann battled back to what was nearly a victory on court one at 5-4 in their favor, but time expired with the completions of the other matches.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing 1-0, Santa Barbara took five of the six singles matches, three of which came in straight sets.</p>\n<p>Freshman No. 83 Nicolas Moreno de Alboran was the first off his court at two with a straight set win over Jebens 6-4, 6-4. This win notches the freshman’s sixth straight in dual match play, most of which have also come in sweeps.</p>\n<p>Junior captain Morgan Mays finished just a game later on court three topping his opponent in two sets as well. The junior put his team up 2-1 on the board with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Ianakiev.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs picked up a sweep of their own on court four to ice the match at 2-2. San Diego’s Marko Goles-Babic had the one answer of the match for the Aztecs as he bested sophomore Cody Rakela 6-3, 6-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would be the team to break the tie with another win, this time on court six. Junior Teague Hamilton picked up his first win of the season in his first match defeating Jonas Meinzer 6-4, 7-6(2). With just one more match needed for the win, the Gauchos had freshman Anders Holm and Eshmade playing in third set matches.</p>\n<p>Holm sealed the victory for his team finishing his match on court five. The young Gaucho topped Gjoels-Andersen in a best of three 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 to give his team the overall win. Nathan Eshmade added another point for the Gauchos, despite sealing the match victory, as he defeated a ranked opponent in No. 69 Freddy Gelbrich. The senior gave his team a strong final score of 5-2 as he took the last two sets of his match 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.</p>\n<p>“It was a tough first set for me, my opponent was getting some very good serves in,” Eshmade said. “I really came back in the second and found my rhythm.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will carry their five-match win streak into their home opener this weekend.

Although Adler lost the first set 3-6, she came back to serve a double bagel, winning the next two sets 6-0.</p>\n<p>The next day against the Dons, Adler had a tougher time sealing a match point for UCSB as she went to three sets against junior Thyra Taune in a close matchup. the gaucho dropped the first set 3-6 coming off slow out the gate, she then went on to steal the second set 7-5. The final set went to the sophomore in a 13-11 contest that went back and forth as much as the tennis ball did.</p>\n<p>“It was hard because I was down 6/3 5/2 and I won 5 tough games in a row to come back into the match, and it asked me a lot of mental energy,” said UCSB Sophomore Lou Adler. “I knew I had to stay tough, keep playing my game and be very consistent… I always believed I could do it besides the score.”</p>\n<p>The rest of the team delivered solid performances as well to ensure the 6-1 win. The Dons defaulted in the number six singles match and the number three slot for doubles giving the Gauchos a point advantage before the first whistle ever blew.</p>\n<p>The team from San Francisco did not intend to go down easy as they continued to fight for every point. The first Double’s match went to the Dons as they defeated sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Jaimee Gilbertson 6-1. However UCSB won the doubles point with quick work by junior Melissa Baker and the freshman from Sydney, Stephanie Yamada, defeating their opposition 6-0. The end of doubles play left Santa Barbara up ahead 2-0.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Palina Dubavets lost in a close contest against red shirt senior Andrea Ka from USF going all three sets giving the Dons its only point of the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However UCSB still managed to ensure the win and now are 4-4 overall and 1-0 in conference.

In the fifth inning a sac fly by sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier and a big two-RBI single by redshirt sophomore outfielder Josh Adams gave them a solid 5-1 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>The game was sealed in the seventh inning when Adams hit a big two-run homer to give his team a 7-1 lead. UCSB gave up two runs in the ninth inning, however, it still hung on and won the game 7-3. Redshirt sophomore Joe Record had a great outing on Sunday on allowing three hits and one run with five strikeouts in seven innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Our guys did a good job.” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We did a great job on the mound, Joe [record] had a solid game.”</p>\n<p>Before Santa Barbara achieved the sweep, it first had to play a doubleheader, something that is tough for any team. However, the Gauchos had a fast start in the late game that made it a bit easier for them.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out firing offensively scoring three runs in the first inning. After two Dons runs in the second inning, the Gauchos responded by scoring two runs of their own, including a great homerun by Calica, and maintaining a three run lead at 5-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s most effective inning came in the bottom of the fourth when it scored six runs and took a solid 11-2 lead. It eventually won the game 13-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offensive prowess was highlighted by all nine hitters recording at least one hit and the team having 19 hits as a whole. Calica’s 3-5 day, which included the aforementioned homerun, and sophomore Clay Fisher four singles were notable performances in UCSB’s great offensive day.</p>\n<p>In the earlier game, Santa Barbara had an early scare when they found themselves down 5-1 heading in the bottom of the sixth inning. The Dons offense was led by junior outfielder Harrison Bruce who went 2-4 with 3 RBI and junior Dan James who hit the first homerun of the season for the Dons in the second inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos comeback effort began in the sixth inning when Plantier started the three-run rally with a single. Four of the next six UCSB batters got hits which led to the three runs that cut the Dons lead to just one.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara completed its comeback in the eighth inning when junior outfielder Devon Gradford hit a sac fly that put two runners in scoring position. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark batted the two runners and give his team a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>The Dons tried to put together an effort in the final inning, however, the offense dried out as sophomore Kyle Nelson pitched a 1-2-3 inning to seal the victory for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Before UCSB played a brutal doubleheader, in its season opener redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno had the game of his life to lead his team that day. The second baseman had a solid hitting day going 3-5 with 4 RBI and came just a single shy of hitting the cycle.</p>\n<p>“I was floating out there for a while.” Muno said. “I had no idea what was going on it was amazing.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos season started hot with three scores in the first inning which began with Muno’s double. Plantier batted in his second baseman with a single and redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover hit in two more runners later in the inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB allowed one run at the top of the second but Muno hit a two-RBI triple that gave his team a 5-1 lead. The sophomore’s homerun in the fourth inning gave the Gauchos a commanding 7-1 lead.</p>\n<p>After taking a 7-1 lead, Santa Barbara gave up one run but also added one to win the game 8-2 and start the season off the right way, with a win.</p>\n<p>“We were pretty solid defensively.” Checketts said. “We did a lot of good things and got a good lead early.”</p>\n<p>Right-handed pitcher Shane Beiber had a solid outing going seven innings deep and only allowing two runs. The junior also had four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“I thought our guys on the mound did a great job.” Checketts said. “Beiber was in character and threw some solid strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos perfect start to the season is a great sign of things to come. The young team seemed poise to battle and showed fans new players that seem as though they will contribute a lot to this team.</p>\n<p>“There was so much offensive production,” Checketts said. “I was happy with performances from guys like Clark, Muno. Clark in particular hits in the nine-hole and when your ninth batter bats .450 that’s a good sign.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday at 2 p.m. against St. Mary’s at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Our defense, energy, and everything about us is getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, which was 3-5 and in sixth place in conference to begin the month of February, now improves to 7-5 in the Big West with an overall record of 13-12. The Gauchos are two games back from second place UC Irvine and Long Beach State, both hosting a Big West record of 9-3.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aggies, 10-16 overall, lose their fourth straight game and drop to a conference record of 5-8.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten back over the break even mark and that’s a very good thing,” Williams stated. “I thought we played really hard tonight. We didn’t shoot well, which they had a lot to do with, but we played very hard.”</p>\n<p>While it wasn’t the cleanest first half for either team, committing a total of 21 turnovers, the Gauchos jumped out to a 31-20 advantage at halftime due to the shooting hand of Vincent. The shooting guard out of Stockton, CA went 4-7 from the field scoring seven of his teams first 13 points. Vincent led all scorers at the break with 10 points.</p>\n<p>Drawing two early fouls and struggling to find his rhythm offensively, senior guard Michael Bryson made his presence known in other categories during the first half. The 6’4” wing recorded seven rebounds, two blocks, and three steals. Bryson also hit home six of his teams seven free throws in the first period, going a perfect six-for six behind the free throw stripe.</p>\n<p>Facing an uphill battle similar to their match on Thursday, the Aggies clawed their way back in the second half this time from 11-points. Davis shaved the Gauchos’ lead down to five with 18:27 to go as junior Brynton Lamar finished strong to the rack and then followed it up with a mid-range jump shot to have his team trail 26-31.</p>\n<p>The third year guard finished second in scoring for Davis on Saturday, one point shy of senior Josh Fox’s team-high 17 points. Not only Lemar keep the game within reach scoring 11 of his 16 points in the second half, the San Diego, CA native earned himself a double-double crashing the boards on offense and defense for a total of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite a strong effort from Fox and Lemar, the Gauchos ended the game in dramatic fashion as junior guard Eric Childress led a 3-on-2 break and dished a no-look pass to Vincent for the go-ahead dunk with 1:02 remaining. Vincent’s slam magnified UCSB’s lead to 10 after that point.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also had a major boost from its bench, including a 9-point contribution from senior forward Mitch Brewe. The 6’8” senior scored seven of his nine points in the first half and helped add to the Gauchos’ season-high 13 steals with two picks.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to bring a lot of energy physicality, and a big defensive presence [tonight],” Brewe said. “I didn’t do a good job of finishing in the beginning of the game but [afterwards] got in a rhythm a little bit. I think coming off the bench bringing a lot of energy and keeping the level high is really important.”</p>\n<p>“It was a team win for everybody tonight,” said Childress. “We just knew we had to make plays.[Davis] is a physical team and when we have a night like this when we’re not shooting well we have to be aggressive back with them and our bench came in and did that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has outscored its opponents’ bench in each of its last four games, averaging 20.5 points per game. This is a reasonable chunk of their 70.1 point average per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sets foot on its two-game road trip this week starting with a Thursday night match against Cal State Northridge and a Saturday game at Fullerton. The Gauchos game at CSUN will take place in the Matadome at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68480\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68480\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/","id":348,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[347,346,345],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Game Lay-Up Drowns UCSB in 58-55 Loss to LBSU Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A costly turnover in the last minute of Saturday's game versus Long Beach State resulted in the UCSB women's basketball team being defeated by the 49ers 58-55.

We forced her middle to her left hand which is where she wants to go and it’s an And-1. Just undisciplined.”</p>\n<p>Hope remained on the UCSB sideline as junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe dashed coast to coast for the game-tying layup with 10 seconds to send the game into overtime. But the Gauchos’ comeback chances were ended when 49ers’ junior forward Madison Montgomery rejected the layup attempt prompting the game’s ending with a 58-55 LBSU victory after a made free-throw by junior guard Anna Kim.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 10-17 overall and 7-6 in the Big West. Long Beach State improved to 19-7 and 8-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s loss made the race for a top-four seed in the Big West Conference standings more challenging for the Gauchos as they missed out on the opportunity to tie the 49ers for fourth-place. In addition to UC Davis losing to UCR, Long Beach State was able to move up to third-place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>However, during Saturday’s post-game interview, Coach Henrickson assured the media that the team’s standing was the least of her worries with three games remaining in the regular season.</p>\n<p>“The best thing we could have done was beat Long Beach [Saturday],” Henrickson said. “I’ve looked at the format, but I need to focus on us playing better. I don’t get caught up in all of that. If we play well, all that will take care of itself.”</p>\n<p>The format of the Big West Tournament permits the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds to skip the first two rounds of the tournament onto the semifinal. As for the No. 3 and No. 4 seeds, they are granted a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that UCSB will earn a No. 1 or No. 2 seed at this point in the season, but the Gauchos could possibly earn the No. 3 seed or a likely No. 4 seed as UC Davis sits ahead of UCSB in fourth-place at 8-5 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>With low-scoring totals from both teams, the largest lead of Saturday’s game was from Long Beach by a deficit of seven. Three points was the largest scoring differential by quarters as the 49ers narrowly outscored UCSB 16-13 in the third period.</p>\n<p>No player in UCSB’s starting lineup finished with double-figures in points, leaving the offensive duties to the Gauchos’ reserves off the bench.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB was more efficient shooting the ball than LBSU amassing a 45.2 field goal percentage to the 49ers’ 36.2 percentage. Santa Barbara was able to surpass the 49ers’ full-court press and 2-3 zone defense, but still had 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“I thought the press was better at their place,” Henrickson said. “But how many of those [turnovers] are unforced? Travel, dribble pick-ups, and throwing it out of bounds. It’s just undisciplined. That’s my responsibility, I’ve got a role in that as well. They [LBSU] can turn us over, but we turned ourselves over.”</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara in points was senior guard Jasmine Ware with 16 points as she nearly registered her first-career triple-double tallying eight assists and six rebounds as well. Adding to the Gauchos’ production off the bench was Newton, who recorded her second double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Newton’s 6-6 performance at the free throw line in the first half provided the majority of points in Santa Barbara’s 10-2 run, giving it a 27-25 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>In spite of its momentum to close out the first half, UCSB was sluggish in the second half and failed to contain LBSU in the opening of the third quarter, allowing the 49ers to go on a 9-0 run to take a 34-27 lead.</p>\n<p>“I thought we were terrible and we were up by two,” Henrickson said. We had no pop, no energy. [It shows] how consistent you have to be, how well you have to play, and how hard you have to play every single night. We’re not flying around, it’s quiet… that’s frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Yet, UCSB’s 5-0 scoring run after calling a timeout trimmed its deficit to two at 32-34.</p>\n<p>Two quick fouls during the first quarter led to Benton playing in just three minutes of the first half as she sat out the entirety of the second quarter, having taken no shot attempts in the first half.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first half, Benton erupted for all 19 of her points in the second half. She scored the 49ers’ last 11 points of the third quarter and had eight points in the fourth quarter. She concluded Saturday shooting 7-11 from the field and went 5-6 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>The 49ers entered Saturday’s matchup shooting over 35 percent from beyond the arc in conference play, but were contained to a 23.5 three-point percentage, going 4-17 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>However, draining two pivotal three-pointers was sophomore guard Gigi Hascheff.

Seniors Guard Michael Bryson and forward John Green led the way for UCSB, scoring 11 of the team’s first 15 points to help set the Gauchos up with a 15-6 lead prompting them to never trail at any point of Thursday’s contest.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored the first six points for UCSB, including a layup just 18 seconds into the game. Green came off the bench in attack mode, hitting a mid-range jumper and three-pointer all within the 11<sup>th</sup> minute of the first half. The two went 7-11 from the floor in the first half, playing a major role in UCSB’s 29-18 advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior guard T.J. Taylor also added the exclamation point with seven seconds left in the first. Off a UCR turnover, Taylor went coast-to-coast maneuvering past a defender and hit a buzzer-beating three with one second to spare.</p>\n<p>Taylor tied season-highs with eight points and four assists in nineteen minutes off the bench.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders had their troubles in the first half, shooting 7-28 from the field, guards Gentrey Thomas and Jaylen Bland helped turn things around. Riverside chipped at its 11-point deficit as Thomas connected on a three-point shot followed by a strong finish to the rim. This five-point swing helped pull the score to 32-30 with 16:40 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Helping bring UCR within the Gauchos’ lead was the Highlanders’ senior captain in Bland. With 6:40 left in regulation, Bland knocked down his 100<sup>th</sup> three-pointer of the season, a Big West best, to trim UCSB’s lead to 50-44 with 6:40 to go.</p>\n<p>While Bland entered Thursday with the fourth-best scoring average in the Big West of 16.5 points per game, the Murray State transfer did not have the most efficient shooting night from the floor, going 4-15 overall and 3-11 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Bland has had a rocky scoring stretch during his past three games, averaging 8.3 points per game including a 1-8 shooting night and season-low five points against Cal Poly on Feb. 13.</p>\n<p>With the Highlanders quickly on its heels, Santa Barbara converted at the free-throw line going 11-12 in the final six minutes to secure its victory. Overall, UCSB went 18-25 from behind the free-throw line, including the reliable foul shooting of senior forward Sam Beeler, who hit four of his six made free-throws in the last five minutes of play.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Johns, the Highlanders relied heavily on junior forward Secean Johnson to keep UCR within reach. After losing his starting spot last Saturday to sophomore forward Alex Larsson, the Juco transfer had a monster game playing all but five minutes Thursday night as he led Riverside in scoring with 21 points.</p>\n<p>Johnson recorded his second double-double of the season, grabbing 10 rebounds in the match—five offensive and five defensive. His versatility on the court resulted in him recording two assists, one block, and a pair of steals as well. However, Johnson’s performance was not enough to stall UCSB from earning its 65-55 win.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Gauchos collecting their sixth conference victory of the season, Head Coach Bob Williams joined Pacific’s Bob Thomason and UNLV’s Jerry Tarkanian as the only coaches in Big West history to ever achieve 300 wins.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to defend home court in a rematch versus UC Davis tomorrow, Feb. 20 as tip-off will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/","id":346,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[345,344,343],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope to Continue Success Against LMU & USF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-04-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After a successful 2-1 record last weekend, the Gauchos hope to keep improving against LMU and USF.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68281\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68281\" data-attachment-id=\"68281\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/gauchos-hope-to-continue-success-against-lmu-usf/amanda-atnasson-returns-the-ball-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-04-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Amanda Atnasson returns the ball.

The Gauchos have started slow but have begun to show signs of improvement after a 2-1 record this past weekend including a historical victory for Head Coach Simon Thibodeau.</p>\n<p>The two wins and one loss gives UCSB an overall record of 2-4 and a solid 1-0 start to conference play after defeating UC Davis. Memphis drops to 1-5 on the season, while Washington State keeps its perfect 10-0 record after defeating the Gauchos. UC Davis is now 4-4 after the weekend with a 1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos received their first team win of the season against Memphis by defeating them 4-0. After losing their next match in another close competition versus Washington State, 4-3, Santa Barbara convincingly beat conference rival UC Davis 4-0 to mark win number 200 for the UCSB head coach.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It just means that i’ve left a mark, on the program as a head coach. It makes me feel a bit old as well. But it’s definitely more credit to all the players, celebration of the players and assistant coaches over the past 16 years.” Said Head Coach Thibodeau on reaching a tremendous milestone.</p>\n<p>Although the UCSB women’s tennis team beat the Aggies and the Tigers with a similar 4-0 score to ensure the 200th career win for head coach Thibodeau, the Gauchos dropped another 8 places in the national rankings.</p>\n<p>“It would be a nice bonus to be higher ranked and we can always promote better when we are highly ranked, but we have proven to be tough competition… Now we can just focus on getting better,” Coach Thibodeau stated. “A point here and there that would make the difference… Learning more about this team as the season continues and find the right combinations.”</p>\n<p>However, the rankings do not properly reflect the prowess of this young roster who is preparing to carry the momentum of the recent wins into the upcoming matches.</p>\n<p>LMU has struggled early on in the season mustering a 1-4 start and losing to a plethora of unranked opponents. The Lions’ duo of senior Andrea Crespo and junior Julia Norlin will more than likely have to face UCSB duo Stefani Stojic and Palina Dubavets, who are ranked No. 10 in the nation in doubles.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos face off against the Lions, they will compete against USF. San Francisco is currently winless at 0-6 as they have also played against a number of nationally ranked teams. Losing to No. 38 Long Beach State, No. 41 Dartmouth, and No. 8 Michigan.</p>\n<p>Although USF has played against top 50 schools just as UCSB has, they have not been able to muster up any more than a point per match; Whereas the Gauchos have lost by a point in each match.</p>\n<p>“RIght now we are testing a few things and see how different people react to different things, we could be 6-0 right now,” Coach Thibodeau said.<br>\nSanta Barbara faces off against LMU Saturday and USF Sunday both at 12 pm at the Recreation Center Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/gauchos-hope-to-continue-success-against-lmu-usf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/gauchos-hope-to-continue-success-against-lmu-usf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/gauchos-hope-to-continue-success-against-lmu-usf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/gauchos-hope-to-continue-success-against-lmu-usf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/gauchos-hope-to-continue-success-against-lmu-usf/","id":118,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[117,116,115],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Look Gauchos Open Season Against San Francisco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2015.05.15-StephenManga-BaseballvUCI-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2015.05.15-StephenManga-BaseballvUCI-2-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After a 40-17-1 finish last season, the Gauchos begin their 2016 campaign on Friday at home at Caeser Uyesaka Stadium versus the University of San Francisco.

This is because a record 10 of his players were drafted last year, including pitcher Dillon Tate, who was drafted fourth overall by the Texas Rangers. UCSB has the second-most draftees of any team in the country, only trailing Oklahoma’s 11 players drafted.</p>\n<p>“There has been a lot of turnover on the roster,” Checketts said. “However, we are returning some key pieces.”</p>\n<p>These key pieces include outfielder Andrew Calica and pitcher Shane Bieber. Calica is a career .321 hitter at the Division I level, while Bieber earned an All-Big West Second Team nod after co-leading the Big West in wins with 8 and a solid 2.24 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I’m counting on them [Calica and Beiber],” Checketts said. “They’re Friday night starters and have experience, including playing in regionals last year.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are also going to count on younger pieces such as sophomores Clay Fisher and Kyle Nelson. Fisher, an infielder, racked up 43 hits and 19 RBI’s, which were both seventh best on the team. Nelson, a left-handed pitcher, went 3-1 with a 0.75 ERA out of the bullpen to earn Freshman All-America honors.</p>\n<p>“We are new in some spots and we are excited for the younger players,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to see its new roster do some good things against a San Francisco squad who finished 23-31 last season. They ended the season on a seven game losing streak, meaning they will be excited to take the field against UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Dons are looking to players like infielder Dan James to lead the team this year. The junior had a .346 batting average, which was second best on the team. They will also look to former 2014 West Coast Conference All-Freshman Team Nico Giarratano. The junior hit a respectable .220 average in his 32 games.</p>\n<p>The new Santa Barbara line-up is what will have most people excited this season. After losing the aforementioned 10 players to the draft, it will be interesting to see how new players feel in their roles.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lot of question marks,” Checketts said. “There are still a lot of moving parts and we still are not sure of our exact lineup. We want to find ourselves and our identity, and it will take some time, but we are excited.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s season opener is at 2 p.m. Friday, Feb. 19 against San Francisco at Caeser Uyesaka stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Northridge fell to 6-19 overall, 4-7 in conference play.</p>\n<p>After scoring its first field goal at the 9:30 mark of the game, UCSB was unable to score its next basket until 3:40 remained in the first quarter. While UCSB struggled shooting the ball, CSUN managed to go on a 15-2 run. Helping establish this run was Fluker with nine points in the first quarter as CSUN ended the first period with a 20-6 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being held to just six points in the first quarter, UCSB answered with some lockdown defense of its own, holding CSUN to just six points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>“We put good pressure on the guards on the perimeter and made things uncomfortable,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Our double was good. We turned [Fluker] over three times, got a travel. Just to be disruptive always creates some offense from defense.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara forced 24 turnovers, recorded 14 steals, and outscored CSUN in points off turnovers 30-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ stout defense helped to resolve their cold shooting start to begin the game as they went on a 7-0 run to open the second period which brought them within a single-figure deficit of 13-20. As UCSB’s scoring run expanded, it ended the second quarter outscoring CSUN 24-6. Prompting UCSB’s scoring stretch was its improvement from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>After going scoreless from beyond the arc in the first 10 minutes of Thursday’s game, Santa Barbara sunk four of its six three-pointers in the second quarter. Igniting the Gauchos’ long-range shooting was freshman guard Coco Miller with two three-pointers. She concluded Thursday with 13 points on a 5-13 overall and 2-7 three-point shooting effort.</p>\n<p>A make from behind the perimeter by senior guard Dioseline Lopez brought the Gauchos within one-point of CSUN’s lead at 22-23.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 0-5 three-point shooting start in the first quarter, UCSB remained committed to its shot selection from beyond the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“I always tell those two [Roper and Miller] to shoot until your arm falls off,” Henrickson said. “Even if you’ve missed three or four, we all expect the next one to go and they have to have that mentality.”</p>\n<p>With a 27-26 lead, it was a three-pointer at the buzzer by Roper that shifted the momentum to UCSB’s advantage while extending the Gauchos’ lead to 30-26 at the half.</p>\n<p>“It all started with our defense, especially because we had a slow start,” Roper said. “Coach [Henrickson] really emphasized pressure on the defensive end in getting us better looks on offense.”</p>\n<p>Roper capitalized off the buzzer shot, scoring UCSB’s first field goal of the second half from beyond the arc while her last three-point basket of the game with 1:15 in the third handed the Gauchos their first double-figure lead of the game at 46-36.</p>\n<p>For the remainder of the game, Northridge trailed by a double-figure deficit. Its ability to get to the free-throw, where it made 11-14 in the second half, did not permit it to keep up with UCSB’s scoring pace.</p>\n<p>Although Fluker registered 19 of her 31 points in the second half, the Matadors were overcome by the Gauchos’ 51.6 field goal percentage in the final two quarters. In addition to Roper and Miller, senior guard Jasmine Ware’s 5-10 shooting performance and total of 10 points off the bench helped UCSB secure its 70-58 victory.</p>\n<p>Next on UCSB’s schedule is Long Beach State this Saturday, Feb. 20 at 2 p.m. The 49ers endured an 83-58 loss to UC Riverside Thursday night, bringing them to 18-7 overall and 7-4 in conference play. UCSB, currently in fifth-place of the Big West standings, could tie LBSU for fourth-place in the conference with a victory on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/","id":345,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[344,343,342],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Extend Streak Against UCR, Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team is fourth in the Big West standings with a 5-5 conference record and is could reach the .500 mark overall with a win over UCR tonight.

Aside from the 29 combined points that sophomore guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Michael Bryson tallied home, Bob Williams accredits this victory to a collective team effort from other players on his squad.</p>\n<p>“It’s crucial when other guys make contributions offensively for us [because] it turns us into a much more efficient team,” Williams said. “John Green was alive … Sam Beeler was really effective [on the floor], and Eric Childress continues to be money shooting the ball from the three-point line. This gives us a lot of balance because opponents are going to pay a lot of attention to Michael and Gabe.”</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos shot a season-high 23-26 from the free-throw line last Thursday.</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB will have to contain the senior duo of forward Taylor Johns and guard Jaylen Bland. The two are the best frontcourt-backcourt combo in the conference, combining for 32 points per game, Bland at 16.5 and Johns at 15.5.</p>\n<p>Johns carried the Highlanders in their 78-86 loss to Cal Poly last week. The senior scored a game-high 25 points in 38 minutes, also tallying his fifth double-double of the season with 10 boards.</p>\n<p>While Bland only scored five points in his last match, he and Johns have scored 20-plus or more points in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>Looking to avenge their six-point loss last Thursday and upset UCSB at home, junior guard and Darius Graham and senior forward Josh Fox will play pivotal roles Saturday night against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Graham is coming off a big game against the Gauchos scoring a game-high 19 points while going 3-4 from downtown. The 5-10” floor general has shown signs of being an offensive threat, leading Davis in scoring five times this season including a 21-point outing in its 58-55 win against Riverside.</p>\n<p>Big man Josh Fox will try and compliment Graham’s guard play down low in the post. Last year’s Big West Sixth Man of the Year, the forward has been having an unforgettable senior campaign leading all Aggies in scoring with 14.2 per game and field goal percentage with 51.5 percent. Fox has led his team in scoring 10 times this season while scoring 17 or more points in ten occasions.</p>\n<p>With regard to last Thursday at UC Davis, a conference win was not the only achievement Coach Williams accomplished against his former team. Coaching the Aggies from 1990-1998, the three-time Big West Coach of the Year collected his 299th win last Thursday.</p>\n<p>While this milestone is a notable one, just one victory shy of being the 3rd coach ever in conference to eclipse the 300-win mark, Williams says at this point it is just a number.</p>\n<p>“The win at Davis meant a lot to me because it was home for eight years … but I’m just not attached to the number of accumulated wins at this stage in my life,” Williams stated. “Maybe 10 years from now when I’m reading through a scrapbook that will be something that means something to me.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face UCR tonight at 8 p.m. UCSB returns to action in the Thunderdome this Saturday, Feb. 20 versus UC Davis, which is set for a 7 p.m. tip-off time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/","id":344,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[343,342,341],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"As Big West Tourney Nears, UCSB Looking for Wins Against CSUN and LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Beginning the UCSB women's basketball team's three-game home stretch is its matchups versus Cal State Northridge tonight and Long Beach on Saturday.

After splitting their pair of games last week with an 80-62 win over UCI and a 60-52 loss to Long Beach State, the Gauchos prepare for rematches versus Cal State Northridge tonight and LBSU on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Chasing UCSB are the Matadors in sixth-place at 6-18, 4-6 in the Big West. They were defeated by UCSB 65-49 in the first meeting between the two teams two weeks ago. The 49ers managed to redeem their first road loss of the conference season at Hawaii, which ended their five-game winning streak, with their victory over UCSB last weekend. LBSU ranks fourth in the Big West with an 18-6 overall and 7-3 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a 2-12 start in its non-conference schedule, it seemed like the reigning conference tournament champions were destined for a first-round exit in the postseason. Although the Matadors remain below the .500 mark in Big West play, they could be the ‘cinderella’ story of this year’s tournament in March.</p>\n<p>Central to CSUN’s improvements in the second half of the season has been the emergence of freshman center Channon Fluker. After starting in just one game during the non-conference portion of the season averaging 6.6 points per game and 6.5 rebounds per game, Fluker has been one of the most dominant post players since the start of the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Recently, Fluker has recorded seven consecutive double-doubles and is averaging 20.8 points and 13.9 rebounds per game. Through 10 Big West games, she has led CSUN with 16.7 ppg and 12.4 rebounds per game. Both conference averages lead the Big West thus far.</p>\n<p>She didn’t start in the Matadors’ first meeting against the Gauchos, and finished with eight points on 3-8 shooting and a game-high 15 rebounds in 26 minutes of play. While the addition of Fluker to the team’s starting lineup may make a difference, the Matadors hope to avoid another inefficient shooting night. Overall, CSUN shot 19-53 (35.8 percent) and 3-13 (23.1 percent) from beyond the arc in the Feb. 3 meeting.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, it was a phenomenal shooting night for the Gauchos, posting their third best three-point shooting performance of the season at 42.9 percent. Nonetheless, Santa Barbara notched a 45.8 field goal percentage to complement its long-range shooting.</p>\n<p>Contributing to the Gauchos’ fluent shooting from behind the perimeter and from other areas of the court was senior guard Jasmine Ware. Although she attempted just one shot from deep, she registered a game-high 17 points on an 8-11 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will attempt to recover its tremendous three-point shooting after an 18.2 field goal percentage from beyond the arc last Saturday at LBSU. However, ensuring that it contains Fluker will be the Gauchos’ main priority entering tonight.</p>\n<p>Continuing UCSB’s home stand is its rematch versus Long Beach State Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will seek to rally back from its worst shooting night from the field (28.8 percent) and from behind the three-point line (18.2 percent) in a conference game this season in its loss to the 49ers. Once again, UCSB will have to endure Long Beach State’s stout defense which leads the Big West and ranks 13<sup>th</sup> in the nation with 21.3 turnovers forced per game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB forced 21 turnovers last Saturday, it allowed Long Beach State to capitalize on points off turnovers at a greater pace of 25-17 in which the Gauchos turned the ball over 18 times. After netting a career-high 20 points, four assists and four steals in the team’s win over UCI, junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe was responsible for six of UCSB’s 18 turnovers against LBSU.</p>\n<p>Benefitting from the 49ers’ advantage in points off turnovers were junior forward Madison Montgomery and junior guard Raven Benton. Both finished with 15 points and were precise with their shot selection. Montgomery shot 7-11 from the field, while Benton went 5-6 to go along with three steals.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to possibly defeat LBSU, not only will it need to reduce its amount of turnovers, but it will need more production from its bench. The Gauchos were outscored 24-13 in bench points while Roper was the only player on the team to notch double-figures in scoring with 16 points on a rough 4-14 shooting afternoon.

Starting at 9:30 a.m., the Gauchos will take on No. 25 Texas A&amp;M and No. 4 LSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently 4-1, Texas A&amp;M finished with a solid overall record of 40-20 last season. Returning to its batting lineup are several players who hit over .300 last year. Sophomore infielder Tori Vidales holds the team’s second highest batting average at a .417 clip and is fresh off a team-high 51 runs scored in 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Texas A&amp;M possesses a respectable offense, its pitching rotation has weakened with the loss of senior pitcher Rachel Fox, who totaled a team-high 182 strikeouts and a 23-14 record in her final season. The Gauchos will look to capitalize against the Aggies’ youth in pitching, which only has one senior in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LSU comes into the tournament with a record of 4-1. After suffering its only loss against Pacific, LSU exploded for a 10-1 victory over Pacific in a rematch the next day. Guiding the Tigers’ redemptive win were two of their best hitters in junior outfielder Bailey Landry and senior infielder Bianka Bell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bell helped to bring in four runs while Landry recorded two hits and an RBI in the win. Both currently own batting averages above .400, providing the Gauchos’ pitching rotation with </span></p>\n<p>UCSB will finish its tournament playing host team Bethune-Cookman on Sunday.  With a respectable 3-2 record after its opening weekend, Bethune-Cookman received honors for two of its prized rookie players.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman pitcher Deidra Genera was named the league’s pitcher of the week, while freshman infielder Brianna Sanders picked up rookie of the week. With young players having such an immediate impact, Bethune-Cookman is a team the Gauchos cannot overlook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has a challenging series of games in this weekend’s Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic. However, Head Coach Brie Galicinao knows exactly what her team needs to do to successfully approach them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to take care of the little things on defense and pitching and continue to score big on offense. If the team continues to hit and score every game while our defense and pitching irons out some things, we’ll be in every single game,” Galicinao said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Gauchos taking on such strong lineups this weekend, the pitching staff will be feeling the heat, but the Gauchos’ defense will come ready to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With disciplined power hitters, we just have to be smart about our pitching call strategy and knowing how to best challenge hitters,” Galicinao explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After facing just one ranked opponent last weekend in No. 9 Arizona, UCSB will face its most difficult set of games as it will face three nationally ranked teams this weekend: No. 4 LSU, No. 11 Washington and No. 25 Texas A&amp;M. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game action will start against the Binghamton Bearcats this Friday, Feb. 19 at 12:30 p.m. The Gauchos will face Washington later that day at 3 p.m. Its Saturday doubleheader on Feb. 20 will begin at 9:30 a.m. against Texas A&amp;M and LSU at 3 p.m. Ending UCSB’s weekend will be its game against Bethune-Cookman at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 21. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stanford, 8-2 MPSF, 10-2 overall, are at the top of the standings, tied with UCLA and Long Beach State.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This is a huge week for us going on the road against two very good teams,” said redshirt junior libero Parker Boehle. “We haven’t played them this year, but we are going to prepare the same way as every game, and hopefully come away with two much needed wins.”</p>\n<p>Boehle has had a solid season thus far, and is averaging 1.65 digs per set, good enough for second on the team behind senior setter Jonah Seif who averages 1.80.</p>\n<p>The two games this week mark the beginning of the toughest part of the Gauchos’ schedule, with all but one of their remaining games coming against ranked opponents. The MPSF has seven teams in the top 10, including numbers one through five, so UCSB needs to grab as many matches as they can before playoffs begin.</p>\n<p>“These games are huge for our standing because Stanford and Pepperdine are both ahead of us in the MPSF standings,” Boehle said. “One of our goals is to host a first round playoff game, so beating these two teams on the road would be huge.”</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, UCSB lost three straight, but reversed their fortunes at home against UCI, 25-17, 26-24, 25-17; and UCSD, 25-20, 25-22, 25-14. The players are hoping that the team’s resilient wins bring a spark heading into the Pepperdine match.</p>\n<p>“It felt great to be back in our home gym and to start winning again,” Boehle said. “We were very disappointed with the way we played in BYU, but it was great to see us bounce back and hopefully start another winning streak.”</p>\n<p>Much of UCSB’s success in the wins over Irvine and San Diego rested on the performances of a couple of the team’s veterans, including redshirt senior middle blocker Ryan Hardy and redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh.</p>\n<p>“[They’ve] been guys we can rely on to put a ball away at any given moment,” Boehle said. “Being the older guys on our team, they have really stepped up and carried us through a couple games lately.”</p>\n<p>Marsh, however has been the breakout performer of the year for UCSB, as the opposite leads the team with 3.55 kills per set. Against UCSD, he also tallied his fourth 15-kill match on the season, after redshirting last year due to injury.</p>\n<p>Hardy is known for his contributions on both sides of the floor, averaging 1.18 blocks per set, second best on the team, including three solo blocks. On offense he offers 1.66 kills per set with a 4.88 hitting percentage, the most efficient among UCSB starters. Against Pepperdine and Stanford, the Gauchos will hope they can get the best out their stars as they push on in conference play.</p>\n<p>“I think we are in a good spot, in spite of losing more game than we think we should have to this point,” Boehle said. “We have been on the road quite a bit and are still above .500, so I think we are going to be a tough team to beat.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play at Pepperdine on Wednesday at 7 p.m., and then continue on the road at Stanford on Friday at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/no-10-ucsb-faces-pepperdine-stanford-in-pair-of-top-ten-clashes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/no-10-ucsb-faces-pepperdine-stanford-in-pair-of-top-ten-clashes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/no-10-ucsb-faces-pepperdine-stanford-in-pair-of-top-ten-clashes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/no-10-ucsb-faces-pepperdine-stanford-in-pair-of-top-ten-clashes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/no-10-ucsb-faces-pepperdine-stanford-in-pair-of-top-ten-clashes/","id":5062,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5061,5060,5059],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 10 Gauchos Shake Three-Match Slump, Sweep No. 11 UCI & UCSD","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"On a three-match skid entering its two matchups versus No. 11 UC Irvine and UC San Diego, the No. 10 UCSB men's volleyball team prevailed with straight-set victories over the Anteaters and Tritons.

After last week’s games, Irvine dropped to 3-7 in MPSF play, 4-8 overall. San Diego remained winless in conference play, now sitting at 0-10 in the MPSF and 3-11 overall.</p>\n<p>Leading up to the Irvine match last Wednesday, UCSB had lost its last three matches and were looking to end its rough stretch with its pair of home games. Adding to their motivation, the Gauchos only other conference loss aside from their latest three-game losing streak came in their MPSF opener at Irvine.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It wasn’t the team that I wanted to beat. They had a few starters that were out, but we came in and took care of business, followed the scouting report, and it ended in a win,” redshirt senior middle blocker Ryan Hardy said.</p>\n<p>Hardy tallied six kills and four block assists, helping his team to a 25-17, 26-24, 25-17 win over its MPSF counterpart. Redshirt senior outside hitter Austin Kingi led the charge for the Gauchos with 10 kills and five digs, both team-highs on the night.</p>\n<p>Irvine played without junior opposite Tamir Hershko, who is leading the team in kills and averaging an astounding 4.07 kills per set. The Gauchos took advantage of the Anteaters’ missing star, out blocking the visitors 18-4 and holding the injury-depleted Irvine squad to a .081 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Friday, UCSB hosted UCSD, who currently sits in last of the MPSF standings, and the match didn’t start how the Gauchos had planned.</p>\n<p>In the first set, the Tritons jumped out to a surprising 15-12 lead, and in the second they led 17-13 at one point. In both sets, however, the Gauchos came back from the deficits behind redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh’s 15-kill night. Senior setter Jonah Seif handed in a usually steady performance with a team-high 35 assists and four kills.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the times we come in and we take teams for granted or take them lightly. The energy was low but we recognized that and fixed it in the third set and took care of business.”</p>\n<p>With the game all but won late in the third, Head Coach Rick McLaughlin mixed up the lineup, giving all of the bench players a chance to close out the match. The coach used all 14 of his active players on the night, using the chance to give playing time to some of the less-experienced players.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was stoked,” Hardy said. “Those guys work hard every single day and they’re all itching for a chance to play so any time we can get them on the court, it’s worth it to see their faces out there.”</p>\n<p>“We feel good but we’re definitely not done. We still have some climbing to do and a lot to work to be the best team come playoff time.”</p>\n<p>This week, the Gauchos travel to Malibu for a Wednesday meeting with No. 9 Pepperdine at 7 p.m. at the Firestone Fieldhouse. Friday, UCSB heads north to play No. 4 Stanford at Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68286\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-16/no-10-gauchos-shake-three-match-slump-sweep-no-11-uci-ucsd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68286\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-16/no-10-gauchos-shake-three-match-slump-sweep-no-11-uci-ucsd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-16/no-10-gauchos-shake-three-match-slump-sweep-no-11-uci-ucsd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-16/no-10-gauchos-shake-three-match-slump-sweep-no-11-uci-ucsd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-16/no-10-gauchos-shake-three-match-slump-sweep-no-11-uci-ucsd/","id":5045,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5044,5043,5042],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":87,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
