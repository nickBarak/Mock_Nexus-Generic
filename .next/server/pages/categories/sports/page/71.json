UCSB acted quickly in the first half and put a goal up on the board only 1:37 into the game. The shot was set up by a corner kick from sophomore midfielder Madeline Gibson, who crossed it to the feet of junior forward Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>Ball, able to control the cross, then passed it to junior midfielder Kate Shoemaker, who finished the play with an easy tap to the net. The goal was Shoemaker’s first this season.</p>\n<p>While UCSB was able to keep the count at 1-0 up until halftime, Hawaii saw multiple opportunities to score. About 40 minutes into the first half, Hawaii junior forward Sonest Furtado beat the Gaucho defense and went one-on-one with senior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia. Fortunately, Furtado’s shot went wide, just left of the goal.</p>\n<p>Upon overcoming that close call in the last few minutes of the first half, the Gauchos used the halftime break to settle down and regroup. A little over 10 minutes into the second half, UCSB made it 2-0 when a foul was called on the Rainbow Wahine in the box, giving the Gauchos an indirect free kick from 14 yards out.</p>\n<p>The free kick was taken by senior midfielder Dakota Griggs, who made the assist to sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin for the second Gaucho goal of the game.</p>\n<p>The latter segment of the second half took a turn for the worse as UCSB allowed two Hawaii goals. The first was from a corner kick by sophomore midfielder Raisa Strom-Okimoto, who crossed it toward the far post to the feet of freshman forward Tia Furuta.</p>\n<p>Remaining patient, the Rainbow Wahine put together yet another goal just 15 minutes later in the 84th minute when Furuta connected a pass to a run by senior forward Addie Steiner, who penetrated the Gaucho defense to put the score at 2-2.</p>\n<p>Unsatisfied with the score, sophomore midfielder Mallory Hromatko took charge for her team and powered toward the left side of the field to make a sharp pass to the center just yards in front of the goal box to Shoemaker, who was able to control the dart of a pass, and finish the play with an accurate shot on goal to score the game-winner.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ cohesive teamwork against Hawaii was impressive, and will have to be on display in every conference game this season. While the Gauchos saw a few close calls that could have cost them the game, their ability to regroup and slow down the tempo of the game gave them an advantage.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos can continue to play at the same speed and with the same mindset, any team will have a hard time getting through.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to extend their winning streak next Thursday when they take on Cal State Northridge in Harder Stadium at 5:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gauchos-collect-win-in-big-west-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gauchos-collect-win-in-big-west-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gauchos-collect-win-in-big-west-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gauchos-collect-win-in-big-west-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gauchos-collect-win-in-big-west-opener/","id":1455,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1454,1453,1452],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Drought vs. Golden Bears Continues, Lose 13-9","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Water-Polo-v-Pepperdine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Water-Polo-v-Pepperdine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Searching for its first victory against Cal since 2004, the No. 7 UCSB men's water polo team was unable to overcome the No. 2 Golden Bears potency on offense.

However, Santa Barbara fought its way back with a great second half effort that came up just short, leading to its fourth loss.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The No. 2 team in the country got off to a quick start in the first quarter, taking a 3-0 lead before Jovanovic delivered the first goal for UCSB and made the score 3-1 at the end of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>In the second frame the Golden Bears took complete control, scoring six goals while their goalkeeper Lazar Andric limited the Gauchos to one goal to take a 9-2 lead into the half.</p>\n<p>Instead of giving up, UCSB put up a valiant effort in the third as Jovanovic’s two goals and goals by three different players cut into the huge Cal lead. The Golden Bears were able to put up two more tallies before the end of the third, making the score 11-7 headed into the fourth.</p>\n<p>In the final frame Santa Barbara tried its best to continue the fast-paced play to win the match; however, it just had too much ground to make up and not enough time, which led to its 13-9 loss.</p>\n<p>For most of the fourth, UCSB’s freshman goalkeeper Justyn Barrios limited Cal to just one goal, keeping his team in the game, but towards the end of the match Cal pushed a final insurance goal through, sealing the win.</p>\n<p>Barrios split time in the cage with senior Liam Lenihan, who played the entire first half. Both goalkeepers had four saves in the game, but Lenihan allowed nine goals in the first half while Barrios limited the home team to only four goals throughout the entire second half.</p>\n<p>This season, the argument could be made that the freshman has made a bigger impact while in the cage for UCSBthan has his older counterpart; however, it seems as though a decision has yet to be made as to the team’s starting goalkeeper. Lenihan has certainly played well, but has struggled in his last few matches.</p>\n<p>Conference play begins this week for the Gauchos and all eyes will be on how impactful their move to the new Golden Coast Conference will be. Despite losing to Cal for yet another year, UCSB certainly played well, and if it can build off that, who’s to say the two teams can’t meet in the NCAA Championships with Santa Barbara finally scoring that sweet victory?</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next match kicks off conference play against Pepperdine on Thursday, Oct. 6 at 6:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Our goal is to win every game—I think it’s a realistic goal—but we have to play together to get the results.”</p>\n<p>The New Zealand native has quickly grown into his new starting role this year, tied for third on the team with two goals to go with an assist as well.</p>\n<p>However, the Titans managed to respond with an equalizer in the 27th minute as freshman forward Rei Dorwart provided the assist picking up a through ball and beat the Gaucho defense to the end line. His cutback pass found teammate sophomore midfielder Ross McPhie in the center of the box, who scored the team’s goal past Santa Barbara’s freshman keeper Titouan Le Roux.</p>\n<p>Le Roux had a relatively quiet night otherwise as he and the Gaucho defense held Fullerton to just four shots on goal for the night. To tinker with his back line that had been visibly struggling throughout the losing streak, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg opted to start All-American senior striker Nick DePuy at right center-back.</p>\n<p>DePuy did the job that was needed, helping the Gauchos keep CSUF under wraps for the entire second half as the teams battled back and forth in the midfield. Despite being outshot 8-7, the Titans were just as tidy in the back field area. Their allowance of eight shots were the fewest Santa Barbara has recorded in its last six matches.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless second half, the teams headed into overtime. It was the third consecutive match in which the Gauchos played in an OT period, fourth time in their last five games.</p>\n<p>Just 1:19 into the extra period, Feucht headed home his eighth goal of the season for the golden goal winner.</p>\n<p>The chance came when senior midfielder Andy Perez found assist-leader and senior midfielder Josue España. After a few short passes on the wing, the España hit a first-time cross to the back post. Junior forward Ahinga Selemani just missed the first header, but Feucht was waiting behind him to finish it off to score for the sixth straight match.</p>\n<p>“We were really excited to get the win,” said Billingsley. “We’ve gone to extra time four or five times now, so once we were able to string a couple of good plays and win on Kevin’s goal, we all went crazy.”</p>\n<p>The Germany native is becoming one of the best players in the nation, with his eight goals likely to end up putting him in the top-ten scorers after the weekend’s matches. Nonetheless, he continues to affect the game defensively as he continues to break forward on the quick counter attacks that have helped contribute to the Gauchos’ opportunities on the offensive side this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to build on their recent win as conference play continues with a chance to avenge their three-loss home stand two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>“Losing that many in a row is never good for a team, but doing it at home, we feel like we owe it to a lot of people to get a few wins this week,” Billingsley said.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is UC Irvine this Thursday, Oct. 6 at 7: 30 p.m. at Anteater Stadium. Santa Barbara will be playing in its final road match before preparing for another three-game home stand at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72788\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/feuchts-golden-goal-gives-gauchos-first-conf-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72788\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/feuchts-golden-goal-gives-gauchos-first-conf-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/feuchts-golden-goal-gives-gauchos-first-conf-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/feuchts-golden-goal-gives-gauchos-first-conf-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/feuchts-golden-goal-gives-gauchos-first-conf-win/","id":1440,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1439,1438,1437],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End With Stalemate in Conf.

After the break it was more Highlanders, and in the 66th minute, they found the goal that looked to have guaranteed them the win against the visiting Gauchos when Lomeli played teammate senior forward Tyler Miguel in for his first goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, though, the Gauchos responded with authority. Junior defender Randy Mendoza played senior midfielder Josue España down the left wing, who whipped his cross into the imposing DePuy in the middle before the striker headed past the UCR goalkeeper to bring the score up to 2-1. It was DePuy’s fifth goal of the season and the in-form frontman has now scored in his last three matches.</p>\n<p>“I think the offense has been playing really well, especially at this point in the season; we’re getting a lot of chances and scoring a lot of goals,” DePuy said. “It’s great getting all the service I’ve been getting, and if the crosses keep coming, I’m sure I’ll get on the end of one or two of them.”</p>\n<p>España has quietly turned into one of the most important players for UCSB with a team-high five assists, linking up with Feucht in the midfield to great success. Along with DePuy, the trio has the potential to lead their side to the top of the table as some of the best players in conference; DePuy and Feucht were the two Gauchos to make the Big West All-Conference First Team last season.</p>\n<p>Feucht has possibly been the best player in the conference up to this point, starting all 10 games and registering a Big West-high seven goals (13th in the nation) and 16 points. The German has been instrumental in everything the team does going forward, breaking up the field to support DePuy and the wingers to great success.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is another away game Saturday against CSU Fullerton as Big West play continues, and the players are confident they’ll be able to build off the Riverside draw to get back into the win column.</p>\n<p>“We need to step it up a little more in the back; whether that’s more leadership, more communication or just shutting guys down better, we have to limit our mistakes,” said DePuy. “I think the tie was a boost for our team going into this game. We’re not gonna quit and we’re gonna keep working hard, so I think the team feels really good coming into Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>The match will be played tonight at 7 p.m. at CSU Fullerton. An audio stream for the game will be available on the schedule page of the men’s soccer team <em>ucsbgauchos.com </em>website and @thenexus_sports will be live tweeting the match.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-30/gauchos-reach-stalemate-in-conf-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-30/gauchos-reach-stalemate-in-conf-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-30/gauchos-reach-stalemate-in-conf-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-30/gauchos-reach-stalemate-in-conf-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-30/gauchos-reach-stalemate-in-conf-opener/","id":1438,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1437,1436,1435],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Hall of Fame Nominees Announced; Top 3 RBs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After the recent release of the NFL Hall of Fame's Class of 2017 nominations, Sports Editor Sean White keys in on the running back position specifically and forms a Top 3 list of ball carriers that sh...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the last few years of NFL football, we have watched the depreciation of the running back position.

One player in particular who is expected to be a challenge for Santa Barbara is Hawaii sophomore midfielder Raisa Strom-Okimoto. Having already contributed four goals and five assists this season, Okimoto will be eager to find ways to penetrate the UCSB defense.</p>\n<p>Hawaii senior forward Addie Steiner also has an impressive four goals scored this season while contributing one assist. Thus far, it’s inevitable when placing both Steiner and Okimoto up front that the two make for a powerful team. Defense will have to be played well at every position for the Gauchos if they are to contain the duo early.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are also known for a strong front line, their defense has emerged as a huge factor in the team’s success this season.</p>\n<p>“We feel that defense has been very important to our success. It has been a full team effort in this area; specifically, our forwards and attacking mids have been very selfless in their effort on the defensive side of the ball,” Stumpf said. “Other than that, our back six have been very organized with our zonal defending.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos’ defense has helped produce with contributions on offense. Senior defender Savannah Francis has contributed one goal so far this season along with three assists.</p>\n<p>In addition, senior defender Kailey Hackett has executed two clutch assists as well. Sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers continues to be a safety net for UCSB as she has a total of 25 saves this season to complement five wins.</p>\n<p>However, no one plays better offense for the Gauchos than standout junior forward Amanda Ball. Ball has been working the field all season, scoring a team-high eight goals and has tallied one assist this season. Ball and freshman forward Shaelan Murison each have a hat trick on the year.</p>\n<p>Tailing Ball in goals scored is sophomore forward Mallory Hromatko. The 2015 Big West Freshman of the Year award winner has netted four goals this season to go along with one assist. Sophomore midfielder Maddie Gibson leads the team in assists, having been the playmaker behind a total of four goals so far this season.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB has scored a total of 22 goals and recorded 20 assists. Although the Gauchos statistics are greater than the Rainbow Wahine’s, it’s all about endurance, execution and attitude when the whistle blows on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I think we are feeling confident but remaining grateful and hungry for more,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the University of Hawaii this Sunday, Oct. 2 at 2 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 29, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72671\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-enter-conference-play-as-best-in-big-west-open-vs-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72671\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-enter-conference-play-as-best-in-big-west-open-vs-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-enter-conference-play-as-best-in-big-west-open-vs-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-enter-conference-play-as-best-in-big-west-open-vs-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-enter-conference-play-as-best-in-big-west-open-vs-hawaii/","id":1437,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1436,1435,1434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope Big West Opener Means End to Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MSoccervsCal_924_JennyLuo-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MSoccervsCal_924_JennyLuo-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After five straight non-conference losses, UCSB hopes to begin the conference schedule the right way with a win at UC Riverside.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After going 0-3 in last week’s home stand, the UCSB men’s soccer team travels south to UC Riverside for the opening match of its conference season.

The Santa Barbara offense has been solid all year, averaging 1.89 goals per game, but their recent struggles in the back have come at a cost.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg was very vocal about the number of poor mistakes in the back, however, and what it has done to throw away several leads in the last couple games. In their current losing streak, UCSB has been outscored 15-8 and have allowed 1.96 goals on the season. Freshman goalkeeper Titouan Le Roux has 37 saves this year, the third highest of Big West keepers while playing every minute for the Gauchos, but the defense as a unit has been lacking.</p>\n<p>“Goals happen from mistakes, and in soccer especially one goal can lose you the game,” said junior midfielder Kevin Feucht. “It’s kind of mentally unlucky in the last 20 minutes when we let in that one goal at the end of the game when we actually can win it.”</p>\n<p>Junior midfielder Kevin Feucht has been the brightest spot in the highly talented team, scoring a Big West-high six goals and 14 points in his box-to-box role. The German has scored from the penalty spot, the run of play and a couple headers, along with all of the defensive work he is responsible for in the middle.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to say I’ve been lucky because luck comes from hard work,” Feucht said. “In an average game I run eight or nine miles so I put work on the field, and I’ve been lucky getting goals and just trying to help the team.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho midfield has looked good going forward in general, with wingers supplying plenty of crosses for the target man DePuy. Senior Josue España leads the team with four assists, and UCSB has had a credited assist on all 17 goals this season, many thanks to Feucht and España’s distribution.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will be eagerly waiting for the return of freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, as he recovers from a groin injury suffered in his star performance in the UCLA loss. The Ghanian played in all seven matches and was quickly becoming a solid holding presence in the center of the park. Amo will surely slot right back in as soon as he is match fit again.</p>\n<p>In a press conference after the Loyola Marymount loss, Vom Steeg expressed his belief in the possibility of the Gauchos going undefeated in conference play if they become more clinical, and the team has shown for long parts of games that they can control the pace of the match.</p>\n<p>“I think there is better improvement from losing a game than by winning because you look at mistakes made, and you stand up and become a better team,” Feucht said. “The goal for conference is, obviously, to win every game and win a championship. We want to win the conference and get a seed at Nationals and show our talent around the country.”</p>\n<p>Feucht and co. have the chance to regroup and get their season back on track when the Gauchos travel to UC Riverside Soccer Stadium Thursday night at 7 p.m. A live audio stream is available on the schedule page of the men’s soccer<em><a href=\"http://ucsbgauchos.com/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://ucsbgauchos.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475284298260000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsYm_oraUSECrnxCXGNbxCMCOm2g\">UCSBgauchos.com</a></em> website.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72720\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-hope-big-west-opener-means-end-to-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72720\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-hope-big-west-opener-means-end-to-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-hope-big-west-opener-means-end-to-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-hope-big-west-opener-means-end-to-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/gauchos-hope-big-west-opener-means-end-to-losing-streak/","id":1439,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1438,1437,1436],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 7 Gauchos Head to Cal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FILEPHOTO-Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_005-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FILEPHOTO-Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_005-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A Saturday rematch that will present the No. 7 UCSB men's water polo team with the opportunity to defeat Cal for the first time since 2004, much anticipation has surfaced as the Gauchos prepare to fac...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a 2-2 outing and seventh place finish at last weekend’s Mountain Pacific Invitational, the No. 7 UCSB men’s water polo team will remain in Berkley to face No. 2 Cal for a Saturday rematch.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has the opportunity to pull off a tremendous upset, having not defeated Cal since a 7-6 double overtime victory on Oct. 17, 2004.

The Golden Bears will look to improve upon their 11-1 record.</p>\n<p>However, for UCSB, overcoming its 12-year winning drought vs. Cal will be no easy feat. In what will be the only regular season matchup between the two programs this year, the anticipation surrounding the Gaucho-Golden Bear showdown has certainly increased after meeting each other a total of four times last season.</p>\n<p>Entering Saturday with an advantage will be Cal as it won each of the four matches.</p>\n<p>Despite already experiencing a loss to the Golden Bears last Saturday, the Gauchos remain confident in their capabilities to overcome their hump but know they must sustain consistency against Cal’s ongoing attack.</p>\n<p>“[Last Saturday it was] 9-8 in the third quarter. [We] gave up a couple of sloppy goals,” Asssitant Coach Ryan McMillen said. “It’s a four quarter game. We had three good quarters, [so] we’re working towards having four solid quarters on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos’ potential to upset the Golden Bears remains probable behind the recent play of senior utility Reed Cotterill. A transfer from Golden West College, Cotterill is emerging as one of Santa Barbara’s top players after playing in 28 games, scoring 25 goals and tallying seven assists in his first season at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Cotterill leads the Gauchos in scoring with 15 goals and recently helped Santa Barbara get back on a winning track with a hat trick performance against No. 14 Princeton last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Aiding Cotterill has been the play of junior attacker Shane Hauschild. A Santa Barbara native, Hauschild finds himself second on the team in goals with 14 and is the team’s leader in shots and assists.</p>\n<p>While much time remains on the Gauchos’ schedule to develop as a team, Hauschild understands his role when in the pool and is looking to establish himself more as a team leader.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a new role for me this year,” Hauschild said. “In my first two years I scored a lot because I was the young kid that other teams thought they could leave me and let me try to beat them by myself. This year, me and Reed are getting more of that attention because we’re the older players. [Teams] kind of know who we are are so that’s opening things up for a lot of other guys on our team. I think this year will be a lot more balance scoring wise between everyone as opposed to one or two guys having way more goals than everyone else.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB will hope to establish balance on offense, it will need to ensure it does the same on defense as it prepares to face one of the nation’s best players.</p>\n<p>A pivotal asset within the Golden Bears’ success over the Gauchos all last season and currently having a strong 2016 campaign thus far is sophomore attacker Johnny Hooper.</p>\n<p>Building off an excellent freshman year in which he was crowned the 2015 MPSF Newcomer of the Year, Hooper’s current team-high of 37 goals ranks atop the conference in scoring along with his league-leading 3.08 goals per game.</p>\n<p>While Hooper serves as the Golden Bears primary attacker on offense, Cal possesses an arsenal of scorers that can emerge during any period of the game. Overall, the Golden Bears offense has accumulated a conference-high 192 team goals in 12 games played and lead the MPSF with 16.0 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Even without Hooper included, six other Golden Bears have recorded double-digit goal totals. Following Hooper’s team-high at 15 goals apiece are redshirt freshman Jordan Hoover and true freshman Safak Simsek.</p>\n<p>Set to face one of the most lethal offenses in the nation, it’s inevitable that the Gauchos’ defense will be tested. Cal is one of three teams this season that has reached UCSB’s season-high of 15 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>While no team can truly put the Golden Bears’ offense to a halt, Santa Barbara did return to the drawing board in pursuit of different results come Saturday. But it may take more than a week’s worth of practice for the Gauchos to reach their final form as a team as they have been doing double the work out of the pool.</p>\n<p>“It’s early in the seaosn for us,” McMillen said. “We just got done with our hell month. Most other school weren’t going through that, they were through two hard weeks. We were going eight hours a day for the first four weeks with a day off each week. Now school just started, we’ve done a little bit of a taper and we’re only going about two and a half hours a day.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal’s matchup will begin at noon this Saturday, Oct. 1, at Spieker Aquatics Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 29, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy

The obvious one, to those native to the crescent city and even to those who aren’t, is the day Hurricane Katrina struck the city on Aug. 23, 2005, and completely destroyed people’s homes, families, livelihoods, and hope.</p>\n<p>Due to the devastating hit the city took from Katrina, about 9,000 people took shelter in the New Orleans Superdome, home to the Saints, who had evacuated beforehand. A place once home to one of the worst franchises in all of sports now became home to people who had been through one of the worst catastrophes imaginable. Even worse, the lack of supplies was so bad many people were left starving and thirsty.</p>\n<p>The state of the Superdome became extremely bad over the next few days due to the breakdown of hygiene, urinals, and plumbing, which left the smell inside the stadium horrible. The outside also went bad as the roof was peeling off and holes were starting to form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Due to the state of the Superdome and the severity of the situation, the 2005 Saints played no home games in the dome and played in Baton Rouge Stadium or the Alamodome. Worst of all, their home opener was rescheduled to a Monday night “home” game against the Giants at The Meadowlands, home of the New York Giants. That’s right: The Saints’ “home opener” was scheduled to be played at their opponents’ home stadium, and there was nothing they could do about it.</p>\n<p>As the 2005 season went on there were various reports that the owner, Tom Benson, and government officials in San Antonio were working behind the scenes concerning a possible permanent relocation for the Saints to San Antonio. The reports said Benson would get out of his contract by saying the Superdome was no longer adequate to house his team.</p>\n<p>Fans were stunned. By this point they were just trying to get back into a normal lifestyle, and now the team they loved was being taken away from them. Make no mistake; although the Saints were a terrible team for many, many years, they were still loved by the city of New Orleans.</p>\n<p>Many fans in Louisiana were angered and felt people in San Antonio were taking advantage of an already desolated city by stealing their franchise. Tensions ran so high that the New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin called Benson’s actions shameful to those who supported the team through about 40 losing seasons.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, once all was said and done, the NFL stated that the Saints would stay in New Orleans and the Superdome would re-open its doors on Sept. 25, 2006, for a Monday night game against the Falcons. Fans were so happy to hear the Saints were staying, that for the first time in franchise history the team sold its entire home schedule to season ticket holders.</p>\n<p>That’s where our second day comes in. The day most embedded into New Orleans culture, whether you are a sports fan or not. The day the crescent city was reborn.</p>\n<p>Very rarely will there be another play that touches the hearts of people not even part of the sports world as much as the blocked punt by Steve Gleason, which was returned for a touchdown after a Falcons three-and-out on their opening drive, now dubbed “Rebirth.” To this day, people swear the Superdome was never as loud as during and after that magical play.</p>\n<p>Those who doubt the importance of one play, especially one such as this, truly do not know the electricity that flowed through the city and their football team thanks to Rebirth. The Saints crushed the Falcons 23-3 that night and went on to have their best season in franchise history, finishing 10-6, clinching a first round bye and reaching their first ever NFC championship game.</p>\n<p>While the Saints’ season in 2006 did not end with a Super Bowl championship, the pieces were set to make a run and eventually win the most coveted game. By comparison, New Orleans as a city was also recovering steadily, but it wasn’t ready to say it was fully back to normal only one year after such a horrible tragedy.</p>\n<p>See, the thing about the Saints and their ties with their city is that as the football team started to become a winner, the crescent city was recovering. It was almost as though the city was lifted through the success of the Saints, which all came to fruition in 2009 when New Orleans was able to see their once loveable losers become champions of the football world.</p>\n<p>Rebirth wasn’t just about a single play in which an athlete made a solid effort. It was not about the players, it was not about the football team and it certainly was not about the touchdown.</p>\n<p>It was about the city coming together and putting its love into a team that was never respected. It was about the beginning of the reshaping that took place as the city moved on from Katrina and the Saints moved on from their horrible past. Both parties were ready to become winners, and now they are.</p>\n<p>When the Saints and Falcons re-took the field 10 years later this past Monday to celebrate the historic event, it really felt like everything had come full circle. Sure, the Saints are not a top team anymore, and, unfortunately, they did lose this past Monday 45-32, but the journey from that night and blocked punt in 2006 until now was truly a spectacle worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>Katrina was one of the worst things that could happen to any city anywhere in the world. It robbed people of many valuable things. But what the Saints and the citizens of New Orleans were able to embody is the ultimate form of resiliency. That’s what makes Rebirth not only special, but certainly worthy of the title given to that blocked punt on that night and worthy of the statue made in its honor.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In addition to leading the conference in goals (15), total points (31) and shots (80), DePuy was best in the clutch as he led both the nation and conference with eight game-winning goals and is currently third all-time in Big West history with 14 career game-winners. The Gauchos’ sharpshooter also tied for third in the nation in scoring with 15 goals. Becoming the first player in Big West history to earn three straight Big West Offensive Player of the Week awards this season, DePuy’s impact on the field is inevitable as Santa Barbara is 16-0-4 all-time when the forward scores a goal.

Substitute winger Dalton Pando found space on the left and lobbed it up to the far post, where the 6’5” striker Nick DePuy rose above the defenders to head in his fourth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Yet another defensive lapse would cost the Gauchos’ their lead, though, when Le Roux’s short pass to a defender went behind its target and Cal intercepted, firing a quick pass through a hole in the middle and midfielder Nick Lima finished it off to equalize at two apiece. This was the third match in a row that the Gauchos allowed a game-tying or game-winning goal in the last five minutes of regulation, and their inability to close out the win cost them again in overtime.</p>\n<p>In extra time, Cal had far more energy, UCSB likely drained from conceding another crucial goal at the end of the first ninety minutes. The Golden Bears found plenty of space down the wing, then sent a ball across the six-yard box to Christian Thierjung, who tapped in the cutback pass with a tidy one-time finish.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was outshot 21-16, but kept the Bears under wraps for the first sixty minutes thanks to nine saves from Le Roux. Despite a career-high number of stops from the Frenchman, the Gauchos gave up three goals for the second straight match and for the third time during the losing streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s slide comes at a suboptimal time, with the Big West Conference season beginning Thursday with a trip to UC Riverside, but UCSB will be confident going into the league opener knowing they were able to finish last year 7-2-1, including a 2-0 home win versus the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>The Riverside match will be played Thursday at the UCR Soccer Stadium at 7 p.m. An audio stream will be available on the schedule page of the men’s soccer <a href=\"http://ucsbgauchos.com\">UCSBgauchos.com</a> website and the game.

Hawaii was not to be denied, however, and a burst of scoring gave them an 11-6 advantage that would prove insurmountable for the Gauchos, who couldn’t manage to cut the deficit under three for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Beginning a match-long trend, the Rainbow Wahine bested UCSB in hitting percentage .303 to .091 in the first frame. Remarkably, that was the lowest percentage Hawaii would hit for the entire match, as they improved above .400 for the next two sets.</p>\n<p>Hawaii provided another gut punch in the second set, as a dominant performance coupled with a sloppy UCSB showing (eight errors) led the Rainbow Wahine to their most decisive victory of the three games, 25-14.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s hitting percentage actually dropped to .000 while the Wahine jumped to .407, accurately portraying the chasm between the two teams’ second-set performances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to put forth a strong final set, however, finally raising their hitting percentage to a serviceable .241 and amassing double-digit kills (13).</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s vastly improved effort, the 14th-ranked Hawaii squad improved for the third consecutive game, playing a virtually perfect final set on their way to a 25-19 victory.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine boasted a hitting percentage of .448, committed only one error, and each time the Gauchos clawed their way back into contention, Hawaii was poised with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>This impressive Hawaii team refined its attack throughout the evening, asserting itself again as the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>They received important contributions from across the roster, with senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor, sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato, sophomore outside hitter Casey Castillo and reserve senior middle hitter Annie Mitchem leading the team’s offensive wave.</p>\n<p>Each of the four totaled at least seven kills, with Granato leading the pack with 13. Granato and her teammate Castillo hit a resounding .478 and .667 respectively, marking the efficiency with which the Wahine attacked the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>McKenna Granato also collected seven digs, second on the team to first-year setter Norene Iosia (8), adding to her solid all-around performance. Nikki Taylor had four assisted blocks to go along with one solo, further contributing to Hawaii’s stellar defense.</p>\n<p>Despite the disappointing output, several Gauchos still maintained a high level of play.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman amassed 10 kills, and despite her hitting percentage of .200, she was the only Gaucho with double-digit points in the match.</p>\n<p>Coach Lantagne Welch saw several positives throughout the evening that should help the team during the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>“Chloe Allen came off the bench, followed the game plan and went after it. She had success and that was a boost for us,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted of her first-year outside hitter.</p>\n<p>Allen has settled into her role off the bench, garnering the respect of her team and providing the Gauchos with verve in reserve heavy units.</p>\n<p>During the final game, Lantagne Welch was impressed with another first-year, middle blocker Rowan Ennis: “[She] got hot there for a stretch and helped us in the third set.” Ennis’ three kills in the set were vital in keeping the Gauchos within reach of a victory in the final game.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore and defensive specialist Sydney Bast also caught her coach’s eye, as she “helped stabilize [UCSB’s] passing,” while digging a team-high nine attacks.</p>\n<p>When Bast was asked after the game what about the Hawaii team had stumped the Gauchos, she noted, “they have a fast offense and we knew it coming into this game. We prepared for it all week, we just didn’t execute like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>She made sure to mention, though, the team’s consistently positive outlook: “It’s all good. We’re going to get them back at Hawaii.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look for its first conference win against Cal State Northridge on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/","id":5025,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5024,5023,5022],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Close Non-Conf.

Gaucho senior defender Kailey Hackett provided the assist, her second of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara extended its lead early in the second half when senior defender Savannah Francis took a pass from freshman forward Shaelan Murison, worked her way open at the top of the box and drilled a shot past Pacific goalie Melissa Ma for the third Gaucho goal.</p>\n<p>The 3-1 score held until the 82nd minute when Adam nailed a shot over the top of senior Gaucho goalie Jacq Cagina to make it 3-2.  The Gaucho defense stiffened the rest of the way, and Santa Barbara came away victorious again. With the loss, the Tigers continued their winless record dropping to 0-7-1 overall.</p>\n<p>The game featured another strong performance by the Gaucho defense. They allowed only four shots during the entire game, with three on goal. Cagina got the start and the win (3-0) for the Gauchos and tallied one save in the game. The Gaucho offensive attack featured eight shots on goal, led by Gibson with two.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s game, the Gauchos played to a 0-0 tie against the Loyola Marymount Lions in a double overtime thriller. Santa Barbara controlled the offensive flow of the game with ten shots on goal compared to only three for the Lions. The Gauchos also dominated on set pieces with 11 corner kick opportunities while Loyola had none.</p>\n<p>However, redshirt sophomore Loyola keeper Charlee Pruitt logged ten saves in the game to keep the Gauchos out of the net time and time again. Without a goal, Santa Barbara suffered its first shutout of the year.</p>\n<p>Of the ten Gaucho shots on goal, junior forward Amanda Ball, sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin, Gibson and Griggs each had two apiece. Gaucho sophomore keeper Brittney Rogers had three big saves in the game. Each team had eight fouls on the day.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s record now stands at 9-1-1 after the tie, while Loyola’s record goes to 5-2-3 after their third tie game of the season.  With the tie against Loyola in the books, the Gauchos will now enter into conference play with a game next Sunday, Oct. 2, at home against Hawaii. The match starts at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72598\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/gauchos-close-non-conf-schedule-split-pair-of-road-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72598\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/gauchos-close-non-conf-schedule-split-pair-of-road-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/gauchos-close-non-conf-schedule-split-pair-of-road-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/gauchos-close-non-conf-schedule-split-pair-of-road-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/gauchos-close-non-conf-schedule-split-pair-of-road-matches/","id":1436,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1435,1434,1433],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hoping to Redeem First Loss, Face LMU and Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite its chance of entering conference play with an undefeated record ending after collecting its first loss of the season at Texas, the UCSB women's soccer team will look to build momentum for its...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s soccer team got off to a phenomenal start for the 2016 season as it went 8-0 until the University of Texas put a stop to its undefeated streak by defeating the Gauchos 2-1 last Sunday.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Although the Gauchos are coming off their first loss of the season, they maintain their dominance, especially on the defensive end. The team’s defense has been dominant so far this season, allowing only four goals this year.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers had not been scored upon all year until the Texas – San Antonio game last Friday, and Santa Barbara’s streak of six straight shutouts tied the school record set in 1989.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s outstanding defensive line is led by senior Sydney Fuertes and junior Kate Shoemaker who have each started all nine games for the Gauchos. Also providing strong contributions are sophomore Ryan Kokoska and senior Savannah Francis.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also feature a strong offensive attack. They have scored 19 goals this year, averaging over two goals per game. Junior forward Amanda Ball leads the team and ranks second in the Big West with eight goals in the year. She also leads the team with 33 shots and 19 shots on goal to go along with a 57.6 percent shot on goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward/midfielder Shaelan Murison has also emerged for the Gauchos, coming off a spectacular hat trick performance against Texas – San Antonio last week. She now has four goals on the season, all coming in the last three games.</p>\n<p>In addition, sophomore Mallory Hromatko has three goals this year and has taken 14 shots — six on goal — providing solid contributions along the front line.</p>\n<p>The team also has 17 assists on the year. Three players each lead the team in assists this year with three apiece: senior midfielder Ashley Dean, sophomore midfielder Madeline Gibson and senior defender Savannah Francis.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Gauchos, the University of the Pacific has not fared well so far this season.</p>\n<p>After being defeated 2-1 by UC Davis last week, the Tigers have scored only five goals in their seven games played this year and have tallied two assists thus far while possessing a subpar .077 shot percentage.</p>\n<p>Pacific is currently led by its freshman midfielder Sigrid Aas who has two goals this season. She has taken 14 shots with eight of those on goal.</p>\n<p>Junior defender Loren Landrus also has two goals for the Tigers this year with four shots on goal. The only other player to score a goal for the team is junior midfielder Lily Higashino.</p>\n<p>Pacific is fresh off a five-game road trip and will be playing at home at Knoles Field for the first time since late August. The Gauchos, who will be playing the third of a four-game road trip, can expect the Tigers to be excited for their return home in pursuit of an upset.</p>\n<p>Unlike Pacific, LMU has gotten off to a more positive start as it was able to put together a three-game winning streak earlier in the month with wins over CSU Bakersfield, Long Beach State and Ball State. The Lions most recent game, however, against Texas Tech was a tough battle that ended in a double overtime tie.</p>\n<p>So far, the Lions have scored a total of 20 goals in addition to recording 13 assists. Sophomore forward Sarina Bolden leads the team with three goals this season and has established a strong presence on offense.

Unfortunately for the Gauchos, though, the ball was just out of All-American striker Nick DePuy’s reach right before the break, leaving LMU’s lead at 1-0 going into the locker room.</p>\n<p>Less than two minutes into the second half, LMU doubled their lead with a wonder of a volley from 25 yards by Jose Ochoa. The ball bounced out in front of him perfectly, and the Lions’ defender struck an inch-perfect screamer that flew past the helpless Le Roux in the right side netting.</p>\n<p>“The biggest issue for us is that we have two or three players that would absolutely help us and would’ve gotten us out of a game like this, but this was a tired group tonight after UCLA,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Feucht won the ball on the wing and feinted to his right before finding DePuy, who was taken down by a rash Lion challenge. Feucht then stepped up to slot the penalty into the bottom right corner past the diving keeper for his team-leading fifth goal.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ second goal came 10 minutes later when Josue España’s curling shot from the top of the box troubled the goalkeeper. The shot was blocked, but it landed just in the middle of the box, where an oncoming Noah Billingsley slotted past the grounded keeper to equalize at 2-2.</p>\n<p>Billingsley, who was capped with the New Zealand U-20s team at the 2015 U-20 World Cup, found the net for the first time in UCSB colors and toyed with the LMU left-back all night in what was probably the best performance of his debut season thus far.</p>\n<p>LMU regained their lead in the 83rd minute, though, when midfielder Antonio Porreco carved his way with a swerved dribbling run, finishing off the move with a tidy left-footed shot across the goal.</p>\n<p>Just a minute later, the Lions failed to clear out a corner fully, and the second cross found Feucht on the far side, who chested down the cross and tapped a light volley into DePuy. The striker controlled the ball with his first touch, and his second was a rifled left-footed shot that rose into the top-right corner to draw the Gauchos level for the second time, this time at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The game took its final turn in the 86th minute when an LMU corner was sent dangerously into a huge crowd of players from each team, and Connor Johnson rose highest to head home past Le Roux who was knocked down in the mix-up. The last 10 minutes were wide open, but Johnson’s header gave the visitors their third win against Big West opposition.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next match is their final non-conference game of the regular season against Cal at 7:05 p.m. on Friday, September 23 at Harder Stadium</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/","id":1432,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1431,1430,1429],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":71,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
