Wade was a +1600 underdog. Meaning, had Wade won and someone placed a hundred dollar bet on him, those that gambled on the 26 year old would have received a $1600 payout according to <em>ESPN.com</em>.</p>\n<p>However, the game of odds did not hold much significance in Saturday’s bout once the bell rung and the referee gave the signal for the clash to begin as Golovkin established his lopsided dominance from its very beginning.</p>\n<p>Wade, in his neon green Everlast gloves, attempted to establish the jab early against a fairly static Golovkin. In typical Triple G fashion, Gennady walked down his opponent and did not show much head movement in the early parts of the round, but Wade was unable to capitalize on Golovkin’s lax defense.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the round, Golovkin, a Kazakhstan native, landed a solid overhand right and dropped Wade for the first time with only ten seconds remaining in the opening round, marking the beginning of the end for the young American middleweight.</p>\n<p>Despite getting knocked down in the first, Wade seemed to have gotten himself back together as he entered the second round connecting with a flurry of punches, but Golovkin regained his composure showing some solid defense and continued to seek his opponent.</p>\n<p>Triple G took the punishment but seemed unmoved and responded a few moments later with a three punch combination that would drop Wade for a second time. The jab, uppercut and cross all landed with fervor and it might have been the end right there, but Dominic showed the heart of a champion by getting up and began exchanging once again. Regardless of the heart Dominic displayed, Gennady Golovkin wrapped up the night by delivering an unforgiving right hand on the button. With all that it was over.</p>\n<p>As Triple G added another consecutive knockout as well as another successful title defense to his already impressive resume, there was a question looming over everyone’s head: Will Saul “Canelo” Alvarez be the next opponent?</p>\n<p>For the sake of boxing, we hope so.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned in my colleague Sean White’s “Rebirth of The Ringside, Thurman Vs. Porter,” the sport of boxing is due for a major facelift. As the career of Manny Pacquiao nears its ending following the retirement of Floyd Mayweather Jr., the boxing industry is in need of a new ‘poster boy.’</p>\n<p>However, what my fellow counterpart has failed to mention is that the sport of boxing does not need to be revived; it has and always will continue to thrive. Perhaps to the casual boxing fan there are not enough stars in the sport to attract them to drop hard-earned cash to watch a hard-fought fight.</p>\n<p>Certainly, UFC and MMA has been a hot commodity over the past years, garnering the attention of many. But the truth of the matter is that both fighting organizations still have a long way to go. With regard to the vulnerability of all fighters in both MMA and boxing, it’s difficult to surpass the reality that the elite fighters of the UFC and MMA still make just a fraction of the pay day’s top prize fighters in boxing currently make.</p>\n<p>A fair question would be, why is it that there is such a disparity between combat athletes? I would propose to take a look at the popularity of the sports as a primary indicator as to how much each sport can afford to pay its athletes.</p>\n<p>The more paying viewers open to patronize the sport, the more the promotion has in profit, which in turn can find its way to compensate the fighters.</p>\n<p>According to a survey conducted on the discrepancy between the two combat sports posted on <em>sherdog.com</em>, the global authority on mixed martial arts, MMA has less avid fans than boxing.</p>\n<p>The amount of boxing fans weigh in at totals of 12,698,000, while the MMA fan base is at 12,219,000. Aside from the sheer numbers, it is when the demographics get broken down that there is a clearer understanding as to why one sport makes more money than the other.</p>\n<p>MMA has more viewers in the 18-29 age group than boxing. A total of 1,133,000 in that demographic have reported that they would prefer to watch Mixed Martial Arts. According to the same study on the other hand, the older age groups consisting of 30-44 and 45-64 would rather watch boxing. That is 853,000 more people with more money to spend.</p>\n<p>Even though the future is looking good for MMA, currently the demographic with the most disposable income would prefer to spend their cash on good ol’ fashion pugilism.</p>\n<p>Despite all the numbers, statistics, PPV buys and more, most people get stuck in a mindset of the polarity. For most people it is either or, but one thing is for sure. There is definitely enough room for the both of them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/","id":3300,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[3299,3298,3297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hoping to Make Late Surge in Home Finale, To Celebrate Seniors","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_4-23-16_8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_4-23-16_8-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the opportunity to possibly ascend to a potential clinching of the No. 2 seed in the Big West standings over the next two weeks, the UCSB softball team will attempt to end its two-game losing str...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a tough weekend at home for the UCSB softball team, the Gauchos will remain at Campus Diamond this weekend in hopes of overcoming their recent two-game slump with an opportunity to improve their record against the visiting University of Hawaii.

However, the Wahine lineup includes several talented hitters who may pose a threat to the Gauchos’ pitching staff.</p>\n<p>One of these hidden talents is the Wahine’s sophomore utility player Rachel Lack. Although Lack hits fairly low in the batting order, she has a team high 20 RBIs so far this season. Most notably, despite a meager .200 hitting clip and nine runs scored, slugging the softball out of the park appears to be her optimal strength as she has also banged out a team high five home runs.</p>\n<p>Moreover, freshman utility player Sarah Muzik has proven to be a stand out hitter as she leads the team with 25 runs scored this season. Muzik hits third in the lineup with a .282 batting average. She has contributed three doubles and five RBIs this season.</p>\n<p>Behind Muzik with 24 runs scored this season is senior outfielder Keiki Carlos, who also has 40 hits. Carlos leads Hawaii with a .296 batting average and nine doubles. She has also tallied 12 RBIs and three home runs this season.</p>\n<p>The Wahine’s sophomore starting pitcher Brittany Hitchcock will come into the series with a 9-13 record and a 2.28 ERA. In 138.1 innings pitched, she has given up 45 earned runs and 153 hits this season.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho lineup should not have much trouble getting through to her, as collectively they are hitting .301, and have scored 203 runs this season.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Kristen Clark will be sure to bring the heat in this weekend’s matchup. She leads UCSB with an outstanding .420 batting average and 37 runs scored this season. She’s also contributed two doubles and 16 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Alongside her is senior infielder Arianna Palomares who has had clutch performances lately, scoring a game-winning homerun in last weekend’s series opener against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>Palomares has tallied in a total of 27 runs scored this season, along with three home runs. She has also contributed 29 RBIs which is second best on the team right behind freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer who leads with 34.</p>\n<p>Another Gaucho player who will be on Hawaii’s radar is junior infielder Emily Brucelas who has made her way to the top of the lineup, contributing 25 runs scored this season. She has slugged a team-high four home runs along with Altmeyer, and has contributed 22 RBIs. Brucelas has also banged out seven doubles.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been able to limit their opponents to a .290 batting average. Starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow continues to fight for her team on the mound as she has collected a total of 135 strikeouts this season. Ludlow has maintained a solid 2.96 ERA, giving up only 61 earned runs in 144.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The first game of the series will take place on Friday, April 29 at 3 p.m. The following two games will take place on Saturday, April 30 at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. All games will be played at Campus Diamond.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/","id":51,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[50,49,48],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Risky Plunge Rewarded","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Committed to enhancing her performance in the pool, Lauren Martin’s intentional redshirt decision has resulted in a career year for the center thus far.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>From the moment that a student-athlete enrolls full time in school, their five-year window of athletic eligibility begins to roll.

Others may choose to take advantage of that extra year to work on their skills so that they may gain more playing time in their sport for the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Yet neither of these reasons apply to senior center Lauren Martin of the UCSB women’s water polo team.</p>\n<p>The Clovis West High School graduate joined the Gaucho family after a very successful high school career in which she earned seven varsity letters both in water polo as well as swimming. She is a two-time All-American, collecting First Team honors as a senior and Fourth Team accolades as a junior.</p>\n<p>Martin was also an All-CIF Central Section selection twice and earned All-Tri River Athletic Conference distinction two times as well. Martin led her team to three consecutive Tri River Athletic Conference titles and individually won consecutive CIF championships in 2008 and 2009.</p>\n<p>It was no surprise that after all of those merits, the freshman went on to play in all 35 games in her first season, generating 29 goals and 13 assists and finishing the season with an impressive shooting percentage of .392. Martin also led the team in earned penalties and ejections with a high count of 47 that year. The two following years were as productive as the first, contributing 24 and 33 goals her sophomore and junior season, respectively.</p>\n<p>Playing time was not a problem for Lauren who had certainly earned her spot as the team’s center player; however, coming into her fourth season she decided to take a year off.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I redshirted last year is because I had certain goals for myself and I felt that I would meet those goals if I took off a year and just trained,” Martin said. “We had a new coach and I wanted to try and figure out her coaching style and also because our team was very young.”</p>\n<p>Train she did, and it certainly paid off. Although players continue to assist practice and play against their own teammates, not participating in games against outside competitors can deteriorate some athletes’ skills.</p>\n<p>Yet, this was not the case when it came to Martin.</p>\n<p>Right from the start of this season, her presence made such a significant impact on the team. In her first game back against Cal, she put away four goals alone, proving that she had been waiting to be back in the pool with her teammates for a very long time and seemed determined to make the most of her senior campaign.</p>\n<p>“She’s been sitting for over a year waiting to play,” Head Coach Serela Kay mentioned in an interview earlier this year. “She’s excited, and we’re excited to have her back in the paint to fill that role and she’s doing great.”</p>\n<p>Even after her outstanding performance that weekend, it remained unpredictable just how “great” she would continue to do throughout the season and how much of an influence she would have on the team.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really have the mindset of ‘Oh I hope I do well,’” Marin said. “It was just what was expected, out of the whole entire team, even, not just myself.”</p>\n<p>The 5’10” center finished her last season with UCSB as the team’s leading scorer with 45 goals and a striking shooting percentage of .517, feats that helped her to earn Big West Player of the Week honors twice this season.</p>\n<p>However, the importance of her contributions to the team were not only in the amount of goals that she would put away each game, but also in their timing.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, Martin came in clutch when the team needed her the most. She had a couple of game-winners, some occurring in overtime, which would give the Gauchos the victory in addition to being a catalyst that occasionally sparked the team when it needed to recoup in dire situations.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I go in the game, it is my job to get a goal or set a teammate up with a really nice pass or earn an ejection so that someone else can score,” Martin said modestly. “My mindset going is to give 110 percent every time I go in the water.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the senior might attribute some of her collegiate success both in and out of the pool to her earlier years when she participated in the Olympic Development Program.</p>\n<p>The program’s purpose is develop players that will represent USA Water Polo throughout domestic and international competition. With such high expectations and the effort that is required of all athletes, the experience was beneficial beyond the depths of the pool, helping individuals improve as everyday people.</p>\n<p>“It showed me commitment, and just going into those practices knowing that you have eight hours of practice ahead, but knowing that it will all pay off in the long run teaches you determination,” Martin said. “It also helped with time management, knowing that I had a long practice ahead and I had to plan for school and other stuff I had to do.”</p>\n<p>While her career at UCSB might be over after the Big West Tournament, Martin hopes to continue doing what she loves in the future. While nothing is set in stone yet, word has it that this powerful player will be taking her talents overseas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70437\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70437\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/","id":1970,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[1969,1968,1967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set To Defend Last Years’ Title At Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a perfect record in the Big West and capturing the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament, UCSB is ready to defend its championship title.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After capping off the dual match season defeating every Big West opponent and capturing the regular season conference title, the No. 46 UCSB men’s tennis team will head to Indian Wells, CA to compete in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70393\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70393\" data-attachment-id=\"70393\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/gauchos-set-to-defend-big-west-championship/andrew-rimington-just-barely-returns-a-short-ball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Andrew Rimington just barely returns a short ball.

For these two, competing at a high level is nothing new, and playing at a Division I NCAA level is just another accolade, another bullet point on their highly impressive resumes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For these emerging tennis stars, playing the sport of tennis began around the same age most of us were first learning our arithmetic or how to tie our shoes. Even as children, Dubavets and Stojic knew that delivering a potent serve or a strong swing would be more than just a pastime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dubavets, originally from Minsk, Belarus, began playing tennis at the age of seven. A few short years later, she realized what the sport could possibly mean for her and her family.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Tennis became the goal for me when I was around 10, then at 12 my parents moved to another city because of tennis, so it became really serious for me. It was taking up a lot of time,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With her family rallying behind her, Dubavets did not take long to prove that their sacrifices would not be in vain. She was selected to represent her native country of Belarus in the 2011 Junior European Championships, and to this day, it continues to be one of the most memorable moments of her tennis career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her first time around, she made it to the third round in singles before eventually falling to current professional tennis player Viktoriya Tomova from Bulgaria. In doubles, it was a similar story as she lost to a Ukraine native in the third round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following year, Dubavets and her partner, Iryna Shymanovich, made it to the semifinals of the same tournament. However, thanks to her persistence, and with the help of her fellow compatriots, Belarus reached a world stage by qualifying for a world tournament for the first time in nearly 20 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, despite what she was able to provide for her country, she did not receive the backing of her federation to the degree others were.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It came to a point around 16 years old when there was trouble with money and the federation was helping only the best of the best,”Dubavets explained. “That made it hard to make it to a lot of the tournaments, so that’s when I decided to go to college.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new target was set in between her sights, and after a couple of goodbyes were exchanged,Dubavets took a risk and found herself surrounded by new people in a new country playing the same game she has always known.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was brought to Texas Christian University’s team, a program that was ranked No. 17 in the nation at the time, by first-year Coach Lee Taylor Walker and Assistant Coach Ben Stapp.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dubavets’ time was brief, but she still managed to play in a total of 60 matches in her first year in both singles and doubles play. In singles, she recorded a 17-10 overall record along with recording a 19-14 doubles record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After just one year at TCU, Palina decided it would be in her best interest to look for a fresh start out West. Her search for a new place to call home came to a close once she became acquainted with UCSB’s elite coaching staff, stellar academics and sunny California weather.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Two main reasons to come here: the coaches and academics. I had to be really sure that the coaches were really good because they take a lot of time from your life, so I had to make sure there was a good chemistry,”Dubavets said. “Academics are definitely a lot better here at UCSB than TCU, and the location and climate is really good for tennis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Able to complete the transfer process and be welcomed to the UCSB women’s tennis program with open arms, Dubavets became another international asset to Santa Barbara’s program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering UCSB with similar intentions of a fresh start, Australia native Stojic was determined to contribute to the Gauchos’ recruiting progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stojic picked up the tennis racket at an early age and has yet to put it down. Since then, she has made quite an impact in the tennis community by creating an extensive resume of her own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I started when I was seven. It got pretty serious, and then from there it was just playing under Australia and representing Australia through all those International Tennis Federation and junior tournaments,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After years of training, her junior career culminated during the 2011 Australian Open whenStojic faced some of today’s tennis stars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the main draw of the girl singles competition, she was pitted against Klara Fabikova from the Czech Republic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Fabikova plays for the Golden Bears of Cal and is ranked No. 12 in the nation according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. Stefani managed to demonstrate what she is capable of by defeating a young Fabikova 6-3 in two consecutive sets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following round, Stojic competed against Monica Puig who is currently ranked top 40 in the world in the pro circuit, and the experience that Stefani had with her is something she has yet to forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After participating in junior competitions, Stojic, like her fellow Gaucho transfer teammate Dubavets, made a decision to go to college because of the financial hardships that come with participating in tournaments at an elite level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So instead of going pro right after high school, she decided to pursue tennis at one of the best tennis programs in the country, the University of Florida, is currently ranked third in the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I didn’t know I was going to go to college,” Stojic said. “I thought I was going to jump into professional tennis, but financially it was too hard to travel. So, I came to college looking to get better and get a degree.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like most professional athletes can attest to, the journey is not a simple one, it is a process of stumbling and overcoming any obstacles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two years of being underutilized at the University of Florida, Stojic decided to take her talents to Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t get to play much, and we had a really strong team at the University of Florida,” Stojic explained. “We had eight players and it was always hard to get into the lineup. I personally want to go pro after college, so for me, it was important to get a load of matches and playing so I can go pro. So I was trying to find a school that I knew I would be playing top in line and get good quality matches every week consistently.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing time and opportunity have definitely been afforded to both Stojic and Dubavets here at UCSB. Regardless of all the chances that might be offered, it is up to the athlete to ensure that their production equals or even surpasses expectation in order to ensure a spot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two definitely have not disappointed as they have helped the Gauchos amass their season-high national ranking of No. 65 earlier in the season. They have been an important staple for UCSB’s young roster as the two are currently the team’s leaders in wins in singles and doubles at the one slot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to doubles action,Stojic and Dubavets have been a force to be reckoned with, losing only twice this season. They also have had an undefeated record against other top ranked doubles duos, having defeated No. 7 Gabby Smith and Giuliana Olmos of USC earlier in the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus far, Stojic and Dubavets have thrived at the collegiate level, reaching a high doubles ranking albeit playing together for just one year. Competing together has come naturally as the two have meshed quite well with an impeccable chemistry on and off the courts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are both aggressive players with a good serve, and it’s just a really good mix, so it’s all been pretty easy,” Dubavets said. “There is a lot of chemistry and confidence between us”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been pretty easy, because our game styles are pretty similar and our personalities as well. It’s been chill, all very chill when we play together,” Stojic agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two, along with the rest of the currently No. 74 ranked UCSB women’s tennis team, are players to keep an eye on as they prepare for the Big West Championships beginning this Thursday, April 28th, with hopes of making it to the NCAA Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from excelling at the collegiate level, Stojic and Dubavets are aiming to do what their competitors have already done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I still definitely want to turn pro afterwards, give it a good two years and hopefully get a sponsor that can help me work and travel and make it on the pro side” Stojic said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outlook for both players is tremendous as they have another year to work together. As long as they maintain the faith in the process, they will only continue to grow as athletes in the sport of tennis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not every year that two talented individual players with similar backgrounds and expectations of the sport can come together and play with something to prove. But sometimes, just sometimes, greatness comes in pairs.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/","id":83,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[82,81,80],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 20 Gauchos Looking Forward To Rematch Against Gaels","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will look to avenge not only its three losses this past weekend courtesy of Cal Poly but also look to avenge its previous loss to the St. Mary's earlier this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a disappointing weekend that saw the No. 20 UCSB baseball team drop from first to fourth in the conference standings and seven spots in the national rankings, it will look to begin a fresh start this week with a Tuesday game against St. Mary’s.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68682\" style=\"width: 343px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68682\" data-attachment-id=\"68682\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-01/ucsb-looks-to-continue-winning-ways-against-no-21-ucla/justin-kelly-sends-a-curveball-to-the-batter-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Justin Kelly sends a curveball to the batter.

The loss was the first Santa Barbara had suffered this season after starting 4-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That loss was a brutal one for pitcher Trevor Bettancourt (2-1) who came in relief in the eighth inning and allowed five runs on five hits and credited with the loss.</p>\n<p>However, the redshirt junior has bounced back mightily after that brutal 2/3’s inning of relief. Since then the righty has allowed only seven hits and one earned run in 15.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason Bettancourt had such a rough time is because the Gaels have a slew of hitters that can take it to any pitcher in the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>These hitters include players such as sophomores Zach Kirtley and outfielder Joey Fiske. The two sophomores rank first and second in batting average with .360 and .331 respectively.</p>\n<p>Kirtley is first on the team in slugging percentage (.566) and on-base percentage (.473). The infielder is also tied for first in home runs (5), hits (49) and RBI (27).</p>\n<p>Senior infielder Anthony Villa is another strong hitter for St. Mary’s as he is also tied for first with Kirtley in home runs and RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior Nate Nolan is another viable hitter ranking second in hits (41), RBI (23), and slugging percentage (.500). The catcher had a solid game last time against UCSB going 3-5 (.600) with three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Although the Gaels are a strong hitting team, the Gauchos have their own slew of hitters that make them dangerous on any given day.</p>\n<p>They are led by sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (26) and is second in hits (35), and slugging percentage (.466). Redshirt junior outfielder Andrew Calica leads the team in hits (37) ranks second in on base percentage (.477) and fourth in batting average (.291).</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomores JJ Muno, a second baseman, and Josh Adams, designated hitter, both lead the team in home runs with four each. Adams also ranks second in RBI with a solid 23 on the season.</p>\n<p>A player who has also come on as of late is redshirt junior Devon Gradford who now leads the team in batting average (.387) and slugging percentage (.486).</p>\n<p>This weekday game will look to be a bounce back for the Gauchos. Although they are still having a solid season, being swept is never an easy thing to bounce back from especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>One problem  facing Santa Barbara this game and the entire season is the fact that they are on the road. Currently the Gauchos are 5-9-1 away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium and have lost four of their last six on the road.</p>\n<p>This game against the Gaels is important to see not only how UCSB will respond to its three-game losing streak, longest of the season, and how it can try to avenge its loss to the Gaels earlier this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end their four-game road stand against St. Mary’s on today at 3 p.m. at Louis Guisto Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Mustangs junior pitcher Justin Calomeni then ended any hopes of a Gaucho comeback after striking out the last two batters, earning his sixth save, and giving his team the 4-3 victory and series sweep.</p>\n<p>Before finishing off the sweep, Cal Poly rallied of 10 runs while limiting Santa Barbara to five runs to—at the very least at the time—seal the series win over their blue rival.</p>\n<p>After allowing two runs in the top of the first inning, the Mustangs responded with a four-run first inning, due in large part to Sanderson two-RBI double, to take an early 4-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tied the game at four in the top of the second inning thanks to senior third baseman Ryan Clark’s RBI single and redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s RBI single. Cal Poly added on run in the bottom frame to retake a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs would add two more runs in the bottom of the third inning to now take an even bigger lead at 7-4.</p>\n<p>By this point in the game, freshman pitcher Noah Davis (3-2) was sat after four innings. It was the young pitchers worst outing of the season allowing seven runs on eight hits including allowing one home run.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the rest of the game, Cal Poly added three runs compared to Santa Barbara’s one and won the game fairly easily after struggling to stop UCSB’s high-powered offense in the first few innings.</p>\n<p>It was another solid outing for star Mustang pitcher Erich Uelman (5-0) who pitched eight innings allowing five runs on eight hits but more importantly extended his perfect record this season to 5-0.</p>\n<p>Before losing only its second weekend series of the season, the Gauchos displayed their worst performance of the season being blanked 7-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB registered two hits over the course of nine innings, its worst total of the season but Cal Poly took advantage of its rival slow day scoring seven runs on thirteen hits.</p>\n<p>Gaucho junior pitcher Shane Bieber (7-2) kept the game close early allowing three runs in the games first six innings however, in the final two innings he came undone allowing four runs.</p>\n<p>Bieber came into the game hot off two straight complete-game victories and a 2.74 season ERA but was taken to school by the Mustang hitters and handed the pitcher his second loss of the season.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly won thanks to big performances from great players such as senior Josh Schuknecht who had two hits and three RBI, sophomore Josh George who went 3-4 (.750) with one RBI and Meyer who had two hits.</p>\n<p>The top four hitters of the Mustang line-up went 9-17 (.529) with six RBI in their strong victory over one of the better teams in the country.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend was a bad one for the Gauchos. Not only did they get swept and now fell in the standings but really showed its vulnerability going on the road. They are now 4-8-1 on the road this season.</p>\n<p>With eight of its final 20 games on the road, UCSB cannot afford to drop all those games—especially the conference ones—simply because it is away from the comfort ability of home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue end their four-game road stand against St. Mary’s on Tuesday, April 26 at 3 p.m. at Dickinson Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

While for the Beach, the win made history. For the first time in its eight years of conference participation, LBSU has assumed the title of Big West regular season champions.</p>\n<p>The victory can be accredited to the 49ers defense, who did a remarkable job shutting down the Gauchos’ tenacious attackers. Their senior goalkeeper Alexis Butler, showed off her skills in her last regular season game obtaining a career-high with 17 saves. Despite UCSB outshooting the Beach 23-13, Butler made it almost impossible for the Gauchos to find the back of the net.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the first three minutes of the match, the Gauchos wasted no time attacking and put away three unanswered goals. The first came at the 6:36 mark from senior center Lauren Martin on a power play. Right after that junior utility Miranda Schrader went on to score two consecutive goals within a 43 second span giving UCSB an early lead.</p>\n<p>At the two minute mark, Long Beach drew an ejection and LBSU’s Alexandra Massier capatilized on the play with a pass from Jessica Brooks. The first quarter ended 3-1 despite several opportunities on both sides of the pool.</p>\n<p>Within 40 seconds of the second quarter, senior attacker Bryn Hudson reclaimed the three-goal lead for the Gauchos after an early exclusion. The shot however, did not go unreciprocated. Annabel Harman hit a bounce shot which skipped past senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw moving the score 4-2.</p>\n<p>After that the Gauchos had three consecutive possessions, but were unable to finish the plays. The first was saved by Butler, the second shot hit the right post and bounced back, while the third shot went off one of LBSU’s defenders.</p>\n<p>A shot from the 49ers closed the gap to 4-3, but the Gauchos had the last say before break with a backhanded goal from Martin with only 45 seconds left of the first half.</p>\n<p>The Beach battled their way back from a two-point deficit in the third quarter. With Emily Garcynski and Massier scoring one a piece on 6-on-5 situations, the Gauchos were shutout 2-0 and the game was tied 5-5 going into the fourth.</p>\n<p>The intensity of the game increased in the fourth quarter as both teams knew what was at stake and went at it with all they had. Neither team allowed a goal in the first five minutes of the period. It wasn’t until the 2:49 mark that the 49ers broke the silence and put one away to claim the lead for the first time in the game, 6-5. The Gauchos responded quickly knowing there was not much time left drawing an exclusions and finding the equalizer by Schrader, her third goal of the match.</p>\n<p>With 14 seconds left on the clock, the Beach had the final possession and they made use of it. Garczynski shot the ball after a couple of passes and scored in the last second to give the 49ers the victory.</p>\n<p>Brokaw finished with a total of 6 saves, four of them in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Although regular season is now over, the Gauchos will prepare to return home to Campus Pool this weekend to host the Big West Tournament. Santa Barbara, who is third-seeded will kick off the weekend with sixth seeded CSUN on Friday at 2 p.m. A win over the Matadors would give the Gauchos a rematch with Long Beach State on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched well and threw a complete game in collecting her eighth win of the season. Facing 31 batters, Ludlow allowed only two earned runs and nine hits while striking out six.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as the wind at Campus Diamond picked up, so did the 49ers in their 14-6 win in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader.</p>\n<p>The start of the second game looked promising for the Gauchos when in the first inning senior catcher Samantha Stark hit a double to left field, bringing home junior infielder Kristen Clark and sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston, giving UCSB a 2-0 cushion.</p>\n<p>Stark was one of the biggest playmakers on the day for the Gauchos, finishing 3-4 with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of fire, we were just really excited and we had a lot of fight within us,” Stark said.</p>\n<p>The second inning would expose a weak Gauchos’ defense, as UCSB suffered from major fielding errors. With just one more out needed to get the Gauchos out of the second inning, a UCSB error on a deep ball into left field resulted in the 49ers’ first run of the game.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the only unearned run Long Beach would score, as the 49ers tallied four more unearned runs in the second, putting the score at 5-2 until UCSB finally recorded the third out. Long Beach State’s first ten runs were all unearned.</p>\n<p>There was a hopeful moment in the third for the Gauchos when they cut the 49er lead from three runs to one thanks to a clutch double to center field from junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos, scoring Menor and junior infielder Emily Brucelas on the play.</p>\n<p>This was the closest the Gauchos would get, as the 49ers collected another five runs in the fourth, and another four in the seventh. Cavazos also had a big day for the Gauchos, going 2-3 at the plate and finishing with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s final game was a blow to the Gauchos confidence, as they were shutout by the 49ers, unable to put a single run on the board. Long Beach however had a different day as they piled nine runs on UCSB in just five innings.</p>\n<p>The young freshman pitcher Ashley Wright saw some action in the last 1.2 innings of the game, providing much needed relief. She allowed only one hit and struck out one.</p>\n<p>Ludlow, however, took the loss after tossing 2.2 innings and giving up five earned runs off of 6 hits. She was unable to strike out any 49ers. Gulvin also pitched .2 innings in the game, but was quickly relieved by Wright when she gave up four runs.</p>\n<p>UCSB had only two hits in the game, one each by Junior infielder Emily Brucelas and Arianna Palomares with Brucelas’ hit coming on a double in the third inning. Long Beach starting pitcher Christina Clermont threw a complete game, striking out 9 Gauchos and walking none in picking up her 16th win of the season.</p>\n<p>“We have to just keep fighting. With our conference, anything can happen so we have to keep fighting and doing what we have to do,” said Stark.</p>\n<p>Following the weekend, the Gauchos now sit at 22-25 overall and 5-7 in Big West play. The 49ers improved to 26-17 overall, 6-6 in conference play. Long Beach is currently ranked third in the Big West standings while UCSB is close behind ranked fourth. UCSB will prepare to face Hawaii at home next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70365\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70365\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/","id":50,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[49,48,47],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Fall Short in Comeback Attempt, Await Selection Process","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MVolleyball_vsPepperdine-20150130-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MVolleyball_vsPepperdine-20150130-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling behind 2-0, the No. 6 UCSB men's volleyball team managed to nearly stage a victory in its comeback pursuit in its MPSF Semifinal matchup against No. 1 BYU.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past Thursday, the No. 5 seeded UCSB men’s volleyball team managed to force a fifth set against No. 1 BYU after dropping the first two frames, but were unable to close out the match in its final stretch as the Gauchos’ six-match streak was ended in the MPSF Semifinals.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60921\" style=\"width: 334px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60921\" data-attachment-id=\"60921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/mens-volleyball-sweeps-ucla-on-the-road/mvolleyball_vspepperdine-20150130-dustinharris-1-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MVolleyball_vsPepperdine-20150130-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Hayden Boehle passes the ball, while Jacob Delson is ready to assist.

Senior Jonah Seif took over at the start of the third set, though, to help his team back into the match.</p>\n<p>The setter recorded two kills and five assists to race out to a 7-2 lead in the third, and the Gauchos were able to hold onto their lead for the rest of the set to close it out 25-23. Seif finished the night with 57 assists and seven kills to his name.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s attack was distributed particularly evenly, with all five hitters recording at least 12 kills, led by junior opposite Matt Marsh and senior middle blocker Ryan Hardy, who each tallied 15.</p>\n<p>In the fourth set it was more of the same, with the Gauchos fending off the Cougars, holding onto their lead from 10-10 and beyond, never leading by more than two in the frame. Sophomore outside hitter Hayden Boehle, who made his way into the starting lineup during the last week of the regular season, led the team with 5 of his 12 kills in the set.</p>\n<p>Hayden’s brother, junior libero, Parker, continued his string of impressive defensive performances, recording a game-high 16 digs in the loss. The libero counted his eighth ten-dig game of the season, and the fourth in as many games, leading the defensive charge.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense couldn’t contain the threat of BYU opposite Ben Patch, who tallied a game high 32 kills, the highest total by a player in any of the Gauchos’ matches this year.</p>\n<p>Patch closed out the match in the final set, too, with five kills in the frame, two of which all but sealed the fixture, giving BYU a three-point lead at 13-10. Patch and co. ultimately held onto their three-point lead to advance to the MPSF Conference Championship game against UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now look towards the draw for the 2016 Spring Championship Selection, which airs today at 10 a.m. live on <em><a href=\"http://ncaa.com\">NCAA.com</a></em>.</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently ranked No. 6 in the Coaches’ Poll, and will be vying for one of the last spots in the six-team field which will almost certainly include No.1 BYU, No.2 Ohio State and No. 3 UCLA. The last three spots are open for the taking, with the next five teams in the national rankings coming out of the powerful MPSF.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-24/gauchos-fall-short-in-comeback-attempt-await-selection-process/","id":5350,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5349,5348,5347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Upset Alert?

The win streak has been led by senior setter Jonah Seif and his crew of hitters, namely redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh.<br>\nSeif, who was just named to the MPSF All-Conference First Team, has 1,102 assists on the year and is eight assists away from setting his career-high single-season assist total.</p>\n<p>Marsh, Second Team honoree, has led the offense since outside hitter Jacob Delson’s ankle injury averaging 14.6 kills per match in the past five.</p>\n<p>The two other All-Conference Gauchos, redshirt senior middle blockers Ryan Hardy and redshirt freshman Henri Cherry, who were both Honorable Mentions, have also come up huge to take pressure off of the hitters offensively.</p>\n<p>Hardy tallied a season-high 12 kills last week and Cherry, also named to the All-Freshman team, has averaged 9.2 kills per match for the duration of the team’s win streak.</p>\n<p>Delson has been easing back into the team after missing two weeks and came on to serve at the end of three sets last match against Stanford.</p>\n<p>One of the unsung heroes of the Gauchos’ recent run has been libero Parker Boehle. The defensive specialist has recorded double-digit digs in the past three matches, including 14 in the first round against Stanford.</p>\n<p>In the conference meetings with BYU, Santa Barbara struggled to contain the Cougar attack as they hit for .330 and .487 in each match. UCSB has been steadier defensively as of late, recording 40 digs in its last three showings.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos win at BYU, they would book themselves in a spot in the MPSF Conference Finals, against the either second-seed UCLA or third-seed CSULB.</p>\n<p>The semifinal will take place tonight at 6:35 p.m. in Provo, Utah.

However, it will not be an easy task for the Gauchos, who will be facing No. 17 Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>For the first time in program history, the 49ers currently gloat an undefeated conference record. With a 16-9 overall and 3-0 record in the Big West, the Beach currently sits at the top of the conference rankings and is hoping to remain right where it’s at in order to claim its first Big West regular season title in the program’s eight years of conference participation.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos are one game behind the 49ers, the regular season title could go to either team at this point. Long Beach will have to win both games if it wants to complete an outright claim of the Big West title.</p>\n<p>With such high stakes on the line, the game will really come down to who wants to win the most and who is going to take everything that has been learned throughout the season and apply it in crunch time.</p>\n<p>One factor that can come into play for the 49ers is their home advantage. Long Beach currently holds a 6-1 home record — its only loss was about a month ago in a narrow 8-7 battle against San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The rowdiness of the Long Beach State fans is, however, the least of UCSB’s worries. The real challenge will be trying to contain its opponent’s offense, as LBSU has consistently put up 9.84 goals per game and only allows an average of 6.80 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Leading for the 49ers is the Canadian sophomore Virginia Smith with 41 goals this season. Right behind her are freshman Tori Morrissey and sophomore Alexandra Massier with a total of 34 and 33 goals, respectively.</p>\n<p>Aside from the three players previously mentioned, the 49ers’ roster consists of another four international players, which means they have great experience competing at high national levels — always a favorable quality to have in a team.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos, the team has been doing a superb job at communicating and feeding off of each other’s play. A key catalyst has been senior center Lauren Martin throughout the season, especially in the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>Martin was named Big West player of the week for her outstanding contribution to the team’s back-to-back victories over Hawaii and Davis two weekends ago. The Fresno native scored a couple of goals in the 7-6 victory over Davis, including a clutch goal in sudden death overtime to give the Gauchos the win. And against the ‘Bows, it was Martin’s goal who sparked a 3-0 run for Santa Barbara to win 7-5 along with two earned ejections.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will count on Martin to continue setting the pace for the offense this weekend and focus on working together to limit CSULB’s chances of scoring.</p>\n<p>The season finale will take place at Long Beach State this Saturday, April 23 starting at 12 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Santa Barbara is trying to capture its first Big West title since 1986.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good start so far and I like the way we are playing,” Redshirt junior Andrew Calica said. “and we just hope to continue with that momentum.”</p>\n<p>On the opposite of the spectrum, Cal Poly is looking to take a series from another great conference opponent after taking two of three from both Hawaii and the defending Big West champion Titans of CSUF.</p>\n<p>These two teams met a year ago with UCSB taking the series after winning the opening match, 8-7, and the closing match, 7-3. The Gauchos lead the all-time series 119-101.</p>\n<p>The last four seasons the winner of the Blue-Green rival has been the host team, meaning this year the Mustangs holds that advantage.</p>\n<p>Combine that with the fact that the Gauchos have a losing record on the road, 4-5-1 to be exact, and it spells trouble for the young team. However, they are not fazed by the challenge awaiting them in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to think that we as a team are mature enough to not let something like being away from home be a factor.” Calica said.</p>\n<p>The challenge however, will not be easy as UCSB is taking on a Cal Poly team leads the conference in walks (157) and that ranks second in on-base percentage (.379), runs scored (172), and RBI (156).</p>\n<p>The team is led by the only two returning starters in junior catcher/first baseman Brett Barbier and senior outfielder Josh Schuknecht.</p>\n<p>Barbier leads the team in batting average (.384), hits (48), extra-base hits (13), slugging percentage (.536) and leads the conference in on-base percentage (.536). Schuknecht leads the team in RBI (28) and is second in home runs with three.</p>\n<p>“They will probably bat aggressive early.” Bieber said. “This is Big West play and all teams just want to come our strong but we will be ready defensively.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will also look to former Big West Player of the Week, freshman outfielder Alex McKenna, to help the team with the long ball as he has had five of them this season, a team high.</p>\n<p>However, Friday’s game will be a tough one for these batters as they will the newly named Big West Pitcher of the Week, Shane Bieber (7-1).</p>\n<p>Beiber received the honors after throwing a complete game shutout last Friday against CSUN and only allowing four hits throughout the contest.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool to have that honor.” Beiber said. “It helps that I think we got the best defense in the west coast backing me up because they make plays that allow me to go all nine.”</p>\n<p>This season the junior has the most wins of any pitcher in the Big West (7) and with a win this Friday will match his career high in wins. The right hander’s 2.74 ERA and 49 strikeouts both rank ninth in the conference among pitchers.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted the Gauchos have the best relieving pitcher in sophomore Kyle Nelson who has the best ERA in the Big West (1.23) and the best opposing batting average (.157).</p>\n<p>Not only will Cal Poly be worried about UCSB’s ability to pitch but also the slew of hitters they have at the helm.</p>\n<p>Leading off the Gauchos each game has been redshirt junior Andrew Calica who ranks first in the conference in walks (27) and second in on-base percentage (.487). The center-fielder currently leads the team in hits (34) and is fifth in batting average (.291).</p>\n<p>Other notable hitters include sophomore Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (24), redshirt sophomores Josh Adams and J.J Muno who both are tied for the team lead in home runs with four and redshirt junior Devon Gradford who leas the team in batting average (.370).</p>\n<p>This weekend will be all about the Gauchos trying to keep their first place standing as well as continually improving as it has each week. The historical season they are on cannot be squandered by looking ahead, the Gauchos need to stay vigilant and keep on playing the way they have which has resulted in 25 wins in 33 games.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is against their Green counterpart Cal Poly Friday April 22 at 6 p.m. at Baggett Stadium. The next two games are at the same place Saturday and Sunday at 6 and 1 p.m. respectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Emily Zhang /Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The fight had an initial date set for March 12 that had to be postponed due to Thurman suffering whiplash in a car accident. It will be the third title defense for the reigning champion and the first fight in the year 2016 for both fighters.</p>\n<p>Via <em>Boxrec.com</em>, the best of the best are set to step foot in the ring, with Thurman rated as the No. 1 boxer in the USA and No. 2 in the world. Porter is just one spot behind Thurman at No. 2 in the USA rankings and No. 5 in the world.</p>\n<p>Similar to their closeness in ratings, the tale of the tape displays a near identical resemblance between the two as both differ by just half an inch in height and reach.</p>\n<p>Yet separating the pair of boxers is the one loss on Porter’s record. At 26-1-1, Porter has the opportunity to put an end to Thurman’s undefeated 26-0-0 record.</p>\n<p>While the legendary hard-nosed, toe-to-toe boxing matches from decades past are no longer as pertinent as they once were, the possibility of either boxer falling to the canvas is certainly ideal.</p>\n<p>More likely to deliver this knockdown blow is Thurman, also known as ‘One Time’ for his punishing hits. A total of 81 percent of his victories have been earned by knockout.</p>\n<p>Most notably, just four of his career 26 fights have been decided by a unanimous decision, while his other 22 wins have all been decided by knockout.</p>\n<p>Although Porter has achieved just 57 percent of his wins by knockout, he is more of a strategic fighter who looks to break his opponents down over the duration of rounds as he seeks that finishing head or body shot.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, a unique technique within Porter’s finishing realm of punches is this lunging hook/haymaker that he commonly throws when in search of causing real damage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wybyegEKS78?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A similar calculated, disciplined approach can be identified in Thurman as well, but it is his more aggressive approach which has allowed him to become the knockout artist he has proven himself to be. It is evident that Thurman isn’t afraid to gamble at times and make himself appear vulnerable while hunting for that power punch to end a fight.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRSap9PsVOU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>While it is too early to decide on a definite corner to support, my mind is telling me to side with Thurman and the entertainment factor he presents while my heart believes in the hunger of Porter, who has not hoisted a championship belt since enduring his first loss to Kell Brook in defense of his IBF World Welterweight Title back on Aug. 16, 2014.</p>\n<p>A decision on who to side with may never appear, but the anticipation for the June 25 bout shall continue to surmount, as it has the potential to be one of the best fights in years to come as professional boxing transitions from one star to another.</p>\n<p><em>All stats according to Boxrec.com.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/","id":3298,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3297,3296,3295],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Welcome Cal and LBSU to Campus Diamond","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One game behind the .500 mark, the UCSB softball team will attempt to remain within the top of the Big West Conference standings as the Gauchos are schedules to face Cal this Wednesday and Long Beach ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In hopes of staying within the race of the Big West standings, an important week awaits the UCSB softball team.

It’s really just about getting back to playing clean softball,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “We’ve had a lot of different people step up who continue to get clutch performances.”</p>\n<p>The Golden Bears play with a powerful offense which consists of three standout players who together account for most of the team’s success. These players hold the top positions in the batting lineup, and are powerful hitters all around.</p>\n<p>Cal’s sophomore utility player Jazmyn Jackson will be a focus for the Gauchos’ pitching staff, as she holds the team’s highest batting average of .390. Jackson has scored a total of 26 runs this season on 57 total hits. She has also contributed seven doubles and 16 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Another key contributor for the Golden Bears is sophomore infielder Kobie Pettis. Pettis currently possesses a team-leading 26 RBIs this season. She has also slugged two home runs along with recording 10 doubles. Pettis also bats owns a .356 hitting clip and has a total of 15 runs scored this season off 42 hits.</p>\n<p>Despite her freshman status, Cal infielder Lindsay Rood has been a consistent force in the Golden Bears’ batting rotation, leading the team with 34 runs scored this season. She’s also registered a total of 20 RBIS, five doubles, two triples, and three home runs.</p>\n<p>Following two resting days between its contest versus Cal, UCSB will return to the field to face Long Beach State this Saturday.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have strengths in both hitting and pitching, making them an extremely versatile team and a tough opponent. Junior starting pitcher Christina Clermont is sure to see the mound this weekend as she has established her presence with a 14-7 record while tossing a total of 142.2 innings this season while accumulating a 2.11 ERA. Clermont has given up 43 earned runs, and has recorded a solid 144 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Complementing LBSU’s pitching will be its performance at the plate as well. Senior third baseman Darian Tautalafua has dominated Big West play, earning Player of the Week after hitting 4 home runs in Long Beach’s series’ victory last weekend against UC Davis. Tautalafua leads her team in almost every offensive category. She has slugged 12 home runs this season, along with six doubles and one triple. Nonetheless, her abilities at-bat are phenomenal as she bolsters 44 RBIs and has notched an on-base percentage of .421.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Nichole Fry has also made moves this season, and serves as a secret weapon for the 49ers. Although she holds a lower spot in the batting lineup, she has tallied a total of 26 runs scored this season and seven doubles, all while holding just a .250 average.</p>\n<p>In hopes of returning to its playing form in which it began the season with, UCSB will be led by the veteran talent of senior infielder Arianna Palomares. She is currently second on the team in runs scored with 25 and has 26 RBIs this season.</p>\n<p>“We just need to play together. We’ve seen glimpses of the best that we can do, but it’s going to take all of us being on at the same time and really clicking,” said Palomares.</p>\n<p>Freshman second baseman Seirra Altmeyer continues to prove her talents among the lineup as well. Altmeyer leads with 30 RBIs and 12 doubles this season. She also holds an on-base percentage of .383, while contributing 15 runs scored off of 37 hits.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow and freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin will be sure to split the Gauchos upcoming games. Ludlow has provided 130 innings of pitching this season, while giving up 53 earned runs and striking out 127 batters. Gulvin has also provided 95 solid innings while giving up 47 earned runs and striking out 58 batters.<br>\nThe Gauchos will take on the Cal Golden Bears at 2 p.m. this Wednesday, April 20. On Saturday, April 23, UCSB will play Long Beach State at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. The final game of the series will take place on Sunday, April 24 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/","id":49,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[48,47,46],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":79,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
