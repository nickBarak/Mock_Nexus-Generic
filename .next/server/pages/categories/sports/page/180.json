We want to win.”</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason polls, UCSB was predicted to finish second, right behind conference foe Cal Poly. The two teams received the same number of first place votes, but Cal Poly received more points overall.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos weren’t thinking about the polls. They were concerned with adjusting and readying themselves for conference play. Their preseason schedule included some stiff competition, such as St. Mary’s and Washington State.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a great schedule,” Johnson said. “It was tough and it prepared us for conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began conference on the road, facing rival Cal Poly first. As expected, the game went down to the wire. A three-point play by senior guard Ashlee Burns with 2.3 seconds remaining left the Gauchos winless to start conference for only the second time in the last 17 seasons.</p>\n<p>A week later, Mitchell earned her first conference win as head coach against Cal State Fullerton 39-37, although it wasn’t the Gauchos’ best showing.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing that hasn’t changed for the Gauchos this season, it’s their tenacious defense. UCSB allows opponents a mere 49.6 points per game, the best in the Big West and seventh in the nation. In eight of their past 10 games, their opponent hasn’t scored over 50 points. Furthermore, the Gauchos have held their opposition to 37 percent shooting, also first in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to try to outscore teams, but we’re going to try to make it hard on opponents on the defensive end,” Mitchell said. “That’s what I’m about and that’s what this program is about. We have to control what we can, which is defensive intensity.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, there is no apparent leader for UCSB. Certainly no player will be found atop the Big West rankings, but that is Mitchell’s strategy on offense: balance. UCSB has a deep team with many players who can make a difference.</p>\n<p>“Every player should have the confidence to be the go-to player if we need them to,” Mitchell said. “Then teams can’t focus on one player.”</p>\n<p>Currently, junior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team in scoring at 8.9 points per game. She is also second on the squad in rebounding at 7.8 per game, placing her sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets] has that ability to get a double-double every night,” Mitchell said. “Sweets understands we’re not asking too much for her and her athleticism.”</p>\n<p>While Johnson, who played for Team USA in October, has been inconsistent in finding her shooting touch thus far, she continues to lead her team by doing the less noticed things, like distributing the ball and getting steals. She leads the team in both categories with 2.8 assists and 1.2 steals per contest, while still averaging 8.4 points.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Emilie] has to score for this team to be successful,” Mitchell said. “She’s such an unselfish player, and she understands it’s important to be a distributor and set the tempo. If she has five or six assists, that means 10 or 12 points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s other senior and captain, Kelsey Adrian, has recently found her stride in the new system, especially from behind the arc. The guard shoots 42.6 percent from three point land, good enough for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The two sophomore guards Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig have also proved themselves as offensive threats, averaging 8.6 and 8.2 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a good mix [of players],” Adrian said. “ We have some super athletic players and some shooters. We’re really complimentary of each other. We’re not as big as other teams, but we’re bigger and have bigger basketball IQs.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Kirsten Tilleman cleans up the paint under the hoop night in and night out. She ranks second in rebounds in the Big West at 8.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“[Kirsten] is instrumental to our success so far,” Mitchell said. “She has to guard the other teams’ tallest and most physical players. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the effort and intensity every night.”</p>\n<p>As Coach Mitchell has preached all year, it most likely will be the little things that determine the Gauchos’ run for a title. Defense is their bread and butter, but rebounding and turnovers may make the difference.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding and limiting turnovers have been our keys all year long,” Adrian said. “We’re smaller, so blocking out is going to win or lose us games.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, Santa Barbara’s weakness seems to be consistent offensive production as they continue to work on executing on the offensive end. As a result, they score the least in conference at 51.1 points per game, but overall they still maintain the greatest scoring margin (+1.5).</p>\n<p>“We emphasize [defense],” Johnson said. “That’s been our identity: our toughness on that end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host UC Riverside this Saturday in the Thunderdome at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball went 3-9 and lost seven consecutive games entering conference play. They opened conference with two straight wins. The lesson: last year’s Big West co-champions and this year’s predicted league champs by the preseason polls should never be counted out of the mix.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited and honored to be selected to win it, but we know we’re a long way off of that and know we have to earn it every single day,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “We had some really good competition in preseason and I think it’s prepared us all for the great competition we’re going to face in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs lost last year’s Big West Player of the Year, Rachel Clancy, they return with arguably an even more dangerous threat. Redshirt senior and 2009-10 Big West Player of the Year Kristina Santiago, who missed last year with a torn ACL, is back in action. Against San Diego State on Dec. 21, Santiago made the bold statement that she is completely back, tallying a career high 44 points.</p>\n<p>“We definitely have a different team, [which is] trying to put it together so we can have as successful a year,” Mimnaugh said. “Santiago is obviously one of the main reasons for that success. She is by all accounts an all-star and somebody that I’m sure the WNBA is having a really close look at as far as an addition to their league.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, the 6’1’’ forward has averaged 24 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Both statistics are good enough to lead the Big West and nationally rank her fifth and 17th, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Ashlee Burns is Cal Poly’s third leading scorer at 8.8 points per game. Opponents should watch out for her three-point shooting; she averages 36.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Ashlee Burns has been a terrific three-point shooter and somebody we count on to extend the defense so they can’t completely collapse on Kristina,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Mustangs are extremely strong offensively, preferring high scoring games. They lead the Big West, averaging 72.1 points per outing. The also lead the league in field goal percentage (42 percent) and assists (14.4).</p>\n<p>“We love up-tempo,” Mimnaugh said. “If we can score in the 70s, we’re usually on the victory side.”</p>\n<p>Consequently, Cal Poly also allows their opponents the most points in the Big West, so their game plan is simple: outscore the other team.</p>\n<p><strong>Pacific: Tigers</strong></p>\n<p>The University of the Pacific was picked to finish eighth in the Big West in the Preseason Media Poll, but already has almost as many wins as they did all of last year. The Tigers went 5-11 in conference play last season (9-22 overall) and entered the Big West Tournament as the seventh seed. There, they upset second seed UCSB in the first round before falling to first seed Cal Poly in the second round.</p>\n<p>This season, Pacific is currently in third place in the conference at 2-1 (8-6 overall). The Tigers went 6-5 through a tough nonconference schedule, including a trip to second-ranked Connecticut, and feel they are prepared for Big West play.</p>\n<p>“Now we get into the rhythm of conference play,” Head Coach Lynne Roberts told pacifictigers.com. “The Big West is going to be a close race. We know [each game is] going to be very tough.”</p>\n<p>In its first conference game against Cal State Fullerton on Dec. 29, Pacific won 72-67. In its next showing on Jan. 5 at UC Irvine, the Tigers lost in overtime, 77-75, but rebounded with a big win on Jan. 7, 80-59 at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Early in the season, there were indications that the Tigers were on track for an improvement from last year. On Dec. 5, junior guard Erica McKenzie was named Big West Player of the Week, and on Dec. 12, junior guard Ashley Wakefield earned the same award. McKenzie averages 12.4 points per game, and Wakefield is the team’s leading scorer at 12.6 points per game. On the defensive side, sophomore guard Gena Johnson is third in the conference in blocked shots with 1.4 per game.</p>\n<p>One area Pacific has found success is from behind the arc. McKenzie has made a conference-leading 34 three-pointers thus far this season, and junior Kendall Rodriguez leads the conference in individual three-point field goal percentage with .440. Overall, the team has the second-best three-point field goal percentage in the Big West with .344.</p>\n<p>Roberts hopes that the team can sustain these areas of success, which have contributed to its exceeding expectations so far.</p>\n<p>“Our focus now is making sure our players understand we have momentum, but we’re not where we want to be yet,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team enters the season as defending champions of the Big West conference, after making a run in the conference tournament as a fourth seed and losing to Stanford in the first round of the NCAA tournament. With new Head Coach Jennifer Gross at the helm, the Aggies have started the season 8-5 overall and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After replacing 14-year Head Coach Sandy Simpson, who went 24-9 overall and 10-6 in conference in his final season, new Head Coach Jennifer Gross is trying to bring a fast, up-tempo offense to the team, as well as a tough and physical mentality to both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“Although I am in my first year as the head coach at UC Davis, I have been a part of this Aggie program for the past eight years,” Gross said. “Of course, I have my own style as the head coach, but the overall philosophy of our program will remain the same.”</p>\n<p>This season the Aggies are led by their three senior captains. Senior guard Samantha Meggison started all 33 games last season, leading the team in steals with 61 and finishing second on the team with 66 assists. Meggison is leading the Aggies in points with 10.8 points per game and rebounds (4.5). Senior guard Hana Asano is averaging seven points and 3.5 assists per game. Senior forward Kasey Riecks is second on the team, with 10.2 points per game and is on pace to become the 15th Aggie to reach 1,000 career points.</p>\n<p>“Three of our seniors, Samantha Meggison, Kasey Riecks and Hana Asano have been very consistent so far,” Gross said. “Whether it is scoring, rebounding or getting us stops, they have been providing great leadership and have been very productive on the court.”</p>\n<p>After five straight wins to start the season, the Aggies have cooled off and are now 8-5 and 0-1 in conference. Davis is averaging 62.9 points per game, ranking sixth in the conference in offense, including a league-leading 7.6 threes per game, ranking them 14th in all of Division I. Defensively, they are only giving up 63.6 points to their opponents, forcing 19.9 turnovers a game.</p>\n<p>Gross is focused this year on building strong relations and competing as a unit, fielding a team that can be competitive night in and night out in a very even conference that is up for grabs. The Aggies’ goal for the season is to continue growing throughout the next few months and coming as close as possible to reaching their potential.</p>\n<p>“We have big picture goals like trying to go back to the NCAA tournament,” Riecks said. “But there’s a lot of goals within our team that we want to accomplish through each game, and its getting better every game, and the opportunity that we have to be on the court during practice is amazing.”</p>\n<p><strong>CSUN: Matadors</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team has already seen success this season, sitting at 8-7 overall and 3-0 in the Big West. Last year, the Matadors suffered through a 4-26 overall (4-11 Big West) season. Thus far, Northridge has defeated Irvine, Riverside and Long Beach to stand in first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Matadors are led by senior center Jasmine Erving, who averages 14.7 points per game and has started all 15 games so far, alongside freshman guard Ashlee Guay.</p>\n<p>Erving earned herself the Big West Player of the Week award the week of Nov. 28. She posted two consecutive double-doubles against Colgate and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 2, freshman guard Janae Sharpe also took home the Big West Player of the Week award, bringing CSUN women’s basketball its second of the season. Sharpe scored 19 points and had seven steals against UC Irvine, leading Northridge to its first league win of the season.</p>\n<p>In steals, Northridge only ranks behind Long Beach this season, partly due to freshman guard Ashlee Guay, who leads the team with 55. She and Sharpe, who has 29 steals, get the ball back for their offense and feed leading scorer Erving. Both Guay and Sharpe have 57 and 36 assists respectively.</p>\n<p>Northridge will face Pacific on the road and Cal Poly at home before facing Santa Barbara at home on Jan. 21.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>After posting a 6-5 nonconference record, Fullerton has opened its Big West season by going 1-3.</p>\n<p>The Titans lost a close game at Pacific in its Big West opener 72-67, despite a fourth consecutive 20-point effort from senior guard Megan Richardson. Fullerton then upset UC Davis 58-50 two days later, and returned home 1-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>In the team’s home opener, four different Titans tallied double digit points, but Cal Poly won 76-69. On Saturday, Fullerton played host to visiting UCSB, who escaped with a narrow 39-37 victory.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Marcia Foster will be patrolling the sidelines in her third season with Fullerton, who a year after posting a 9-21 (5-11 Big West) overall record, was tabbed to finish fifth in the Conference Preseason Media Poll.</p>\n<p>Richardson was named to the preseason All-Conference team and is the squad’s returning leader in minutes per game (32) and points (14.7). Other returning starters include redshirt senior point guard Lauren Chow and sophomore guard Alex Thomas.</p>\n<p>An indication of Fullerton’s success may be how the team fares away from the friendly confines of Titan Gym. Last year, Fullerton was 3-14 on the road, including 2-6 in the Big West.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43526\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43526\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/","id":790,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[789,788,787],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UC Santa Barbara: Gauchos With lofty expectations set for conference play, the UCSB men’s basketball team is off to a hot start after winning its first two Big West games.

Because of the team’s recent success, UCSB began this year on much of the country’s radar, receiving votes in the season’s first mid-major poll. Additionally, the Gauchos will be featured on national television as many as seven times during this regular season.</p>\n<p>While recognition on the national scene is nice, it all comes down to conference play for the Gauchos. UCSB received four first-place votes and was picked to finish second in the Big West in the annual preseason media poll released by the conference. Long Beach State (10-6, 3-0), whom the Gauchos beat in the Big West tournament championship in each of the past two seasons, was picked to win the conference.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really put any stock into these preseason ranking and awards,” Williams said. “It is all about being hungry, staying within yourself as you grow during the year you have a chance to achieve. We are highly motivated.”</p>\n<p>Facing Fullerton (10-5, 2-2) in the team’s home opener, UCSB got off to a slow start but behind solid defense, was able to coast to a 77-64 victory. In the team’s Big West opener on the road at Cal Poly (10-6, 1-2) last week, senior standout guard Orlando Johnson’s three-pointer miraculously bounced in with five seconds left to give the Gauchos a one point lead and decisive advantage. The win gave Williams, who is in his 14th season as head coach of the Gauchos, his 223rd career win.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to make a statement on the road against a good Cal Poly squad to start off</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t exactly how we pictured it,” Williams said of Johnson’s bouncing three-pointer. “We were hoping to get Orlando going to the rim, but the defense forced him outside, and that was that…”</p>\n<p>With a preseason John R. Wodden Award, preseason Top 50 and Lute Olson Preseason All-American, Johnson leads the Gauchos with 20.4 points per game — good for first place in the Big West and 13th in the nation. After transferring from Loyola Marymount, the 6-foot-5 player was named the Big West MVP as a sophomore two</p>\n<p>seasons ago, and has led the league in scoring each of the past two seasons (including a Gaucho single-season record of 674 points last season).</p>\n<p>Johnson and Nunnally (16.5 points per game, fourth in the Big West) — both of whom were selected to the Preseason Big West All-Conference Team — form the best 1-2 scoring punch in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It helps us a lot,” Johnson said of he and Nunnally. “We are similar in a lot of ways — athletic, long, shoot the ball well … When one of us has an off-night, the other one is usually there to pick up the scoring slack. It’s something that other teams have to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s third returning senior starter is forward Jaime Serna. An All-Big West Tournament pick a year ago, Serna is currently third in the nation with a .692 field goal percentage while averaging 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I would certainly like to see Jaime get more shots up,” Williams said. “He is unbelievably productive, and when he’s active he is the best big man in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>Mixed in with the experienced veterans are two key transfers and several freshmen that will be asked to make an immediate impact for the squad. Junior guard Keegan Hornbuckle, a transfer from Colorado, has come on strong as of late after returning from an early season injury. Junior guard Nate Garth, who was forced to sit out last season after transferring from New Mexico, has started nine games for the Gauchos, averaging 2.6 assists per game, as he and freshman point guard T.J. Taylor have split time at point guard.</p>\n<p>UCSB currently has an influx of youth on its bench, with seven freshmen on its roster. Coach Williams will decide which will redshirt as the season continues, as four have played so far on the season.</p>\n<p>“They have all acclimated pretty well,” Williams said of his freshmen. “They will all have to be big contributors for us at some point.”</p>\n<p>Nine different players have started a game for the Gauchos in this young season, and Coach Williams has no plans of slowing down his lineup changes. Based on the opponent and style of play desired, UCSB will continue to thrive on versatility, tweaking lineups to capitalize on advantages.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” senior guard Christian Peterson said. “We are a very versatile team.”</p>\n<p>Last season, in its quest to continue as regular season league champions, UCSB struggled in conference play and limped into the Big West tournament as a fifth seed. An improbable run to win the tournament sent the Gauchos back to the NCAA Tourney, becoming the lowest seed to do so since 1996. Despite a positive end result, UCSB is more focused this season.</p>\n<p>“We have learned from past experiences,” Williams said. “Off the court manifested on the court, and we weren’t cohesive or physically aggressive. It is all about how you continue to grow and improve as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opened up the season on fire, winning its first four games as part of a six-game stretch in November at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>However, arguably the team’s two toughest nonconference opponents yet were due into Santa Barbara next. On Nov. 26, UCSB suffered its first loss of the season in an overtime thriller to No. 25 San Diego State, a team that is slated to become a member of the Big West conference beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>Four days later, another ranked opponent — this time, No. 17 UNLV (15-2) strolled into Santa Barbara fresh off a win over No. 1 over North Carolina. With the rowdy Thunderdome home crowd behind them, the Gauchos battled all game behind Johnson’s 36 points and 10 rebounds, but eventually lost 94-88 in double overtime after a buzzer-beater tip-in from senior center Greg Somogyi forced overtime, and then a UNLV buzzer-beater three-pointer forced a second extra period.</p>\n<p>“It’s just tough to swallow games like that,” Johnson said. “We will just build on it, that’s all we can do.”</p>\n<p>With a 4-2 record in its pocket, the UCSB squad hit the road at the beginning of December for a four game 12-day road trip with games at USD, UWash, UC Berkeley and BYU — teams with a combined record of 41-24.</p>\n<p>“It was a great time for a road trip, right after finals. We love going on the road during that time of the year,” Williams explained. “It is a building and bonding time for the team.”</p>\n<p>The trip began positively after the Gauchos bested San Diego 65-61. Three days later at Washington, 24 points and 10 rebounds from Johnson was not enough as the Gauchos ran out of gas late, falling 87-80 to the Huskies. At Cal (12-3), UCSB struggled mightily in its most lopsided game of the year, falling to the Bears 70-50. UCSB ended its road trip with another close loss against a tough opponent in BYU (12-4). The Gauchos fought hard but were unable to pull the game to closer than seven late in the second half, as a season-high 19 turnovers limited the team’s opportunities.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this team knows it all comes down to conference play, and will use its tough nonconference schedule to learn and grow as a cohesive unit.</p>\n<p>“We are still evolving as a team,” Williams explained. “We are still trying to find ourselves in terms of our identity, but going forward we will have to be a team that doesn’t turn the ball over, defends hard and plays very unselfish. If we get those three things going, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Aware of what is at stake, the Gauchos are focused and grounded headed forward.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to just take it one game at a time and get better consistently,” Johnson said. “We want to put ourselves in the best situations and make sure we are on the right path to where we want to go … With the group we have I think will do a good job to not let this season take a bad turn … We want to make this year special, and be a Cinderella team.”</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State: 49ers</strong></p>\n<p>As the reigning No. 2 team in the conference for back-to-back seasons, it may have seemed surprising that Long Beach State would be ranked pre-season No. 1 in the conference. However with four out of five starters returning — including last season’s Player of the Year senior guard Casper Ware — the 49ers will bring back more experienced leaders than any other team in the league.</p>\n<p>“A lot of veterans have been through a lot of different parts of seasons, good and bad,” Head Coach Dan Monson said. “And we’ve had a lot of both. They’ve changed the Long Beach State program.”</p>\n<p>Forward T.J. Robinson, guard Larry Anderson and forward Eugene Phelps each received All-Big West honors last season, and join Ware as the core of the 49ers squad.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s preseason schedule this year was not only one of the toughest for a Big West team, but one of the most challenging in the nation amongst Division I schools. The 49ers faced perennial powerhouses North Carolina, Kansas, Louisville, San Diego State, Xavier and Pittsburgh, all of which made it to the NCAA tournament last March. CSULB was able to upset Pittsburgh and Xavier, each by a 10-point margin. For Monson, the rigorous preseason schedule is another step toward the goal of improvement.</p>\n<p>“My philosophy is that the preseason is to get yourself ready for the season,” Monson said. “It’s really hard for players or teams to know how good they are unless they play good teams.”</p>\n<p>CSULB is thus far undefeated through its first three games of Big West play after beating UC Irvine 74-60 on the road, Cal Poly 55-50 at home, then Cal State Northridge 81-68 at Northridge. Robinson currently averages a double-double with 12.5 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Ware ranks third in the league in scoring with 16.6 points per game, the highest average of any 49er.</p>\n<p>In each of its Big West championship appearances during the past two years, CSULB has suffered a defeat to UC Santa Barbara. With the return of four experienced seniors this season, Monson hopes to continue playing through March for the first time since 2007.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just losing to Santa Barbara … we didn’t play well in the [Big West] tournament,” Monson said. “[This year] we have the opportunity to compete for a championship.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>Projected to finish fourth in the preseason Big West conference poll, Cal State Fullerton is off to an impressive start in the 2011-12 basketball season, compiling a 10-5 record (2-2 Big West).</p>\n<p>The Titans, who finished sixth in the Big West last season with a 11-20 record (7-9 in the conference) are headlined by a trio of incoming transfers who have boosted the talent of the team tremendously.</p>\n<p>“It’s been terrific, I don’t know if I’ve ever had a team that gets along as well as these kids do,” nine-year Head Coach Bob Burton said. “They blend in very well; that was the difference of us winning 11 games last year and having 10 already at the halfway point. The difference has been the transfers.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Omondi Amoke, a transfer from UC Berkeley, has led the Titans in rebounding with 8.5 boards per game, good for second in the Big West. Amoke also ranks fourth on the team in scoring, averaging 11.5 points a game.</p>\n<p>“He’s not only given us good scoring, rebounding and defense, but a lot of leadership too,” Burton said. “The kids have appointed him the captain of the team unanimously.”</p>\n<p>Pacing the highest-scoring offense in the Big West have been a pair of junior guards in Kwame Vaughn and D.J. Seeley, transfers from San Francisco and Berkeley, respectively. Vaughn is second on the team with 15.3 points per game and leads Fullerton with over four assists a contest. Seeley meanwhile is the team’s leading scorer at 15.5 points a game on the season.</p>\n<p>Fullerton used a seven-game winning streak, the last two of which were in conference, to come into Big West play strong before dropping tightly contested matchups to UCSB and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We actually lost a couple of games I thought we should have won, but all in all I’m really happy with the preseason we had,” Burton said. “Starting 2-0 in league has really been great for us.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the starting five for the Titans are sophomore guard Isiah Umipig and senior forward Orane Chin, the most veteran player on Fullerton’s roster.</p>\n<p>Burton envisions his team playing tough down the stretch and competing for a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s feasible, but it’s going to be very difficult,” Burton said. “Obviously Long Beach and Santa Barbara are the two dominant teams in the league. I think in this league anything can happen. I think we have the capability to do it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Touting the Big West’s top defense in points allowed per game, Cal Poly currently holds a 10-6 record (1-2 in conference) entering the second week of conference play.</p>\n<p>Finishing last season second in the Big West at 15-15 (10-6 conference), the Mustangs were picked to finish third in the preseason conference poll.</p>\n<p>“Our number one goal: keep improving,” three-year Head Coach Joe Callero said. “If we keep improving, we feel like we have enough talent this year that we can be competitive and we have a chance to win the postseason tournament and get to the big dance.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Mustangs is senior forward David Hanson, a preseason Big West first team selection after garnering second team honors last year. Hanson currently leads Cal Poly in scoring at 10.9 points a game, while second on the team in rebounds, averaging over five a game.</p>\n<p>“The best part about David is that he is such a calm and confident guy,” Callero said. “He brings not just great play, but a great maturity and great poise, and that’s what you rely on out of your seniors.”</p>\n<p>While securing impressive road victories over Fresno State and USC, the Mustangs have fallen short against a number of top teams including two five-point losses to both DePaul and St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>“We had five or six games against good if not great teams,” Callero said. “I think it has prepared us well. I think a lot of teams in the conference have played really good preseason games.”</p>\n<p>Conference play meanwhile has been cruel to Cal Poly with a 55-50 loss at Long Beach and a 58-57 defeat from UCSB at the hands of an Orlando Johnson last second three-pointer.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs rebounded with a win over Fullerton on Saturday for their first conference victory.</p>\n<p>“I think we would have liked the bounces to have gone a little bit better,” Callero said in reference to Johnson’s winning shot. “That always hurts. You win some games that way and you lose some games that way. The first two games we played very well, we just got pinched in the last minute of the game.”</p>\n<p>Playing important roles for the Mustangs this season are a pair of senior transfers from Hagerstown College in forward Will Taylor and point guard Amaurys Fermin. Both were eligible to play last season but were redshirted due to academic and health issues.</p>\n<p>Taylor is fourth in the conference with a team-high 7.8 rebounds per game while averaging better than 10 points a contest. Fermin meanwhile also averages over 10 points and is second in the conference with four assists per game.</p>\n<p>“It gives us a really true experienced point guard in Fermin and gives us another real aggressive rebounder and post up player [in Taylor],” Callero said. “They played junior college together so they have very good team chemistry too. They really know how to play well together.”</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside: Highlanders</strong></p>\n<p>There are few teams in the Big West playing as well as the UC Riverside Highlanders are right now. After stumbling out of the gates to a 1-4 start, they have won six of their last 10 games and sport a 7-8 (1-1 in conference) record early on in the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think we got off guard a little bit,” Head Coach Jim Wooldridge said. “I think we all felt that since we had a number of returning players that we would have a better identity early on. We got humbled a bit, and then we started to realize what we had to do to be a better team.”</p>\n<p>Like most coaches, Wooldridge pays little mind to preseason rankings. He knows that his team will face stiff completion from the rest of the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We knew coming into the season that Santa Barbara and Long Beach were the two best teams in the league, and then from there it is a mixture of teams,” Wooldridge said.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are lead by a pair of senior guards, Phil Martin and Kareem Nitoto, who lead the team in most statistical categories. They stand out most, however, in their contribution to the team’s offensive output. Martin leads the team with a whopping 242 points, 16.1 per game, and Nitoto is second with 151 points (10.1 per game). In comparison, the third highest scorer on the team has put up just 83 points.</p>\n<p>“They are critical to our success,” Wooldridge said. “If you look at our scoring, we’re somewhat limited in that department. If those guys play well offensively then it really gives us a chance to win ball games. We don’t have a whole lot of other options currently, so we have to rely on both of those guys to play that role for us.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have lately reaped the benefits of junior guard Robert Smith, who transferred from Santa Clara this season and had to sit out the first several games due to the NCAA’s transfer rules. Even with the missed time he has put up nine points per game for a total of 72 points.</p>\n<p>“He’s changed our team,” Wooldridge said. “He’s helped us win a few ball games at home and on the road. He’s a talented young man. He’s brought a level of confidence to the other players on our team, because they know that they can rely on him to make plays.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders’ real strength, however, lies on the defensive side of the ball. They lead their opponents in steals and blocks per game and are +0.1 in the turnover margin. In order to succeed in a competitive Big West, they will need to continue their strong defensive play.</p>\n<p>“Well the numbers look pretty good right now,” Wooldridge said. “I think we can play better defense. I think that’s going to be the staple of this team. It is the only way we can consistently win ball games.”</p>\n<p>Though 1-1 is only a so-so start to the conference portion of their schedule, the Highlanders have the potential to contend for a Big West title. They enter conference competition playing well, and, with players like Martin, Nitoto and Smith leading the way, they have to potential to be a force to be reckoned with in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Defensively, [we need to] finish possessions get defensive rebounds [and not] allow second chance opportunities to creep into the ball game,” Wooldridge said. “Offensively, when we’ve been successful, we’ve had good balance; we’ve moved the ball; we share the ball; we get the ball into the lane.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are coming off a two-game road win streak and will now head home to do battle with UCSB and Cal Poly. Both are teams they must beat in order to contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis men’s basketball team enters its fifth season in the Big West conference after finishing last season at the bottom of the conference table, finishing 10-20 overall and 4-12 in conference play. Led by new head coach, Jim Les, the Aggies have started this season on a nine-game losing streak, going 1-12 and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After coming off their worst season since entering the Big West conference, Les has the task of replacing most of its offense from last season including its top two scorers in Mark Payne and Joe Harden, as well as losing 49.5 percent of their assists and 48.9 percent in steals. With only two seniors on the team, the Aggies have struggled in finding consistency so far in the season.</p>\n<p>“Right now we’ve been inconsistent with the guys we need to step up,” Les said. “We’re searching for answers in terms of guys that can replace that productivity. We need multiple guys to step up and play, and be more productive for us.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for the Aggies this season will be senior guard Eddie Miller who started all 30 games last season and finished second on the team in total steals (32) and third in scoring (12.5). Last year’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year, sophomore guard/forward Josh Ritchart is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 12.2 points per game and is team leader in blocks with 10.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will have to replace junior guard Ryan Sypkens who, before going down with a knee injury for the season was averaging 14.5 points per game. Head coach’s son, sophomore guard Tyler Les also appears to play a prominent role in the offense. Last year Les played in 25 games and shot 50 percent from behind the arc and is second in the league in three pointers (2.75).</p>\n<p>“[Tyler] is getting more playing time and he’s in a system and culture he’s comfortable with, and that’s allowing him to step up and produce,” Les said. “He’s a young player, he needs to continue to grow and get better. His work ethic in practice every day is allowing him to have success on game night.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies have had a rough start to the season where they have lost their last nine games including their first conference match against Cal State Fullerton. Davis’ offense ranks eighth in the conference with 62.5 points per game and are last in defense giving up 75.9 points per game, averaging 15.9 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>In his first year at UC Davis, Head Coach Les is trying to bring enthusiasm and relevance to the program by bringing in an up tempo and high scoring offense to the team, which is ranked second in the conference in three point field goal percentage (36.5), but has struggled in bringing in a tough, physical defensive mentality to the team.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten off to a rough start but I think we’ve made some strides,” Tyler Les said. “Defensively there’s a lot more intensity, a lot of ball pressure, it’s definitely helping us individually and as a team. If we play hard and bring it every night we should be at the top of the conference.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/","id":788,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[787,786,785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tuesday Ballin’ With Ed. and Ed.: Sports Editors Pella & Porush Tackle Some Early Season NBA Headlines","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Good Lo’dy wo’dy / I just took more shots than Kobe” Big Sean didn’t need to search too far to find a metaphor with the word ‘shot’ involved.

Bryant has taken 230 shots through 10 games so far this season, and averages a Jordanesque 23 attempts per game.

Kobe took 23 shots during the game, connected on 11 and finished with 28 points in the one-point defeat. The squad’s second game was a loss against the Kings, in which Kobe took 24 shots, connected on 10 and tallied 29 points.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played organized basketball you may have heard some variation of the phrase, ‘You can’t make it unless you take it.’ I think I’ve found Bryant’s next tattoo.</p>\n<p>The Lakers followed their two-game losing streak with three consecutive wins, in all of which the Mamba took less than 20 shots.</p>\n<p>The first 10 games of this season have shown that if Kobe keeps his shot attempts under 20, the Lakers will win. That doesn’t mean he needs to hold back on his shooting or even limit his shots per game for the rest of the year. However, it does mean that there are certain techniques and plays the Lakers use during these games that, if recognized, would benefit them in future matchups. Whether that means passing out of a baseline double-team instead of opting for the fall-away, or finding new options out of Mike Brown’s offense [Bynum went for 21 points and 22 rebounds against Houston!], there is a solution, and it doesn’t have to be Kobe slowing down.</p>\n<p>This year’s outcome of a shortened NBA season would without a doubt be different if the full schedule was put in place in November. The effects of 66 games as opposed to 82 this year are daunting to say the least, and will be made apparent throughout the year leading into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>1) Sixty-six games will be played over the course of just four months. That’s approximately one game every other day, three to four games per week. Combined with the exhaustion of travel and practice on off-days, this season will prove to be one of the most challenging for many players. Age will be a huge contributing factor toward the success of teams. The Oklahoma City Thunder are the youngest squad in the league, with an average age of just over 24 years old. They’ll be able to respond physically to the demands of the season, while veteran teams such as the Celtics or the defending champion Mavericks will have a harder time adapting to the rigors of this year. Think about this: Dallas and Boston rank No. 1 and 2 in oldest teams in the NBA, based on average player age.</p>\n<p>2) Come playoff time, seeds won’t matter. It’ll seem like March Madness, where any team can be upset at any time. Look at the 1999 season, which was cut to 50 games because of a lockout. The No. 8 seeded Knicks made it all the way to the championship. Because of this year’s shortened season, teams will not be able to gain as much experience of playing out-of-conference foes, and thus will be less prepared, setting the foundation for upsets across the league.</p>\n<p>3) Rookies drafted in last summer’s draft didn’t have the opportunity for fall workouts with their team or their new coaches, which severely limits them during this first part of the season. Teams that would normally be relying on their new rookie talent, such as Kyrie Irving at Cleveland, will be hurting as their rookies may need more time to adapt to the NBA. If a team is reliant on their rookie class, they may need to use this shortened season as a learning tool for next year.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>sports editor Brent Pella wonders how many shots Big Sean has really taken this season.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/","id":820,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[819,818,817],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tuesday Ballin’ With Ed. and Ed.: Sports Editors Pella & Porush Tackle Some Early Season NBA Headlines","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Thunder & Lightning The Oklahoma City Thunder have gotten off to the fast start we expected, but at 8-2 the Thunder may be even better than advertised.

Kevin Durant is continuing to grow and improve, which is saying something when you are already the two-time defending scoring champion. James Harden is in the midst of a breakout year, and has morphed into Oklahoma City’s third best player and a spark-plug off the bench — the ‘Lamar Odom of the Thunder,’ if you will.

The offensive-minded Westbrook needs to learn how to be effective as a game manager and pass-first point guard. He doesn’t need to transform himself, just be able to recognize when he should facilitate and feed the ball to Durant every time down the floor. Not impossible, right?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Welcome to Lob City</strong></p>\n<p>And so the tale is told … David Stern, in his customary tyrannical grandeur and douchebag-ness, declared that the mighty Lakers could not acquire the treasure, and he disallowed the exchange. The one whom they call Chris Paul was stuck in purgatory, but a new land was to arise out of the ashes of controversy.</p>\n<p>LOB CITY was born!</p>\n<p>The Clippers are 4-2 so far, and have looked both like one of the best teams at times and one of the worst at others. It would seem that this inconsistency stems from adding three (Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups and Caron Butler) of the team’s six most important players to the mix during this shortened offseason. These inconsistencies would be more likely to disappear if Vinny Del Negro weren’t the head coach.</p>\n<p>Either way, CP3 needs to shoot the ball more and be more aggressive as a scorer offensively. Blake Griffin needs to keep doing his thing. DeAndre Jordan needs consistency. Billups needs humility (he is no longer a volume shooter, but a three-point shooting veteran presence at this stage in his career). And Vinny Del Negro needs a new haircut.</p>\n<p>Like a 40-year-old hippie wandering through the Coachella desert on acid, this team is still finding itself. Mainly, the Clippers need to learn how to win. Close-game experience in situations that actually matter, despite being virtually nonexistent in Clipper history, can’t be accurately replicated in practice. It comes with familiarity.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>sports editor Ryan Porush is tellin’ people what they need like he’s in the ‘Wizard of Oz’ or some shit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43422\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43422\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/","id":824,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[823,822,821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Top CSF 77-64, Improve to 2-0 Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team captured its second straight Big West win in the Thunderdome last Thursday night, beating visiting Cal State Fullerton 77-64 in the team’s conference home opener.

We aren’t going to play as fast, but have advantages inside and on the glass.”</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a sluggish start offensively in the first half, though their defense remained stout. The Gauchos took an 18-16 lead on a three-pointer from sophomore forward Keegan Hornbuckle. The shot sparked an 11-0 run for the Gauchos and they entered halftime leading 35-21.</p>\n<p>Fullerton battled to come back to a 52-43 score with under 10 minutes left in the second half, but the Gauchos responded. An alley-oop dunk from junior point guard Nate Garth to senior center Greg Somogyi ended that Titan run and put the Gauchos back in control. Up by eight points with just over a minute left, it was Johnson’s turn to ward off a Titan run with six consecutive free throws (10-of-11 on the night). The Gauchos’ lead never dipped below eight as they secured the win 77-64.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” Peterson said of the team’s different looks. “We are a very versatile team and can be dangerous when we exploit our lineups against opposing teams.”</p>\n<p>Johnson paced the Gauchos with 23 points and six rebounds despite a poor shooting night (5-for-18 on field goals). Nunnally scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half, and Hornbuckle added nine points, five rebounds and two blocks. Garth recorded a game-high five assists.</p>\n<p>A scary moment for the Gauchos occurred with 12:10 left in the game when senior forward Jaimé Serna rose up to score on a driving layup and was fouled. Serna fell hard to the floor, landing on, and injuring, his right wrist. Luckily for Santa Barbara, X-rays taken the following day came back negative, and Serna is currently day-to-day.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased with the win,” coach Williams said. “[Fullerton] is a really good team. … Overall, it was a productive night for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face UC Riverside on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43374\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43374\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/","id":822,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[821,820,819],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Grabs Sixth at Home Tourney","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The defending national runner-up UCSB men’s volleyball team opened their 2012 season with a sixth-place finish at the UCSB/asics Invitational Tournament on Saturday.

UNLV threatened to run away with the game, taking a 57-49 lead after a 12-2 run with seven minutes left to play in the second half. Consecutive three-pointers from senior forward James Nunnally and Johnson brought the Gauchos to within two. The Runnin’ Rebels again held off the home team to take its biggest lead of the game at 69-59 with two minutes left to play after another Moser three, forcing a Gaucho timeout.</p>\n<p>“We knew the game was far from over,” Johnson said. “We practice those situations all the time. … We just kept believing in each other.”</p>\n<p>UCSB came out of the timeout determined not to go down without a fight, and Johnson took over. He started the comeback with an assist on a layup by senior center Jaime Serna. Johnson then ran off seven consecutive UCSB points to go along with a rebound and a steal to cut the deficit to one point at 68-69 with 17 seconds left. On the ensuing UNLV possession, Nunnally stole the ball and was called for a charge on the fastbreak in a controversial play.</p>\n<p>“I thought that first [charge call] was questionable,” Williams said. “It was a tough call, but as a competitor you always want to get those close calls.”</p>\n<p>UNLV took a three-point lead after two free throws, and UCSB had the ball under its own basket, down by three with seven seconds left. As expected, the Runnin’ Rebels opted to foul Johnson, sending him to the line down by three with two seconds left. After Johnson hit the first free throw, Williams subbed in seven-footer Greg Somogyi as the UCSB home crowd collectively held its breath.</p>\n<p>“It was amazing fan support,” freshman point guard T.J. Taylor said. “It was a great atmosphere to play in, and a really fun game…It is just disappointing that we came up short.”</p>\n<p>Johnson intentionally missed the second free throw, and in the scramble for the offensive rebound, Somogyi was able to miraculously corral the ball and toss up a shot, completing the Gaucho comeback to send the game to overtime with zeros on the clock.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to shoot it as high as I could, got a lucky bounce, and the big fella caught it and put it in with no time left on the clock,” Johnson said. “That was a big, exciting moment.”</p>\n<p>When the game is on the line, you expect your clutch players to play their best basketball. Johnson and Nunnally stepped up for the Gauchos in the first overtime period. Rejuvenated and excited after Somogyi’s buzzer-beater, the UCSB squad dug in defensively as the senior duo scored 10 points on 3-of-3 shooting and 3-of-3 from the free throw line to put the Gauchos up three with 13 seconds left. Taylor stepped up to hit a huge three-pointer with the game tied to put the gauchos in front at 81-78 with 1:19 left in the overtime period.</p>\n<p>“I have to be confident and step up in those situations,” Taylor said. “Orlando and [Nunnally] can’t do it by themselves.”</p>\n<p>On the next possession, UNLV recorded an offensive rebound off a potential game tying three-pointer before a second offensive rebound and quick kick-out allowed senior guard Chace Stanback an opportunity at the buzzer. Stanback hit the three as part of his 19 points, all of which came after halftime, to send the game to double overtime.</p>\n<p>“It was just desperation man,” the UCLA transfer Stanback said. “Thankfully I was able to hit it.”</p>\n<p>Williams explained his rationale behind not opting to foul UNLV to send them to the free throw line at the end of the first overtime.</p>\n<p>“Ideally, what we would have loved is to have a foul after that rebound with about four seconds left,” Williams said. “But I wasn’t thinking about fouling with [13 seconds] left.”</p>\n<p>In the second overtime period, Serna was called for an intentional foul that gave UNLV a free point with just under five minutes to play. They never trailed again, ending the game 94-88 behind two Stanback free throws. Another questionable offensive foul on Nunnally with just under four minutes left sent the senior to the bench for good with five fouls.</p>\n<p>“It hurt not having [Nunnally] out there,” Johnson said. “He is always a threat to score and they would trap me and I would have to pass.”</p>\n<p>Nunnally recorded 14 points and 8 rebounds, and senior center Serna added 13 points and six boards. Anthony Marshall recorded a game-high eight assists for the Runnin’ Rebels, and Stanback went 9-of-10 from the free throw line for his 19 points.</p>\n<p>The Runnin’ Rebels previously upset No. 1 North Carolina in Las Vegas 90-80. In that game, Stanback led UNLV with 28 points and 10 rebounds, and Moser with 18 rebounds, and Bellfield with 9 assists.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to give UNLV a ton of credit,” Williams said. “They were outstanding defensively. That’s the best defensive team we’ve played by far.”</p>\n<p>This marks the second consecutive game that the Gauchos have lost in overtime to a visiting Mountain West school. On Saturday night, UCSB fell to SDSU 76-75 in overtime. While the past two games are certainly tough to swallow for the veteran Gaucho squad, the team has some perspective going forward.</p>\n<p>“It’s just tough to swallow, those games like that,” Johnson said. “We will just build on this, that’s all we can do…We can’t sit here and sulk, it was tough and it hurts, but tomorrow we are going to have to forget about it, and get back to studying for finals and getting ready for this roadtrip we got ahead of us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will hit the road for a four-game roadtrip against San Diego, Washington, BYU, and Cal that begins in San Diego on Dec 13.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/","id":821,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[820,819,818],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeated by Creighton in Third Round of NCAA’s","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men's soccer team was defeated 2-1 in third round action of the NCAA tournament against Creighton in Omaha, Nebraska on Sunday.

Creighton attempted 17 shots overall, including twelve attempts in the first half that yielded two goals.</p>\n<p>Both of Creighton’s goals were scored on dead-ball plays, the first a penalty against junior forward Sam Garza within the box just seven minutes into the first half. Garza’s foul call was met with frustration from the UCSB sideline and allowed Creighton’s Bruno Castro to put the Blue Jays up 1-0 on the PK.</p>\n<p>“It was about the worst way to start a game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We were very confused as to what the call even was. He had told Sam Garza not to hold [Creighton’s Ethan Finlay] and Sam said he was not holding him, but obviously referee saw differently.”</p>\n<p>A second goal came just ten minutes later when Andrew Ribeiro was able to connect on a corner kick play. Ribeiro’s low strike on the ground after a deflection was made amidst a swarm of blue and white jerseys, and crept past junior goalkeeper Andre Grandt to push the Blue Jay lead to 2-0, a margin that UCSB was unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>“It was really tough coming back from two goals down early on,” Sarle said. “We had a chance in the last ten minutes but it’s always tough going down two like that. Especially against Creighton who has only given up a handful of goals all year.”</p>\n<p>The game was physical throughout the 90-minute stretch. Questionable calls toward the end of regulation were met with furious reactions from the UCSB sideline, including the ejection of assistant coach Greg Curry with just over five minutes remaining in the game. The ejection came after Curry’s reaction toward a yellow-card call against senior midfielder Luis Silva that sent a Creighton player to the ground in front of the UCSB bench. Two yellow cards were issued to Creighton, while three were given to UCSB. The Gauchos also received two red cards, both with under five minutes remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>Grandt had arguably his best performance of the year with a season-high eight saves throughout the match. Opoku led all shooters with three shots. League-leading scorer Luis Silva was held to just two shot attempts, and none on goal.</p>\n<p>Silva finishes his collegiate career ranked fifth in the nation with 17 goals and third in the nation in total points with 44, which also ties him for No. 1 in UCSB history for points in a season.</p>\n<p>With the loss, UCSB’s 2011 campaign comes to an end. Creighton advances to the next round of the NCAA tournament and will host the winner of New Mexico vs. USF.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43273\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43273\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/","id":1651,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1650,1649,1648],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Club Brings Home National Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB Women’s Club Soccer Head Coach Todd Heil can finally lift his ban on a team T-shirt that reads “On the Road to Five,” as the women edged out rival Cal Poly 1-0 in Saturday’s championship ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB Women’s Club Soccer Head Coach Todd Heil can finally lift his ban on a team T-shirt that reads “On the Road to Five,” as the women edged out rival Cal Poly 1-0 in Saturday’s <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled-28.jpg?resize=141%2C264\" alt=\"\" width=\"141\" height=\"264\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">championship match to make their five-peat a reality that can’t be jinxed.

The Gauchos beat Colorado State (2-0) and Missouri (2-1) in pool play, and won their first championship flight against Texas State (5-4) in penalty kicks after a scoreless 15 minute overtime period. After an impressive 9-3-1 season record and a 3-0 win against a local club national team, the men were knocked out by North Carolina 3-0 in the quarter final match.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/","id":1650,"author":{"id":306,"name":"Zak Weinberg"},"related":[1649,1648,1647],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take on Huskies at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s basketball finishes off a three-game home stand Wednesday against Pac-12 opponent Washington.

Johnson leads the team with 14.7 points per game, but Nesbit and junior forward Sweets Underwood also average double figures.</p>\n<p>“Anybody on our team can step up any night,” Locke said. “We have to make sure they take good shots in rhythm and just keep executing.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit has made a huge impact in the last two games, averaging 13.5 points.

The Gauchos will need to be aware of Regina Rogers, their leading scorer at 14.7 points per game and shooting 76 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We have to get after it and play our team defense,” Locke said. “We need to know the personnel, continue to rebound and give them one shot.”</p>\n<p>Unlike in their first two games on the road, UCSB has jumped out to a quick start in their last two games, taking large leads into halftime.</p>\n<p>The key will be maintaining their consistency in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be a team that can play both halves, all 40 minutes,” Adrian said. “We need to know that teams are going to keep battling and not just roll over.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/","id":817,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[816,815,814],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Seniors Lead Gaucho Volleyball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team has won every match since Oct. 29 and has secured a No. 2 ranking in the Big West Conference.

I used to be her setter. I drove her to club practice.</p>\n<p>Lily Lopez: Every day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What is your pre-game routine?</strong></p>\n<p>L: We’re very superstitious.</p>\n<p>S: Um, I have to have my lucky sports bras.</p>\n<p>C: I have to have a peanut butter banana sandwich. I have to listen to either Backstreet Boys or *NSYNC. And I can’t say the other one.</p>\n<p>L: I always listen to the same songs.</p>\n<p>C: What songs do you listen to, ghetto rap?</p>\n<p>L: “Hey Ladies” and “Turn Me On,” those are my two … and I always eat candy.</p>\n<p>C: Oh, and then I do a drawing on the whiteboard of the Gaucho killing the other team’s mascot. This is what I did [at Riverside].</p>\n<p>L: That looks like a cat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s your most memorable achievement here?</strong></p>\n<p>C: This season. Every win has been pretty memorable.</p>\n<p>L: I like when we went to the NCAAs [in 2009]. I’ll never forget that. I feel like our team, though, is the closest this year.</p>\n<p>S: If we go to NCAAs this year, it’ll definitely be the best season. I think we’ve had the most fun this year and felt the most comfortable with everyone.</p>\n<p>L: We’re like a family.</p>\n<p>S: I think my most memorable game was beating Long Beach at home in three [sets] two years ago. And this year, beating them in the Pyramid.</p>\n<p>L: That hadn’t happened since any of us had been here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What are your plans after graduation?</strong></p>\n<p>S: I’m considering playing overseas, but I hope to work for a nonprofit. I’ve been interning for nonprofits for a year or two now and I really love what they’re all about.</p>\n<p>C: I’m thinking about going to Europe as well. They love Americans ‘cause Americans are usually the best on the team.</p>\n<p>L: I have more schooling after. I wanna be either a physical therapist or physician’s assistant. I don’t know where I’m gonna go to school though, but I’ll stay in California.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Who is the funniest on the team?</strong></p>\n<p>C: The most dumb?</p>\n<p>L: Chelsey’s the comedy of the team … [she’s] funny by accident. She’s oblivious to it half the time.</p>\n<p>C: I try and lighten the mood.</p>\n<p>L: Jenna [Wilson] cracks everyone up. She’s secretly funny. When you don’t expect it, she’ll just say something funny.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What will you take away from your overall experience at UCSB?</strong></p>\n<p>L: Never settle for less than what you know is your best … and I just feel if I ever need anything, I can count on the girls from this year to be there.</p>\n<p>C: It has made me a lot tougher as an individual. I’ve never been as close to a group of friends.</p>\n<p>S: I just have a whole new appreciation for not just sports, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot of life skills through playing for Kathy … she prepared us for the real world.</p>\n<p>C: If you can handle Kathy, you can handle anyone.

Just six minutes into the match, a through ball by Madueno was met with a powerful kick by Silva, giving UCSB the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was ripped,” Vom Steeg said about Silva’s goal. “Silva was not only great but was on a different level on the field tonight.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s shot from 12 yards out added to his total of 17 goals on the year. At the end of Big West conference play, Silva ranked No. 6 in the nation in goals scored, and ranks No. 12 overall in goals per game with .80 as of Nov. 13.</p>\n<p>Madueno was able to add his name to the shot list at the 40:14 mark, when he received a pass on the left side of the box from sophomore forward Dom Sarle, who is currently second on the team in total assists with nine.</p>\n<p>“Josue was a real important key to the game tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “They couldn’t stay with his pace and athleticism.”</p>\n<p>Down 2-0 coming out of the halftime break, Providence was able to respond with a goal by freshman defender Brandon Adler 22 minutes into the second period. The goal came on a corner kick set and was Adler’s first of the year.</p>\n<p>“I made a curving run toward the back post and made a header,” Adler said. “One of their players tried to clear it off the line but thankfully it went over.”</p>\n<p>Less than five minutes later, Sarle was able to score on a through ball from Silva, who tallied his team-leading 10th assist of the year.</p>\n<p>“I beat [the defender] around the corner quick,” Sarle said. “He cheated near post and I slipped it by him.”</p>\n<p>Providence was able to draw a foul call within the box during the 83rd minute, allowing Anthony Baumann to deliver a penalty kick to the lower left side of the goal. The strike brought the Gaucho lead down to 3-2, where it would remain for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>“We lost to a good team,” Providence Head Coach Chaka Daley said. “The way we played in the second half … we should have played that way in the first half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB out-shot the Friars 8-1 in the first half and 16-6 throughout the game. Providence goalkeeper Jhojan Obando recorded seven total saves during the match, and UCSB junior goalie Andre Grandt tallied two stops.</p>\n<p>UCSB advances to the third round of the tournament against Creighton next Sunday, Nov. 27.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43159\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43159\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/","id":1649,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1648,1647,1646],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tears Apart Lions for Second-Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team earned its second consecutive win Saturday afternoon in the Thunderdome against visiting Loyola Marymount 66-49.

With 13:36 remaining, junior forward Sweets Underwood converted a three-point play to bring the lead to 10. But this time the Gauchos never again allowed their opponents to come within the single digits.</p>\n<p>“We’re pushing the ball early,” Mitchell said. “We’re setting the tone on the offensive end by making the other team get back and play transition defense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 43.8 percent from the field in the first half, compared to LMU’s 23.3 percent.</p>\n<p>The lead continued to blossom for UCSB, and during the second half the lead reached its largest margin at 23 points.</p>\n<p>“We went into it wanting to learn from last game,” junior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “The last game we had, we got a lead early, but we gave it up in the second half, so [this time] we really wanted to stick with it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded the Lions and killed them in second chance points at 21-9.</p>\n<p>“[Rebounding is] something we work every single day on because of our lack of height,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “We’re tired of hearing about it, so we’re going to do something about it and we’re going to rebound.”</p>\n<p>However, turnovers are often the most impressive statistic on the stat sheet — and where the biggest improvements can be made. UCSB turned the ball over nine times in the entire contest while tallying 13 assists.</p>\n<p>While LMU’s star, junior guard Alex Cowling, tallied 22 points on the game, 14 of them came in the second half with the lead firmly under control. Cowling was the only player in double figures for the Lions.</p>\n<p>“[The strategy] was to let her score as many as she could and let nobody else score,” Mitchell said. “She’s a great scorer, but at the end of the day, if you only have one player in double figures, it’s going to be hard for a team to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit, Underwood and Johnson were all in double figures for the Gauchos. While Underwood tallied her third double-double of the season, Johnson caught fire in the second half and led the Gauchos offensively with 21 points and four assists, hitting 5-8 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“We know how good we can be when we’re sharp, focused and playing as a team,” Johnson said. “We can’t win a ball game when all our players aren’t at their best. We have to come out and win together.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finishes off its three-game home stand Wednesday against Washington.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/","id":816,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[815,814,813],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Adds to Win Streak With Doubleheader","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team has now won its last six matches after defeating Cal State Northridge 3-2 on Friday and UC Riverside 3-0 on Saturday.

In the second set, the score was tied at 14 before Schmidt’s kill started an 11-4 run for another UCSB win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We were not going to be denied,” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “There was too much pride at stake. … At times it was close, but we definitely outplayed them. The reason we were successful was our serving; we had 10 service aces [to their four].”</p>\n<p>Determined to earn their fourth sweep in the past five matches, the Gauchos kept the pressure on in the third set, leading the entire way and winning 25-19. Senior libero Chelsey Lowe finished with 38 digs over the weekend, improving her total to 624 this season, which ranks second all-time in single-season UCSB history. Lowe needs 27 digs to move into first place ahead of Leigh Stephenson, who had 650 in 2007.</p>\n<p>“We knew we wanted to win in three,” Lowe said. “We wanted revenge from last time.”</p>\n<p>At Northridge, the Gauchos fell behind 11-4 in the first set before rallying for a 19-18 lead and eventual 25-21 win. In the next set, they got out to an 8-3 lead and remained ahead the whole way en route to a 25-16 victory.</p>\n<p>The Matadors scored the first five points of the third set and held on to the lead throughout, earning a 25-17 win. The fourth set was more evenly matched at first, with the score tied at 11. Then Northridge went on a 14-5 run to close out the set at 25-16 and tie the match 2-2.</p>\n<p>“The momentum had shifted, but we knew we had to focus on our side at that point,” Lowe said.</p>\n<p>In the decisive fifth set, after being tied 9-9, the Matadors scored the next three points, forcing UCSB to call a timeout. Two ensuing errors by Northridge and a kill by Schmidt tied it again at 12. After trading points, Santa Barbara took the lead thanks to another attack error, and sophomore outside hitter Leah Sully had one of her 15 kills to give the Gauchos the win. The victory provides UCSB with its third straight season with double-digit conference wins.</p>\n<p>“I said [during the timeout], we have to make a stop,” Gregory said. “We have to make something happen and go for the aggressive serve. Fortunately, we got a couple of unforced errors [and] made two really good kills … sometimes when you think you’re going to lose, you win.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West season complete, UCSB will finish the regular season at the Aztec Turkey Time Tournament in San Diego next weekend with matches against San Diego State and Texas Christian University.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43146\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-adds-win-streak-doubleheader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43146\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-adds-win-streak-doubleheader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-adds-win-streak-doubleheader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-adds-win-streak-doubleheader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-adds-win-streak-doubleheader/","id":5444,"author":{"id":192,"name":"David Russo"},"related":[5443,5442,5441],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":180,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
