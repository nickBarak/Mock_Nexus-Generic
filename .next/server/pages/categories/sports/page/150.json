They are just one game behind with a 30-18 overall record and an impressive 14-4 mark in Big West action. The Gauchos, however, have won their last three weekend series with Big West opponents and now sit in fifth place at 25-20 and 10-8 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Northridge heads into the game riding high off of its last win as the team defeated No. 8 UCLA 4-1 on the road on Tuesday, a team the Gauchos had previously fallen to 12-3 way back in February.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Not only have the Matadors defeated one of the top-ranked teams, but they have now won eight games in a row as they head into the weekend series.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a lot going for them as well. Since grabbing a win in the series finale at Fullerton, the Gauchos have gone 8-4, capturing three straight weekend series against conference opponents and now have had two straight Big West players of the week and three in the last four.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Joey Epperson takes the award from sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell this week as he was nearly unstoppable at the plate. Epperson went 8-14, extending his hitting streak to 12 games, with six runs scored, four RBI, a stolen base and a home run. The home run came in the bottom of the ninth with a runner on down by one in Sunday’s series finale with Irvine. Epperson took the first pitch deep against the Anteaters closer. On Friday’s game, Epperson had a four-hit day and was just a home run shy of the cycle.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense has really found its stride as of late. With the pitching staff struggling to stay healthy, the offense has been more than willing to put up as many runs as needed. Three Gauchos have had hitting streaks of nine or more games, with Epperson and Newell at 12 and 11 respectively. Sophomore shortstop Woody Woodward, who sits at nine games, could have been player of the week as he went 5-12 this weekend with five RBI.</p>\n<p>Northridge, however, is second in the league this year as a team in runs scored and RBI. Junior first baseman Josh Goossen-Brown leads the Big West conference with 43 RBI so far this year, as he has established himself as a major threat in the heart of the Matador order.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Miles Williams is also a player to keep an eye on. UCSB will look to keep runners off the bases while he is at the plate, as he has hit seven home runs this year in just 86 at bats.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Matadors set to show down at 3 p.m. on Friday at Matador field. Games two and three will both be at 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1287815177\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51272\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/baseball_magaligauthier-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=3456%2C5184&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3456,5184\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1361900171\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"240\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51273\" alt=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 9, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This season, he has groomed his pitchers into one of the top pitching teams in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>Of the solid group that Checketts has at his disposal, the team’s ace, sophomore Austin Pettibone has truly been impressive. Just two years in to his college career, Pettibone has made a major stamp as one of the top pitchers in the Big West. In his first year he compiled a 4.44 ERA over 79 innings pitched. He made 17 appearances, 13 starts, led the staff with his eight wins and even earned a save.</p>\n<p>“The thing that really stands out about [Austin] is his will to prepare,” Checketts said. “He is committed to preparing and committed to his work ethic and doing things right and so he competes every day. He shows up and competes in the weight room and competes in practice and that translates to him going out every Friday.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This year he has upped his game as he leads the Gauchos with 12 games started, six wins, 85 innings pitched and leads all UCSB starters with a 3.39 ERA. Among the conference, Pettibone has thrown the most innings and sits at seventh with his six wins.</p>\n<p>“His stuff has gotten better,” Checketts said. “He has added about 3-4 miles an hour to his fastball, his change-up has been better, his curveball has improved from where it was and still probably has one more jump to make. He shows it in the bullpen and it hasn’t quite translated to the game yet consistently, but he is really committed.”</p>\n<p>On March 15, Pettibone had himself a career performance, pitching a complete game shutout against Sacramento State. He allowed just four hits and did not walk a batter over the course of the game as well as compiling a season-high six strikeouts to lead the Gauchos to a 5-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“My complete game shutout this year was [a] pretty cool experience,” Pettibone said. “I threw like 79 pitches. Everything was working and everything was going my way, so it was just a really great feeling as a pitcher.”</p>\n<p>Despite his exceptional play so far this season, Austin Pettibone may not even be having the most exciting year of the Pettibone family. On April 22, his older brother Jonathan Pettibone made his first career major league start with the Philadelphia Phillies against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jonathan threw five and a third innings as he struck out six while allowing six hits and just two runs in his debut.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty awesome; I got to go out there when he had his debut out in Philly,” Pettibone said. “It was just a great experience to see him out there and he actually threw pretty well so it was just a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan has continued to pitch well as he has thrown two more games and has earned a win in both — one against the New York Mets and another versus the Miami Marlins. He is also set to pitch tonight against the San Francisco Giants.</p>\n<p>In his three starts in the Major Leagues, Jonathan has earned a 2-0 record and a 3.24 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 16.2 innings. He also has given up just two walks in the three games, something that is a major problem for most young starters as the grand stage has been known to rattle up-and-comers.</p>\n<p>“All the scouts and announcers and whoever always mention his composure on the mound whether things are going his way or if they’re not,” Pettibone said. “He even helped with staying calm in those types of situations. Keeping my composure.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan is perhaps showing himself as a potential big leaguer to stay. With the recent injury to former Cy Young award winner Roy Halladay, Pettibone may just get a chance to lock down a spot in the Phillies‘ rotation.</p>\n<p>Jonathan was drafted in the third round in 2008 by the Phillies and signed out of high school.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool growing up with him in the minor leagues,” Pettibone said. “Watching him grind it out and get better from year to year and get better and get stronger and then finally it paid off and he has got his debut this year. It’s just been cool growing up with that the last five years.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan and Austin’s father Jay had made it to the big leagues in 1983, so with a past of pitching the two young men seemed to have their sights set.</p>\n<p>“Since I was five years old I was throwing the baseball around and playing tee ball,” Pettibone said. “We were all pitchers and I have a cousin that’s a pitcher in high school right now. It’s just been a Pettibone thing to be a pitcher.”</p>\n<p>The two brothers still have a long way to go before the season ends, but they’re certainly set to continue their great years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/","id":4684,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4683,4682,4681],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Young Warriors Versus the Veteran Spurs: Stephan Curry Takes Golden State to Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Stephan-Curry.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Stephan-Curry.jpg?resize=445%2C583&ssl=1","description":"  The NBA playoffs are really about one thing: who is playing the best basketball right now.The Golden State Warriors are that hot team.

However, Game One was in Golden State’s control. Late mistakes and a failure to close out the contest allowed the veteran San Antonio squad to take the early series advantage, but the underdog Warriors absolutely proved it should be a very close series.</p>\n<p>The Warriors may have five players averaging more than 12 points in the playoffs, but there is only one name that really matters for the Warriors and that is Stephen Curry. The young player has become one of the great point guards in the league and didn’t disappoint in Game One against the Spurs, totaling 44 points on 18-35 shooting, including six three-pointers and 11 assists in nearly 58 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Easily the MVP of the playoffs so far, Curry can do it all offensively. Get up in his face and he’ll drive by you and make an easy layup, or even a difficult circus shot in the lane if there’s help. Sag off of him to stop the drive and he’ll drain the three-point shot. This season, with his quick release, Curry overtook Ray Allen for most three-pointers in a season in NBA history.</p>\n<p>Not to mention he’s a point guard, so he has no problem sharing the ball and racking up his assist numbers. He averages 9.6 assists in the playoffs, the best in the NBA. In fact, in the Denver series, Curry became the only player in NBA history with at least seven assists and four three-pointers in four straight playoff games. And he did it in the first four playoff games of his career.</p>\n<p>Curry also ranks third in player efficiency rating, behind only Kevin Durant and LeBron James. Those are big names to be grouped with for a man that was left off the All-Star team this season. Curry has something to prove, and overcoming the Spurs and winning a second-round playoff series for the first time since the 1974-75 season would be the perfect way to do it.</p>\n<p>This season, the Warriors and Spurs split their series 2-2, with each team winning on its own home court. Yet while the Spurs finished in second in the Western Conference, the Warriors finished sixth, and still have a lot of room for improvement, especially in the turnover department. If this young, athletic Golden State team can draw out the series, the more of an advantage it has as it may be able to tire out a veteran team.</p>\n<p>Plus, Golden State has possibly the best home court advantage, with a crowd and city that has gone crazy for its team given its lack of success in the last few decades. If the Warriors can steal one on the road, which they proved in Game One that they have the potential to, the home court advantage could push the series in their favor.</p>\n<p>Finally, both teams have proven they love to play the up-tempo style, wanting to put lots of points on the board. Golden State leads the league in points per game during the playoffs at 110.0, although San Antonio is close behind at 109.0. In the end, this style should benefit the Warriors because if you’re going to run, young, athletic teams will usually win the race.</p>\n<p>Either way, if Monday’s game is any indication, it’s going to be a very entertaining series.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Warriors in seven</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Xu of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The Angels and Blue Jays spent a lot of money in the offseason and are struggling mightily. The Angels are 11-20, and we have learned that the days of small ball and a great bullpen are long forgotten. They have stolen only 12 bases so far and have a 9:1 strikeout to home run ratio. Josh Hamilton is hitting .208 with two home runs. Then there are their pitching woes. The Angels are second to last in the league in team ERA (4.78) and sixth to last in batting average against (.265). The takeaway: Manager Mike Scioscia is in the hot seat.</p>\n<p>Before the season, many experts had the Blue Jays winning the AL East because they acquired R.A. Dickey, Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Melky Cabrera. Now, Toronto is 11-21 with Reyes and Johnson hurt and Cabrera, Buehrle and Dickey all struggling. The takeaway: Don’t sign players who were suspended for steroids a season ago or trade for 38-year-old knuckleballers and injury-plagued starting pitchers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Wide Strikeouts</p>\n<p>The league-wide strikeout rates are entering unprecedented territory. This past April featured the second-highest strikeout per game total for a single month in MLB history at 15.29 hitters per game. It wasn’t just April either, the top eight highest strikeout per game totals for a month have come in the last eight months of play. That’s right — the last eight months of play are the top eight months for strikeout per game totals in MLB history. The month that holds the top spot is September 2012, when an average of 15.47 hitters struck out per game.</p>\n<p>Many hitters will point to April’s cold, bad-for-hitting weather in many cities or the pitchers arm’s being fresher, but when this trend dates back to last season it is pretty safe to say that this is an on-going trend. So what is causing this? Twins catcher Joe Mauer has said recently that pitchers are developing deeper pitch repertoires since he came into the league ten years ago. It could also be that since the ousting of performance-enhancing drugs, hitters now have to try a lot harder to hit home runs leading to more whiffs and thus more strikeouts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yu Darvish Can Pitch</p>\n<p>This isn’t shocking news ­— ­­­­­­­­­­­we all already knew Darvish could pitch. However, what we didn’t know heading into the season is that Darvish has a chance to make history. After barely missing a no-hitter on April 2 against the Astros, Darvish is 5-1 with a 2.56 ERA, and opponents are hitting an abysmal .169 off of him. Here is the historic part: In his 45.2 innings pitched so far this season, he has accumulated 72 strikeouts. That’s about 14 strikeouts for every nine innings pitched, which means he is on pace to become the first pitcher since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2002 to strikeout 300 batters in a season. If he keeps this up, Darvish could make history by becoming the first Japanese born pitcher to win the Cy Young.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2013 is a new year for 2012 Cy Young Winners David Price and R.A. Dickey</p>\n<p>20-5, 2.56 ERA, 205 K’s — 20-6, 2.73 ERA, 230 K’s</p>\n<p>The numbers above reflect the final regular season stats of last season’s Cy Young award winners, David Price and R.A. Dickey respectively. Now, unfortunately, both of these quality pitchers are finding out that 2012 is no more. So far this season Price is 1-3 with a 6.25 ERA and 40 K’s in 44.2 innings. Dickey is 2-5 with a 5.36 ERA and only 33 K’s in 42 innings.</p>\n<p>These struggles will almost certainly end for Price because he has proven he can be consistently dominant in the competitive AL East. Furthermore, a guy who throws upper 90s with a plus slider and good command will not continue to get lit up like he has. As for Dickey, these struggles shouldn’t be that surprising. He is 38 years old and has won more than 10 games in a season only once before last year. Perhaps the injuries are causing the knuckleball not to knuckle, but his poor numbers could also be a result of moving out of the poor NL East and into the AL East. Now Dickey has to face the big hitting Red Sox, Yankees and Orioles multiple times a year instead of teams like the Marlins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The MLB is becoming a young man’s league</p>\n<p>We are seeing a dramatic drop-off in the number of players who are still productive into their late 30s. Gone are the days where guys like Barry Bonds were hitting 40 home runs annually in late 30s. Now the game is being dominated by young and freakishly athletic players like Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg and Clayton Kershaw.</p>\n<p>What has caused this trend? We don’t know. It could be the passing of the steroid era, which made players better for longer, or simply the manifestation of human evolution right before our eyes. What we do know is that players like Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton, Alex Rodriguez, Roy Halladay and many other aging stars are not doing well at all. Instead, the players who are making headlines are barely out of their teenage years. In honor of this trend, here are the top 10 players who are 25 years old or younger and who are not named Trout, Harper, Kershaw or Strasburg.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Manny Machado, age: 20, 5 HRs, 21 RBIs, .309 BA. First in league among third basemen with .8 defensive wins above replacement, which measures production compared to the average player. Machado is being compared to Orioles Hall of Fame third basemen Brooks Robinson, who won a record sixteen consecutive gold gloves.</p>\n<p>Anthony Rizzo, age: 23, 8 HRs, 21 RBIs, .246 BA. Despite the low batting average, Rizzo still maintains a solid .331 on-base percentage, which speaks to his eye at the plate.</p>\n<p>Jose Fernandez, age: 20, 1-2, 3.48 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 32 K’s. Fernandez is the fourth pitcher in the last 90 seasons under the age of 21 to throw seven or more scoreless innings with at least nine strikeouts and allow one hit or fewer.</p>\n<p>Elvis Andrus, age: 24, .246 BA, 10 RBIs, 6 stolen bases. Andrus’s superb defense and 129 career stolen bases are among the many reasons why the Rangers locked him up with an eight year, $120 million contract extension.</p>\n<p>Matt Moore, age: 23, 5-1, 1.95 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 41 Ks. Moore has allowed only 20 hits in 37 innings pitched so far this season, which means … hope for a walk.</p>\n<p>Jose Altuve, age: 23, .331 BA, 15 RBIs, 1 HR. The only thing more impressive than Altuve’s batting average is that he is doing it at 5’5”, 173 pounds. The epitome of a baseball player.</p>\n<p>Jean Segura, age: 23, .333 BA, 4 HRs, 13 RBIs, 8 stolen bases. After coming over from the Angels in the Greinke trade last season, all Segura has done is hit, hit and hit some more.</p>\n<p>Will Middlebrooks, age: 24, .195 BA, 6 HRs, 12 RBIs. Don’t let his early season slump fool you; Middlebrooks was keeping up with Mike Trout last year before falling to injury. Middlebrooks will be a 30 home run guy for a long time in Boston.</p>\n<p>Chris Sale, age: 24, 3-2, 3.42 ERA, 1.10 WHIP, 42 K’s. Sale has a power arm from the left side and a good feel for all of his pitches. He was in the running for AL Cy Young last year after posting a 17-8 record.</p>\n<p>Matt Harvey, age: 24, 4-0, 1.56 ERA, .82 WHIP, 46 K’s. Harvey’s hard fastball, along with the fact that opponents are hitting .153 against him, has people comparing him to Mets Hall of Famer Tom Seaver.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1812361325\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51214\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51215\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-07/youth-are-taking-over-the-mlb-this-season/machado/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?fit=900%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Machado\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51215\" alt=\"Machado\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 7, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The win was the Gauchos’ first against a top-25 ranked team this year.</p>\n<p>The second game of the weekend was a completely different story as both teams’ offenses couldn’t be stopped. UCSB got off to a terrific start with senior shortstop Keilani Jennings hitting a two-run home run in the top of the first inning.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Jessica Tetzlaff followed with a single to bring junior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil home and increase the Gauchos’ lead to 3-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not have control for long though, as Hawaii took a 4-3 lead with home runs by junior catcher Sharla Kliebenstein and senior centerfielder Kelly Majam in the second inning.</p>\n<p>An RBI from Pilpil and a throwing error by Hawaii in the third gave UCSB the lead again at 6-4, but two more home runs by the Rainbow Wahine put them back on top 7-6 and ended Wisdom’s day at pitcher.</p>\n<p>With Hawaii leading 10-6 in the sixth, Jennings made program history for Santa Barbara. With her second home run of the day, Jennings not only brought her team within one run, but she also picked up her 31st career home run, the most ever by a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Hawaii kept the momentum as senior shortstop Jessica Iwata put the icing on the cake in the sixth inning with her team’s fifth home run of the day, sealing an 11-9 victory.</p>\n<p>Jennings’ five RBIs tied her career-high for most in a single game.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, Hawaii played more like the dominant team that they have been all year.

Every single out he has had has been hit hard,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “That’s the right guy to have at the plate. He does everything right and he is prepared. He absolutely deserved [the walk off] because the way that he has handled himself in the dugout and practice.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, UCSB moves up to 25-20 on the year and 10-8 in the Big West Conference, just one game behind Irvine and Cal Poly for third place. The Anteaters, meanwhile, drop to 29-15 and 11-7 in conference.</p>\n<p>In Fridays game one of the series, the Gauchos pitching staff allowed the most runs they have in a single game all season. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone, who had been lights out as the staff’s ace, was crushed by the Anteaters. He gave up a season high nine runs through just five and a third innings for his shortest outing of the year.</p>\n<p>Both teams were able to put up two runs in the first inning, but the Gauchos scored one in the third and three in the fourth to take a 6-2 lead. UCSB chased junior starting pitcher Andrew Thurman after just four innings of work as he allowed six runs on 10 hits.</p>\n<p>“[Friday] was a weird day because their guy was throwing and he is projected to be a second or third round draft pick and our guy was going and he is a sophomore and not draft eligible but pretty good,” Checketts said. “Both these guys have been leaders in the conference for ERA, so going into it you think it’s going to be a 2-1 ballgame, but they both got roughed up.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did not hold the lead long however, as Irvine returned with a run in the fifth and exploded for seven in the sixth to jump on Pettibone. Three consecutive doubles topped off the inning that was then followed by a four-run seventh.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would go on to score a run in each of the final three innings but would ultimately fall 14-9 in game one.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB bounced back to tie the series with a 5-3 win thanks to a quality spot start by freshman pitcher Robby Nesovic.</p>\n<p>“Against Riverside Justin Jacome rolled his ankle so he is out two to three weeks. He did it covering first and ended up pitching two more innings on it but now the doc has shut him down,” Checketts said. “The freshmen did a good job of picking up the freshman. Nesovic threw enough strikes and was able to battle out of some jams.”</p>\n<p>Not only was Nesovic impressive on the mound, throwing six innings and allowing just three runs, but he also went 3-3 at the plate and helped his own cause with a solo home run in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters were able to tag him for three runs on a home run by senior right fielder Scott Gottschling to tie the game in the top of the sixth, but sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward came back to break the tie in the bottom of the sixth to take the lead and set up freshman pitcher Dylan Hecht’s seventh save which included him striking out the side.</p>\n<p>In the rubber game of the weekend series, the Gauchos sent sophomore Andrew Vasquez to the hill after a successful return last weekend after he had been out for a month. He pitched five and a third innings and allowed three runs on five hits while striking out six.</p>\n<p>“The key point of this game is that we got Andrew Vasquez back and he looked the part,” Checketts said. “He wasn’t perfect, but he sure looked like his old self and maybe a little bit better than his old self. He threw enough strikes and was really good.”</p>\n<p>Epperson led off the bottom of the first with a single and scored the game’s first run on a Woodward single. In the third, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and Woodward each drove in a run to put the Gauchos ahead 3-0.</p>\n<p>Irvine fought back in the fourth on a two-run home run by Gottschling, his second in two days. The Anteaters would then tie the game in the sixth and take the lead in the seventh, a lead they would hold until the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>\n<p>After taking on an insurance run in the top of the ninth UCI led 6-4 with just three outs to go. Red hot sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell singled to lead off the inning and extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Newell stole second and came around to score on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos down by just the one run allowed in the top of the inning, Epperson stepped to the plate with the tying run on first base. Epperson crushed the first pitch he saw to left center field for the walk off two-run home run.</p>\n<p>“Obviously I was just in the right place at the right time and I got rewarded for it,” Epperson said. “My at bat is just a testament to the guys before me putting quality at bats together and that’s what we’re all about. We pass the baton and pick each other up.”</p>\n<p>Coming up next for the Gauchos will be a three-game road series with Cal State Northridge this Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The Matadors currently sit in second place in the Big West, four games ahead of UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of  May 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51195\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51195\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/","id":4683,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4682,4681,4680],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jason Collins Breaks Another Barrier","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jason-Collins-sports.inquirer.net_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jason-Collins-sports.inquirer.net_.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Monday was the historic day we have all been waiting for.

Although both players announced the same thing, this case is different and carries more significance because Collins is a man.</p>\n<p>Superstars from Kobe Bryant to Kevin Durant, as well as current and former teammates of Collins, have expressed their support for him. Because of the politically correct environment we live in and fear of getting labeled as homophobic by the media, it is unlikely we will hear other athletes, except Mike Wallace of the NFL, speak out against Collins’ sexual preference. Still, he in all likelihood will suffer from intolerant verbal abuse from players and fans if he does play in the NBA again.</p>\n<p>The announcement marks the first step for Collins. However, the next phase is to actually step onto the court and play. Collins is already at the declining stage of his career and is nothing more than a solid role player off the bench at best. He’s coming off a year where he played a total of 38 games and scored 41 total points, averaging eight minutes per game.</p>\n<p>The next NBA team to sign Collins will likely sign him because of his leadership abilities on and off the court. Yet, if no team ends up signing him, it will diminish the importance of him coming out, as there still would not be an openly gay player to play professionally. The magnitude of Collins coming out hinders on if he actually ends up on the roster of an NBA team by next season.</p>\n<p>Only then will we be able to see the progress American sports has made in regards to accepting gay athletes into their profession; otherwise, Collins will be just another athlete who came out after his playing days were over. A Stanford graduate and well-spoken individual, Collins serves as the perfect ambassador for gay male athletes in a culture that has repeatedly rejected antimasculine behavior.</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of speculation of players in the NFL coming out and it will be interesting to see how football players and the league reacts when this happens, especially since the NFL has had trouble dealing with the sensitivity of the issue. Nonetheless, the NBA has handled this case perfectly with Commissioner David Stern issuing his support.</p>\n<p>Collins no doubt made this decision for his own well-being, as he admitted he didn’t intend to be the first male athlete to come out, but his choice to come out marks an important milestone for sports in the country. More importantly, his announcement serves as an inspiration for active and future gay athletes to play their careers being who they are.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of sports.inquirer.net</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/","id":3192,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3191,3190,3189],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sports Sensations: The Best of the Best","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tebow-npr.org_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tebow-npr.org_.jpg?resize=948%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Professional sport is first and foremost entertainment, and marketing is the backbone of any successful entertainment industry.

We’ve all seen it, heard it and read it. John Lennon famously once said that The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, and at the time, not many were inclined to debate that with him. Since the emergence of ESPN and the boom of sports media, we’ve seen countless ascents into stardom that would make Michael Jackson blush and Babe Ruth spit out his beer in shock. So here they are: the top five sports sensations in recent memory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>5. “Tebow-mania,” Tim Tebow, Quarterback, Florida Gators and Denver Broncos</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As far as pure popularity goes, Timmy Tebow should probably be higher on this list. The guy branded public prayer for God’s sake (pun intended). He might have been the most successful quarterback in college football history, and after being written off as a future tight end by draft analysts, he still got drafted in the first round. The legend only grew when he was given credit for willing his Broncos to a playoff victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers, despite being the worst quarterback in the league. However, a quarterback needs to be able to throw the ball, and Tebow still hasn’t figured it out, leading to his release by the New York Jets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>4. “Lin-sanity,” Jeremy Lin, Point Guard, New York Knicks and Houston Rockets </b></p>\n<p>Lin-sanity is yet another example of the power of the New York media. The kid from Harvard came out of nowhere (fourth string on the Knicks depth chart to be precise) to take the league by storm. Before getting hurt, Lin strung together a streak of 20-point games that made him the most popular Asian-American basketball player since Yao Ming. Unfortunately, the madness that captured the nation was short-lived. Lin’s injury and departure to Houston cut the buzz short right at its peak. Even though Lin had a great season, the smaller market and role as second fiddle to James Harden has cooled the number of #linsanity’s that emerged last year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>3. “MT Hammer,” Mike Trout, Outfielder, Los Angeles Angels</b></p>\n<p>Alright, so MT Hammer is kinda catchy, but it doesn’t have the universal recognition of the other names on this list. However, Mike Trout had the best rookie season in professional sports history. The 20-year-old kid would have and probably should have won the AL MVP award after leading baseball in multiple statistical categories, including Wins Above Replacement. And when the actual winner also won the Triple Crown, that’s a hell of a distinction. Trout does everything you can ask for from a baseball player: showing gold glove defense, elite speed and possibly the best bat in the game. If not for the Angels missing the playoffs, Trout would have been the biggest thing to hit baseball since the ballpark hot dog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>2. “The Next Pele,” Neymar da Silva Santos Junior, Forward, Santos (Brazil)</b></p>\n<p>Neymar is the name on this list who might be the most unknown to the average American sports fan. But make no mistake, Neymar is the most popular athlete in the world. Neymar is on the cover of video games, the star of comic books and the seventh richest soccer player in the world after receiving massive endorsement deals at the age of 17. The 21-year-old sensation from Brazil won his first of back-to-back South American Footballer of the Year awards in 2011 at the age of 19 and has already drawn comparisons to Pele and Lionel Messi. In fact, Pele himself said that Neymar is already better than Messi, sparking the debate to who is in fact the best player in the world. Prepare to hear more about the young phenom, as it was announced last week that Neymar is ready to end his loyal relationship with his original club and make his long-anticipated move to Europe, with Barcelona in the lead for his services.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>1. “Fernando-mania,” Fernando Valenzuela, Pitcher, Los Angeles Dodgers</b></p>\n<p>I know this article promised the top rises to stardom in recent memory, but Fernando was the original phenom and deserves the spot atop this list. In 1981, at the age of 20, Valenzuela won his first eight starts for the Dodgers, and the biggest baseball craze of the last 50 years had begun. Fernando’s youthful energy and enthusiasm, historic popularity, especially among the Latino community in Southern California, and all-time great screwball captured the attention of the nation. The timing was perfect as well, with ESPN only a couple years old and in prime position to fuel the fire. 1981 might have been Fernando’s best season, with the Dodgers winning the World Series and the pitcher winning Rookie of the Year and the NL Cy Young award. But the mania lasted throughout the 80s, with Fernando winning 21 games in 1986 and pitching a no-hitter in 1990. Without injuries derailing his career in the early 90s, Fernando might have gone down as one of the greatest pitchers of all-time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of npr.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51140\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/sports-sensations-the-best-of-the-best/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51140\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/sports-sensations-the-best-of-the-best/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/sports-sensations-the-best-of-the-best/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/sports-sensations-the-best-of-the-best/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/sports-sensations-the-best-of-the-best/","id":3196,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3195,3194,3193],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Germany Takes Over Soccer","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bayern-en.wikipedia.org_.png?resize=220%2C220&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bayern-en.wikipedia.org_.png?resize=220%2C220&ssl=1","description":"When this season’s FIFA World XI was announced, many fans and pundits alike were upset that every player on the team was from La Liga, the Spanish premier league.

However, the sheer ease with which Bayern dispatched Barcelona illustrates the gulf in class between the two teams.</p>\n<p>Madrid was able to make the second leg against Dortmund interesting with two late goals at the Santiago Bernabeau, but the final result was never really in question as Los Blancos were unable to close the gap that striker Robert Lewandowski created with his four first leg goals.</p>\n<p>A common debate between soccer fans over the past few years has over which league is better, La Liga or the English Premier League? La Liga supporters argued that Spain had the best league because it has the two best teams: Real Madrid and Barcelona. EPL supporters argued that England was the best because it had better teams top to bottom than any other league.</p>\n<p>I think that argument can be put to rest, for now at least.</p>\n<p>With Bayern and Dortmund meeting each other in an all-German Champions League final, it is clear that the German giants are the best teams in the world. Gone are the days where German soccer was criticized for being too mechanical and boring.</p>\n<p>Sure, one of the main reasons Bayern dominated Barcelona was due its massive size and speed advantage across the board. Most of Barcelona’s players are less than six feet tall and are not the prototypical athletes. However, for years Barcelona has wiped the floor with bigger, stronger and faster teams. To beat them, Bayern created a game plan and implemented it to perfection: absorb the pressure, don’t let the ball go inside the box, and hit Barcelona fast and hard on the counter. With a staunch defense and two of the best wide players in the world in Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, Bayern was able expose Barcelona where it is the weakest.</p>\n<p>The humiliating 7-0 loss on aggregate may ultimately be the turning point for Barcelona, signifying the end of what was perhaps the greatest team run in sports history. The Blaugrana won La Liga three straight seasons from 2008-11 and won the Champions League in both 2009 and 2011, leading many pundits to label them as the best team of all time.</p>\n<p>However, with two of their most instrumental players Xavi Hernandez and Carles Puyol reaching the end of their careers and a defense that disappoints on a regular basis, it may be time for Barcelona to consider rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Some may say that I am overreacting, that all Barcelona needs is a couple players here and there and they will again be considered the best team in the world. That would perhaps be enough if all Barcelona was concerned about was winning La Liga. However, Barça and their fans are not content with domestic success; they need to have success in Europe as well. And with Bayern only getting better this summer with the acquisition of young German playmaker Mario Gotze from, ironically, Borussia Dortmund, and Madrid lining up bids for Tottenham’s Gareth Bale and Napoli’s Edinson Cavani, Barcelona will have an even steeper hill to climb to get back to the Champions League Final.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, on May 25 in Wembley Stadium, the world will get to see the new brand of German soccer that is being played: fast paced, exciting, but most of all, dominant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of en.wikipedia.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/","id":3195,"author":{"id":291,"name":"Austin Richardson"},"related":[3194,3193,3192],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take  Fourth at Conference Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Golf","publish_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golf2_CourtesyOfTonyMastres.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golf2_CourtesyOfTonyMastres.jpg?resize=500%2C377&ssl=1","description":"Led by sophomore Brett Silvernail’s first-place score, the UCSB golf team closed out the Big West Conference Championship yesterday with a fourth-place finish.

Scher finished the tournament in a three-way tie for eighth place by shooting 5-over par 221, making it the seventh-straight time he has finished in the top 10.</p>\n<p>With a score of 305 in the first day of the competition, the Gauchos at that point were tied with UC Irvine for ninth overall and 13 shots off first place, a deficit that would prove to be too much to overcome by the third day of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“Our hopes of winning the tournament kind of got really squashed because of our terrible opening round,” Ley said.</p>\n<p>Senior Jordan Epstein finished 5-over par and fellow senior Marshall Colby was one shot behind Epstein to conclude the first round. Epstein and Colby ended the tournament in 17th and 41st place, respectively.</p>\n<p>Another notable performance by the Gauchos was delivered by sophomore Amol Mahal who placed 36th overall by shooting 17-over par 233.</p>\n<p>The tournament marks the final competition for the Gauchos this season as they look to build on what they accomplished this year going forward. With only two seniors on the current roster, the team will rely on its core group of returning players for next season.</p>\n<p>“Building on what we did in those last two rounds I think is really going to be one of our goals going into next year,” Ley said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of Tony Mastres</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51147\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51147\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/","id":1807,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1806,1805,1804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"It’s All Business in Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team faces one of its toughest challenges of the year this weekend when it travels to No. 22 Hawaii for its final away games of the season.

However, the Gauchos play them at what may be their most vulnerable time of the season, as they are coming off consecutive blowout losses to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii’s sitting at the top and we’re gunning for them,” Boser said. “They have everything to lose and we plan on taking it from them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos haven’t been playing their best ball either though, finding themselves in an up-and-down stretch over the last month and a half that has seen them go 9-13 in their last 22 games.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara’s offense has struggled to put up runs in the past few months, the team has still been able to consistently rely on the leadership and two-way play of sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Wisdom’s 39 RBIs are good for second in the Big West, and she has compiled 119 strikeouts, fifth most in the conference, despite sharing a lot of time in the circle with junior Andriana Collins and freshman Alex Pingree.</p>\n<p>“Shelby has improved tremendously; she’s taken more of a leadership role and that’s been very helpful for everybody,” sophomore infielder Jenessa Jeppesen said. “She’s been a really good role model for everyone on the team just by setting an example by pushing herself and being the best she can be.”</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that it doesn’t exactly have one standout player on offense, Hawaii utilizes an overall balanced attack. To put the team’s numbers in perspective, Hawaii has five players with 30 or more RBIs this season, compared to just one for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine’s offense has put up an average of 5.4 runs per game in 2013, but what truly carries them is the remarkable play of their pitcher, senior Kaia Parnaby.</p>\n<p>With just six games left before NCAA Regionals, Parnaby has already struck out an incredible 301 batters this season. In second place behind her in the Big West is LBSU’s junior pitcher Erin Jones-Wesley with just 172 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Parnaby’s 1.30 ERA is by far the lowest in the conference, and her 34-4 starting record is one of the best in the entire nation.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Hawaii kick off the weekend on Friday at 9 p.m. and finish their season series on Saturday with games at 5 and 7 p.m. All games will be at Rainbow Wahine Softball Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51142\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51142\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/","id":1021,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1020,1019,1018],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Climb the Big West Standings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier.jpg?resize=480%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  This weekend, the UCSB baseball team will welcome third-place UC Irvine onto its home field for a chance to move into the top of the Big West Conference standings.

So we just need to stay focused and stay healthy.”</p>\n<p>Irvine holds the third-best batting average in the Big West at .286 as a team thanks in large part to sophomore first baseman Connor Spencer and sophomore third baseman Taylor Sparks. Spencer hits 387, which leads the Big West, while Sparks maintains a .345 average.</p>\n<p>However talented the opposing offense may be, the Gaucho pitching staff has showed it is as good as any to shut down the opposition. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone leads the Big West in innings pitched with 79.2, and his 6-2 record and 2.60 ERA are tops among Santa Barbara starters.</p>\n<p>Following up Pettibone has been freshman pitcher Justin Jacome, who has been quite impressive in his own right this season. Jacome has thrown 65 innings en route to a 4-3 record on the season but has struck out 45 in that span. In his last outing against Riverside, Jacome struck out six and allowed just two hits over seven and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s pitching staff has impressed as well this year, however, and will be a tough group for the UCSB offense to conquer. The Anteaters’ pitchers have a team ERA of just 3.18 this year and are second in the Big West at striking out opposing hitters.</p>\n<p>Behind both pitching staffs are some stellar defensive teams. The Anteaters lead the Big West with a .983 fielding percentage while the Gauchos hold perhaps one of the best shortstops in the league in junior Brandon Trinkwon.</p>\n<p>“We obviously need to come out and swing the bats. We have got some guys on the bump that are pretty special so we just need to see strikes and hit strikes,” Trinkwon said. “As far as defense, we just need to play behind our pitchers. We’re pretty good and have home field advantage, so that should help us a little bit. Besides that, we just need to play our game.”</p>\n<p>Over the last couple weeks, the Gauchos offense has really picked up the pace. They have outscored opponents 31-19 over the past four games. Leading the charge has been sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell, who earned Big West Player of the Week honors with his performance over his last four games.</p>\n<p>Newell went 9-14 with four RBI last week, including two three-hit performances. Newell has seen himself drop in the lineup from leadoff into more opportunistic RBI spots as his bat has continued to heat up. Since losing his 12-game hitting streak April 14, Newell has just started a new streak. He has hit safely now in eight games and has driven in at least one run in four of the last eight games.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s series will get under way on Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. First pitch drops back an hour each day as Saturday’s game will begin at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s matchup starts at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/","id":4673,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4672,4671,4670],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Ultimate Threat","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_78401.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_78401.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Playing sports growing up, you can usually play whatever position you want to.

She also took time off from her role as pitcher to play outfield and shortstop at times.</p>\n<p>This caught the eye of two-time Big West Coach of the Year, UCSB Head Coach Brie Galicinao, who had been following Wisdom’s progress since her freshman year.</p>\n<p>Despite not expecting to be getting starter’s playtime once she was recruited by UCSB, Wisdom was quickly given a chance to show what she could do. Again, she did not disappoint. As a freshman, she shattered the school record for strikeouts with 247, and even broke the record for single-season wins with 24.</p>\n<p>She also showed that despite the transition to college, she could still make a big difference hitting the ball, as proven by her .271 batting average and 22 RBIs. Her efforts earned her the Big West Freshman of the Year award as she solidified herself as one of the team’s best players despite being one of its youngest.</p>\n<p>“She’s obviously naturally talented and really athletic but she works her butt off,” Jeppesen said about Wisdom’s ability to play both sides of the ball. “She’s constantly doing extra work and pushing herself to be the best she can be, and that’s really been beneficial to the team.”</p>\n<p>Wisdom’s impact as an all-around player is evident in her numbers, but it’s felt in more than one way on the field.</p>\n<p>“She’s in the center of the field all the time and she sets the motion and the tempo for everyone else,” Jeppesen also said. “When she gets the big hits it inspires all of us to follow up after her and get more big hits and when she strikes everyone out it pumps us up for offense.”</p>\n<p>This season, Wisdom has had less pitching time as she has been backed up by a more solid pitching rotation. On the other hand, her offensive stats have skyrocketed, and she has spent a lot of her time outside the circle playing outfield where she has a .947 fielding percentage.</p>\n<p>“She always wants the ball, she practices hard, even when she’s in right field she’s usually one of the loudest players on the field, she’s just in every play and competing hard every single pitch,” Galicinao said. “Those are the kind of people that every coach wants and every team needs.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, whatever position she plays or role she has, Wisdom’s number one priority is doing whatever she can to help her team reach their ultimate goal: Big West champs. With Wisdom playing the way she does on both sides of the ball, it wouldn’t be surprising to see her accomplish that goal during her time here at UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/","id":1020,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1019,1018,1017],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Wide  Open Western Conference: San Antonio is Healthy and Ready to Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering the NBA postseason it was apparent the Miami Heat was once again the clear favorite to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals.

The Thunder needed every bit of his contribution against the Spurs, and with Reggie Jackson unlikely to match Westbrook’s production level on both ends of the floor, it looks unlikely OKC will return to the finals if it faces off against San Antonio.</p>\n<p>At this point in the postseason, San Antonio seems like the favorite to represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals not because they are the best team, but because they are the healthiest at this point in the season.</p>\n<p>That seemed like an unlikely statement only weeks ago.

It’s not a play that’s out of the ordinary, but in this case, Patrick Beverley of the Houston Rockets tried for the steal and ran into Westbrook’s knee, resulting in a lateral meniscus tear.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Westbrook is out for the remainder of the NBA season, marking the first time he has missed games in his career — high school, college or pro. Up until the injury, he appeared in an NBA-best 394 straight regular season games and played in all 45 of the Thunder’s playoff appearances.</p>\n<p>Westbrook’s absence leaves no clear taker in the Western Conference. Up 3-1 in the series with Houston, OKC will certainly advance to the next round, but without its all-star point guard, there is also doubt as to whether the team will make the NBA Finals for a second consecutive year.</p>\n<p>The West is a deep conference with seeds one through six all showing they have potential to go far into the postseason. When OKC defeats Houston, it will play the winner of the four/five series, which is a very close series between the L.A. Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies. Memphis would be a better matchup for the Thunder because Memphis is a more defensively-oriented team. However, the Clippers, with Blake Griffin and a deep pool of guards, including Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups, Eric Bledsoe and Jamal Crawford, could give the Thunder troubles on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>If the Thunder can get by L.A., they’ve probably got the best shot at taking the West, since San Antonio doesn’t have the young athleticism to come close to matching OKC. And the Golden State Warriors and Denver Nuggets both lack the experience and depth that OKC has.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that a team typically has to be peaking and playing its best basketball during the playoffs, the Thunder have the depth to still go all the way.</p>\n<p>Filling in for Westbrook is the young Reggie Jackson. He’s only a rookie and has little postseason experience as a result, but he is very athletic. The Thunder like to score, ranking third in the NBA with 105.7 points per game, and Jackson can certainly help the team do that.</p>\n<p>He’s a versatile athlete, and, like Westbrook, will push the ball. He certainly isn’t going to average Westbrook’s dynamite stat line of 23.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists per game, but Jackson has already stepped up for OKC. He’s averaged 11.8 points per game in the playoffs, over six more than his regular-season average. Without Westbrook, he’s increased that number to 16.0 points per game, proving he could be a solid role player for the Thunder down the stretch.</p>\n<p>OKC may be starting a rookie, but it has one of the best veteran point guards coming off the bench in Derek Fisher. Fisher is calm and poised with the ball and his past has definitely proved he can hit any shot no matter the pressure.</p>\n<p>Another offensive threat for the Thunder is guard Kevin Martin, who is great moving without the ball but can also knock down the three. He averages 14.0 points per game and shoots an impressive 42.6 percent from behind the arc, spreading the defense and clearing space for all-star Kevin Durant.</p>\n<p>Thabo Sefolosha isn’t going to look all that impressive on a box score, but he’s OKC’s defensive stopper and could cause havoc for guards like Stephen Curry or Manu Ginobli. On an offensively-minded team, Sefolosha brings the balance.</p>\n<p>Down low, Serge Ibaka is the big force for the Thunder. Extremely athletic, Ibaka has averaged 13.5 points and 3.5 blocks per game in the playoffs. It may be Ibaka that turns out to be the X-factor for OKC as he went off for 17 points in the first victory without Westbrook, but scored just eight in the loss Monday night. The Thunder may have lost a guard, but Ibaka’s production may determine how far the team goes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Oklahoma City Thunder now solely belong to Durant. The player who will finish second in MVP voting averaged an NBA second-best 28.1 points during the regular season. During the playoffs, Durant has only improved those numbers, averaging 33.0 points, 5.8 assists and 8.0 boards per contest as well as 48.8 shooting from the field. Without Westbrook, Durant will be the glaring focus for the other team, but so far he’s responded, dropping nearly 40 points in the two games without Westbrook.</p>\n<p>For Durant, it’s time to step up and put the team on his back. That’s what the best players do. If he wants to prove he should’ve been a true candidate for the MVP, this is the time. It’s his team and his chance to shine.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma City may be facing adversity, but now it has some extra motivation to make it back to the NBA finals. They’ll be playing with Westbrook in mind. Never doubt a team with something to prove.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Minchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51117\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51117\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/","id":3193,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3192,3191,3190],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":150,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
