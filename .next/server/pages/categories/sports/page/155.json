Only one game behind fifth place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings, the Gauchos will attempt to gain ground on the rest of the conference in their final road game of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB comes into tonight’s match with an overall record of 14-12 and a 10-10 mark in conference. Since returning back home in March after a month-long road trip, the Gauchos have been one of the hottest teams in the MPSF, winning nine out of their last 10 games, including seven straight.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos are coming off two impressive victories against the University of Hawaii on the road this past weekend, defeating the Warriors 3-1 on Friday and 3-0 on Saturday. UCSB has had difficulty on the road and entered last weekend’s series with a 2-8 mark away from home, but has now won four of its last five road games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal Baptist enters with an identical record to the Gauchos after defeating Pepperdine in its last conference game. However, the game will be nothing more than a friendly scrimmage for the Lancers, who are ineligible for the postseason this year.</p>\n<p>In the previous meeting between these two teams back in early February, the back-and-forth contest went the full five sets, with the Gauchos prevailing in a thrilling final game after being down earlier in the frame. It has been UCSB’s only five-set win this year.</p>\n<p>Three Gauchos had double-digit kills in that game including senior middle blocker Dylan Davis and sophomore opposite Matt Marsh, who both had a team-high 13 kills. Davis finished with an incredibly efficient .571 hitting percentage. Sophomore outside hitter Kevin Donohue also provided energy off the bench and contributed seven kills in the match.</p>\n<p>Despite winning the game, the Gauchos still had trouble defending the Lancer’s two Brazilians on the left side of the court. Sophomore outside hitter Guilherme Koepp had 21 kills in the game and hit for a .455 clip, second-best on the team. UCSB was more adept at containing the Lancers’ other Brazilian outside hitter, senior Levi Cabral, who had 16 kills but hit only .171.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara still has to account for Cabral on the service line, as he ranks third in the conference in service aces per set with 0.41, and his 4.14 kill average is fourth in the league overall.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB will rely on team captain Davis to provide offense and defense for the team. This season, Davis is second on the team in kills with 186, second in hitting percentage with a .467 clip and has totaled 133 blocks, the most of any Gaucho on the team.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/","id":5334,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5333,5332,5331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Contest Against Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team fell to Pepperdine Tuesday afternoon with a score of 3-1.

With one out, sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell doubled into left center field then proceeded to steal third base. Newell then came around to score on a ground out by freshman third baseman Ryan Clark.</p>\n<p>Freshman designated hitter David Oppenheim ended the Gauchos comeback hopes by doubling and scoring on a junior center fielder Ranny Lowe single in the top of the fourth. From that point on the bullpens for the Gauchos and Waves quieted the bats from the fourth inning on to the final score of 3-1.</p>\n<p>After the four-game weekend, the short staffed Gauchos used Lujan for just four innings as he allowed two earned runs before dipping into the bullpen for five scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine‘s Maurer pitched a gem, allowing just one run through seven innings of work, although he struck out just one batter.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Michael Swanner pitched a perfect ninth inning to close out the game and record his seventh save of the season for Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Coming up next for the Gauchos after some much needed rest will be a three-game weekend home series against their rivals from Cal Poly. The Mustangs will come down for a Friday 3 p.m. game, Saturday 2 p.m. game and a Sunday early afternoon showdown at 1p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50645\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50645\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/","id":4666,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4665,4664,4663],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Face Pepperdine at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_8300-by-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_8300-by-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB kicks off Spring Quarter with a home game today against Pepperdine University.

As a result, the Gauchos’ Big West record remains just 1-2, leaving them in sixth in the early goings of league play.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could trade that [win],” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We were not originally supposed to play a fourth one but Hawaii was short games and whenever you go to Hawaii those games don’t count towards your 56 game maximum, so we picked up the game, but I wish we could trade it with one of the losses.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pepperdine makes the trip to Caesar Uyesaka Stadium with a 15-11 record and a strong 6-3 West Coast Conference record. The Waves are coming off a three game series at BYU where they dropped the first two games in Utah before taking the final game of the series 9-6. Pepperdine will be concluding its five game road trip today.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine sophomore catcher Kolten Yamaguchi went 3-5 in the final game of the series against BYU and drove in two runs. In fact, Yamaguchi has been on a tear as of late. He has played in just 13 of the Waves 26 games, but leads the team with a .396 batting average, is tied for the team lead with four home runs and leads the team with a .688 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa and junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon headline the gaucho offense. Both had solid weekends in Hawaii as each drove in three runs. Trinkwon broke out in a big way in the final game in Hawaii with two hits, including a homerun, two runs scored and three RBI.</p>\n<p>Kuresa has continued his dominance as the most dangerous hitter in the Gauchos lineup. He has his average up to .294 with team leading seven doubles, two triples and a homerun, while his 20 RBI rank sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We are facing a left hander and we have swung the bats pretty well against left handers, so that’s in our favor.” Checketts said. “The lineup is also getting easier to write out because we have so many injuries right now and don’t have a whole lot of options. We had a really good effort by Dalton Kelly on the last weekend so he will be out there again.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outfielder Kelly went 6-11 with two triples and six RBI while in Hawaii to make a name for himself in this Gaucho lineup and out performed most anyone on the road trip.</p>\n<p>Heading into Tuesday’s game the Gauchos will be starting their third freshman starting pitcher in the last three games as the long weekend has taken its toll on the staff.</p>\n<p>“We are going to have to staff the game [today].” Checketts said. “We are a little thin on the mound and we used a lot of guys so Hector Lujan will start for us. He will go probably just a couple innings then we will use everyone else for an inning or so.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is slated for 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of April 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/","id":4664,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4663,4662,4661],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Finishes Strong in Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 17 Santa Barbara women’s water polo team returned from Hawaii this week having brought back some added momentum for April.

Hawaii’s attack featured a strong group of seniors led by attacker Monika Eggens.</p>\n<p>Eggens, who previously trained with the Canadian National Team, had a field day against the Gauchos with six goals in the first three quarters. Santa Barbara managed to retaliate in the final period with a 4-0 run; however, UCSB was unable to close upon a seven-point margin.</p>\n<p>“We knew those girls were really good,” Neushul said. “It’s hard to have a one-man show in Hawaii, but [Eggens] kind of was.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s showdown against Stanford provided some intriguing context as the match pitted UCSB coach Neushul against her daughter, Kiley. A sophomore driver for Stanford, Kiley was crowned the nation’s top collegiate women’s water polo player in 2012 as a freshman.</p>\n<p>In spite of the occurrence however, Coach Neushul was not perturbed by the circumstances.</p>\n<p>“I don’t even really notice that, and I don’t think she does either,” Neushul said. “You coach hundreds and hundreds of games, and I don’t really think of her as my daughter when I’m playing her.”</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB struggled to score against a Stanford squad that featured the nation’s top collegiate player and multiple U.S. Olympians, and the Gauchos were limited to three total goals. Despite the outcome, Neushul was pleased with the team’s effort.</p>\n<p>“It was actually a really good defensive battle,” Neushul said. “Some good things happened in that game that we used to build on the weekend.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would finally get over the hump Sunday with a strong 11-7 win over Sonoma State and a 12-9 victory against UC San Diego.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara cranked out the offense early against Sonoma with a 7-4 lead in the first half and held the Seawolves in check with four more goals in the final periods. Freshman goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had a game-high eight saves, and the UCSB offense was evenly distributed between five players tallying two goals each.</p>\n<p>“[Brokaw] got a lot of experience and she’s coming along [really well],” Neushul said. “The gap between the defense and offensive end has really started to narrow.”</p>\n<p>Against their conference rival, the Tritons, the Gauchos delivered again on the offensive end, compiling a 7-4 lead at the half. Freshmen utility Jessie Porter and Samantha Murphy led UCSB with three goals each to bolster Santa Barbara to a 12-9 finish.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos exit March having won seven of 10 games with a 1-2 record against Big West opponents. Santa Barbara stands at 18-10 overall but the club looks to capitalize on its conference record with four upcoming matches against Big West opponents.</p>\n<p>“Again, the record doesn’t matter so much as how you are seeded and end up in the conference tournament,” Neushul said. “As it stands right now, we’re all in this [complicated] tie situation.”</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara is next scheduled to face San Diego State at home Saturday, April 6.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50615\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-finishes-strong-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50615\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-finishes-strong-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-finishes-strong-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-finishes-strong-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-finishes-strong-in-hawaii/","id":5127,"author":{"id":362,"name":"Roy Kim"},"related":[5126,5125,5124],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Series Against Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While the rest of campus was in the midst of winter finals, the UCSB baseball team went 4-3 over the break in two weekend series and a solo game against Notre Dame.

The Gauchos went on a three-game winning streak by defeating Notre Dame and taking two out of three in a series against Sacramento State. The streak ended with a loss to Cal Poly on the road but Santa Barbara bounced back in a home game against the Mustangs before dropping a game three back in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>The UCSB baseball team finished up their spring break weekend with a four-game series at the University of Hawaii this past weekend. The Gauchos were victorious in game one but fell in games two and three to bring their record to 13-12 and 1-2 in Big West conference play. The Warriors move to a record of 7-17 on the year and 2-1 in the Big West. The four game series began Thursday when the Gauchos captured the first game of the series and continued through Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were led by sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa in game one against the Warriors where his three hits and three RBI propelled Santa Barbara to victory. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone was touched up for four runs through five and two-thirds innings but left the game with the lead. Sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle relieved Pettibone to escape the sixth but allowed a run in the seventh after two singles and a wild pitch put a runner in scoring position to score on a groundout.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the top of the ninth inning the Gauchos sophomore right fielder Luke Swenson began a rally with a single to lead off the inning. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon then sacrificed Swenson to second base to put the go ahead run in scoring position with the heart of the order coming up. The Warriors picked their poison by intentionally walking the clean-up hitter in freshman designated hitter Robert Nesovic, who since March 9 is hitting .366. The walk brought up Kuresa who would then double in both runners on the first pitch to take a two-run lead in the top of the ninth and seal the victory in game one 7-6.</p>\n<p>Game two on Friday was dominated by the Warriors senior starting pitcher Corey MacDonald. The Gauchos jumped to an early two-run lead in the top of the second but MacDonald would only allow just two more hits the rest of the game and go on to pitch a complete game, striking out six for his third win of the year.</p>\n<p>Gauchos starting pitcher freshman Justin Jacome had matched MacDonald through six innings of work but could not get out of the seventh inning as he and the Santa Barbara relievers relinquished four runs and the lead, falling 6-2 on the day.</p>\n<p>On Saturday the Gauchos fell again in Hawaii 6-4. Santa Barbara again scored first on a RBI double by Nesovic but freshman starting pitcher Kenny Chapman allowed a run in each inning from the second to the fifth. Chapman was kept from the decision thanks to a three-run home run by sophomore third baseman Peter Maris in the top of the fourth.</p>\n<p>With the game tied into the bottom of the eighth inning, Mahle, who had relieved Chapman in the fifth, walked the leadoff hitter and allowed a single before a double into right field by junior right fielder Connor George gave the Warriors the lead for the final time.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos will be a one game showdown at home against Pepperdine on Tuesday, April 2 at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/","id":4667,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4666,4665,4664],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Seventh Straight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Besides getting to spend spring break in Honolulu, the No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team also got to benefit from taking two games from the University of Hawaii this weekend, winning 3-1 on Frida...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Besides getting to spend spring break in Honolulu, the No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team also got to benefit from taking two games from the University of Hawaii this weekend, winning 3-1 on Friday and 3-0 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>After beginning the season 5-11, the Gauchos have been on a tear since, winning seven straight games and nine of their last 10.

Licht’s performance coupled with nine kills from sophomore outside hitter Austin Kingi was too much to overcome for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Licht has played a crucial part in the winning streak. In the seven games, he has led the Gauchos in kills in five of them and has totaled 87 during the span.</p>\n<p>Entering Friday’s game vying for a slot in the playoffs against a Hawaii team right on its tail, UCSB knew it had to come out with at least one victory but had the disadvantage of holding a 4-8 record on the road.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos never let the Warriors establish a rhythm on offense and disrupted the flow, despite allowing a .355 hitting percentage to Hawaii in set one. UCSB was able to outlast its opponent when senior outside hitter Miles Evans delivered the final kill for a 25-23 win to steal the first frame.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara displayed just how potent it can be on offense in the second set, hitting for a .440 clip en route to taking the set 25-21. Freshman setter Jonah Seif distributed the ball on-point in his first two sets and finished with 13 assists in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB seemed to be on the verge of completing its third consecutive sweep but Hawaii prevailed with excellent defense in third set and won 25-18. The comeback attempt fell short as the Gauchos closed out the match 25-22 in the fourth game to win 3-1</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to overcome a 10-6.5 difference in blocks thanks to the efficiency of Licht, Evans and senior middle blocker Dylan Davis. Combined, the trio accounted for 35 of UCSB’s 50 kills on the night.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now get ready for its final road game of the season against Cal Baptist on Wednesday before playing its last three regular season games at home.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50613\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50613\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/","id":5332,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5331,5330,5329],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Rally to Win Last Game of Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team ended its weekend with a bang, picking up a big win at University of the Pacific to end its four-game losing streak.

After falling just one run short in each of their last two games, UCSB was able to come up clutch on both sides of the ball in this one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had no hits through three innings, but that would change when they strung together three straight in the top of the fourth, capped off by sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom’s fifth home run of the season. The homer brought in Palomares and junior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil to give UCSB a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Tigers were able to tie the game in the bottom of the seventh on a single by senior infielder Megan Allen and the Gauchos found themselves in a do-or-die position with only one out and facing loaded bases.</p>\n<p>Pilpil came up with a clutch out by firing the ball home before Allen could come in for the winning run. The next batter popped out to center field and the game went into extra innings.</p>\n<p>Neither team found a breakthrough until the tenth inning when senior shortstop Keilani Jennings stepped up to the plate and knocked one of her team-leading seven home runs over left field to give the Gauchos a 4-3 lead. Junior infielder Jessica Reichner scored on an error to increase the lead to 5-3 and Wisdom picked up three straight outs to seal the win.</p>\n<p>“The difference between the last four games and this game is we continued to fight back and hit the ball harder,” Wisdom said about the win. “We can work on [having] a cleaner defense and stringing on hits.”</p>\n<p>The second game against Pacific on Saturday went down to the final pitch, but the Gauchos were unable to climb back from a 3-1 deficit in the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Going scoreless through the first five innings, UCSB scored its first run when Jennings doubled down the left field line to bring Pilpil home, making the score 2-1. A double by Allen in the bottom of the sixth extended the Tigers’ lead to 3-1, but the Gauchos kept fighting.</p>\n<p>Freshman catcher Sami Stark hit a clutch home run to start the seventh inning, bringing the Gauchos within one run. However, the next three Gaucho batters would be retired in succession, cutting the comeback short.</p>\n<p>The previous game against Pacific on Friday was a heartbreaker as Pacific took a 6-5 win off a throwing error by Jennings in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder McKenzie Kane gave one of her best efforts of the season with three RBI.</p>\n<p>“We were fighting really hard these last four games but the outcomes just didn’t end up in our favor,” Palomares said. “This last game we just stuck to our plan and kept the positive energy going.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have a break in conference play with two games at Arizona next weekend, the first of which is on Saturday at 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50611\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-rally-to-win-last-game-of-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50611\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-rally-to-win-last-game-of-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-rally-to-win-last-game-of-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-rally-to-win-last-game-of-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-rally-to-win-last-game-of-series/","id":988,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[987,986,985],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall in First Round of WNIT","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There may be no “I” in team, but there is in win and Wed. night, senior guard Courtney Clements propelled the San Diego State women’s basketball team to victory.

With the loss, the season officially comes to an end for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finished the season at 16-17 overall while San Diego St. improved to 27-6. The 27 victories mark the most in program history for a single season.</p>\n<p>“They’re good; I’m going to give them credit,” Mitchell said. “They played with a chip tonight and shot lights out. There’s nothing more you can say but they’re bigger, stronger and quicker. That’s the reality of it. I think our kids competed, but sometimes it’s just not your night and tonight was definitely not ours.”</p>\n<p>Despite the blowout, there was one huge bright spot for UCSB. Senior forward Sweets Underwood, who was held to just four points in the semifinals against Cal Poly, was looking for a better way to end her season. She entered Wednesday’s matchup with 999 points and wasted no time hitting the 1,000 point mark, nailing a jump shot less than three minutes into the game. She becomes the 24th Gaucho to enter the prestigious 1,000 point club.</p>\n<p>Underwood accounted for half of the Gauchos’ points, finishing with a career-high 23 points and nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of Sweets because I knew with the competitor she was, she was going to have a hard time staying in her skin for the next few weeks knowing the way she ended at Cal Poly,” Mitchell said. “That wasn’t the way she’s played all year long. I can smile now knowing she’s going to feel better about that.”</p>\n<p>The Aztecs set the tone from the beginning, playing with a chip on their shoulder after feeling like they deserved to make the NCAA Tournament. They never trailed in the game. On the very first possession, even with a defender right on her, Clements drained a three to give SDSU a 3-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>In fact, Clements had an answer every time the Gauchos tried to make a run. She scored 10 of her team’s first 12 points and with SDSU up 15-12, Clements knocked down a three which sparked a 12-0 run for the Aztecs.</p>\n<p>“We can’t allow one person to get lose,” Underwood said. “We couldn’t find a weapon to stop her and she hit everything tonight. That was the most difficult part. We were staying down, we would have a hand in their face and they would just it. It was her night tonight.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB’s offense became stagnant as the team went on a 7:42 scoring draught.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos entered halftime down 40-20. While UCSB is known for its defense, it had no answer for San Diego St., which shot 52.6 percent in the half, including 53.8 percent from behind the arc. In addition, with 21 points at halftime, Clements outscored UCSB on her own.</p>\n<p>To open the second half, the Aztecs continued to widen the gap, going up by 24 points. However, with a huge hole to climb out of, UCSB finally made a push to get back in the game. With 15:36 to go, junior guard Destini Mason hit a jumper to spark a 7-0 run. Mason was the only other player for Santa Barbara in double figures, tallying 10 points.</p>\n<p>“We knew we had to buckle down on defense,” Mason said. “We were there in their face and they knocked down some pretty hard shots, but we knew we got here with defense. We got some stops and tried to push it in transition.”</p>\n<p>In the first nine and a half minutes of the final period, the Gauchos outshot the Aztecs 41.7 percent to 23.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, the run did subside and it could do no better than trade baskets with San Diego St. the rest of the game. UCSB did play SDSU nearly even in the second half though, as the Aztecs only outscored the Gauchos 29-26.</p>\n<p>Similar to the semifinal against Cal Poly, UCSB was executing on the offensive end, but could not get its shots to fall. The team shot just 33.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“Coach at one point had to call a timeout and she told us to just relax and hit open shots,” Underwood said. “I think we were just a bit frazzled because they were hitting everything and we were thinking too much into our offense. We had to relax and be confident because they were open for us as well.”</p>\n<p>While the box score doesn’t reflect it, the Gauchos didn’t play poorly. The Aztecs were simply the superior team on that night.</p>\n<p>“I think we came out to really play,” Mason said. “We played pretty good defense; they were just knocking down some really good shots. As a team, this is a better way to go out than against Cal Poly. For the seniors, you didn’t want them to go out that way. I’m glad the seniors got the opportunity to play one more time.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50604\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-22/gauchos-fall-in-first-round-of-wnit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50604\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-22/gauchos-fall-in-first-round-of-wnit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-22/gauchos-fall-in-first-round-of-wnit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-22/gauchos-fall-in-first-round-of-wnit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-22/gauchos-fall-in-first-round-of-wnit/","id":629,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[628,627,626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to SDSU for WNIT Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s rare that in sports, or life for that matter, that you get a second chance.

We have nothing to lose.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last game resulted in a devastating 62-43 loss to rival Cal Poly in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament. Although UCSB got off to a fantastic start, holding the Mustangs to 0-8 shooting to begin the game, the Gauchos struggled to score the basketball, shooting just 34.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Add to that a 20-point second half from Cal Poly’s 6’5’’ junior center Molly Schlemer and UCSB began to watch its season potentially come to an end. However, three days later, the Gauchos became of one of four Big West teams selected for the WNIT. This marks the second straight postseason appearance in Mitchell’s two-year reign.</p>\n<p>“It’ll help us to have a little edge because we’re still upset about that [game] and we don’t like how that game potentially could’ve ended our season,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I think that’s going to put some fuel to our fire and if anything, it’s going to motivate us for this game coming up tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>San Diego State will also enter tomorrow’s matchup looking for redemption. The Aztecs had a spectacular season, posting a 15-1 Mountain West record to win the regular season title for the second straight year. The team also won 17 consecutive games and tied the program record for most wins in a single season. As a result of winning its conference, SDSU earned an automatic bid to the WNIT, but fell short of going to the NCAA Tournament when it lost to Fresno State in the Mountain West Tournament Championship.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious that they’re extremely athletic and I’m sure they feel like they should be in the NCAA Tournament with the record that they have,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’m sure they’ll come out and we’ll probably see one of their best games.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos are 12-18 against San Diego State. However, the last time these two teams faced off was Jan. 2, 1999 and UCSB won 78-50.</p>\n<p>Dominating the conference, the Aztecs rank first in the Mountain West in scoring defense, holding teams to 52.4 points per game. However, San Diego St. is an offensive minded team, averaging 68.7 points per game while shooting 43.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge for SDSU is senior guard Courtney Clements, who ranks second in the Mountain West and first on the team in scoring with 17.5 points per game. In addition, senior guard Chelsea Hopkins, a transfer from Duke, averages 13.5 points, 8.1 rebounds and 6.8 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>“Hopkins likes to get in the paint,” Mitchell said. “She can knock down a three, but she wants to get in the gaps and make things happen. And with Clements, you have to contest the shot. You can’t foul her or give her open looks from three. You want to try and make her put it on the floor and make her a jump shooter.”</p>\n<p>Of course, SDSU will be facing the toughest defensive team in the Big West as UCSB holds teams to a conference leading 52.4 points per game and 35.8 shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“Defense is our identity, so like always for us, we have to play defense and get stops,” Aguirre said.</p>\n<p>The final step in defense is rebounding and Santa Barbara ranks first in the Big West in rebounding defense, holding its opponents to 32.5 boards per game, which will be especially important against the Aztecs, which typically grab 41 rebounds per game. In addition, if UCSB can keep SDSU off the boards, they will likely be able to shut down 6’6’’ senior center Malia Nahinu, who averages nearly eight points per game off of rebound putbacks.</p>\n<p>“Watching film of them, Fresno State didn’t have anyone at [Nahinu’s] size and they were able to push her away from the basket,” Mitchell said. “She’ll get a lot of points if you don’t block her out on rebound putbacks, but she’s a different type of player than Schlemer. And we’ve seen 6-6 throughout the year.”</p>\n<p>Offensively for the Gauchos, senior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team, averaging 11.8 points and 9.2 rebounds per game. She also shoots 48.3 percent from the field. In the backcourt, Nesbit paces the team, averaging 10.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB shoots 40.2 percent from the field, but struggled to make easy shots against Cal Poly. However, the Gauchos are best when they can get out, run and make some easy baskets in transition.</p>\n<p>“We need to make them have to work in transition defense and we’ve seen from day one that most of the time our easy baskets come in transition if we have an attack mentality,” Mitchell said. “That will be the main thing and then you have to knock down shots. At some point, if you have 12 and 15 foot jumpers, you have to be willing and confident enough to step up and knock them down.”</p>\n<p>The WNIT Tournament is composed of 64 Division I teams and is single elimination. The first round begins tomorrow and will conclude Friday.</p>\n<p>Tipoff against San Diego State is set for 4 p.m. at Viejas Arena.</p>\n<p><em> This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/","id":625,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[624,623,622],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Season Ended in Big West Tournament\nSemifinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There will be no miracle run and no Big West Championship for the UCSB women’s basketball team this year.

A 62-43 loss to Cal<br>\nPoly yesterday in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament not<br>\nonly dashed any hopes of becoming back-to-back conference<br>\nchampions, but also ended the Gauchos’ season. “I don’t like<br>\nlosing. I don’t care what the name is on the jersey,” Head Coach<br>\nCarlene Mitchell said. “In the program I’m associated with, you<br>\nexpect to win every time you step on the court. All I can go off of<br>\nin my second year here is that last year I was sitting up here on<br>\nthis podium with a lot better feeling than I am right now.” Santa<br>\nBarbara finished the year at 16-16 overall, going 11-7 in<br>\nconference play. The Mustangs improved to 20-10 and will play for<br>\nthe tournament championship today. The loss is the third straight<br>\nto Cal Poly this year for UCSB. This also marks the first time that<br>\nthe Gauchos have lost to the Mustangs during the postseason. “The<br>\nrecord may not indicate the growth that we had and the competitive<br>\nspirit we had throughout the year, but I’m extremely proud,”<br>\nMitchell said. “This was a group that I was excited to go to<br>\npractice with every day and step on the court and go to battle<br>\nwith.” In every matchup, UCSB was unable to find an answer for 6-5<br>\nMolly Schlemer. Although the Gauchos were able to hold the junior<br>\ncenter to six points in the first half, Schlemer went off for 20 in<br>\nthe second half. “She’s the Big West Player of the Year and we knew<br>\nthey were going to go into her,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman<br>\nsaid. “There’s only so much we can do and I think we did play very,<br>\nvery good defense against her. A player like that’s going to get<br>\nher shots.” While the final score might not reflect it, UCSB got<br>\noff to a great start. The best defensive team in the Big West held<br>\nthe Mustangs to 0-8 shooting to start the game, including 0-6 from<br>\nthree-point range. “Defense is our identity, so we came out with a<br>\nlot of energy, trying to not give them their easy points that<br>\nthey’ve gotten in the past,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said.<br>\n“That was our mindset – take away what they like to do.” Aguirre,<br>\nwho has played extremely well against Cal Poly this season,<br>\naveraging 11 points in the two matchups, caught fire early, scoring<br>\nSanta Barbara’s first two baskets. Then, Tilleman, last year’s Big<br>\nWest Tournament MVP, got in on the action, knocking down two<br>\nstraight baskets of her own to give the Gauchos an 8-2 lead. “I<br>\njust try do what I need to do,” Aguirre said. “I try to be<br>\naggressive and take open shots. We knew we had to be the aggressors<br>\nfrom the beginning, so I think all of us had that mindset.”<br>\nHowever, Cal Poly was never out of the game and drained<br>\nback-to-back threes to take a 12-10 lead. The score remained close<br>\nthe remainder of the half and the Mustangs eventually took a 22-19<br>\nlead into halftime. After starting the game 0-8, the Mustangs shot<br>\n9-16 for 56.3 percent the rest of the half. UCSB, meanwhile, was<br>\ntaking good shots, but was unable to convert shots it would usually<br>\nmake, shooting just 30.4 percent from the field. “I thought the<br>\nkids competed extremely well in the first half and shots didn’t<br>\nfall,” Mitchell said. “We got a lot of wide open looks and<br>\nsometimes you can only play the pressure defense for so long and<br>\nthen you have to get a point here or there to be able to keep that<br>\nup.” Cal Poly went to its Big West Player of the Year to start the<br>\nsecond half and Schlemer answered the call, scoring four straight<br>\npoints and sparking a 13-2 run to put SB in a 12 point hole. The<br>\nGauchos didn’t help their cause though, turning the ball over six<br>\ntimes and going 1-7 in first seven and a half minutes of play. “You<br>\ntry to full front [Schlemer] and they’ll lob over the top,”<br>\nMitchell said. “You try to play behind her and double and they have<br>\nblue-collar players that can knock down the 15 foot jumper.” As<br>\ntime went on, Santa Barbara continued to fall part as it could do<br>\nno better than just trade baskets with Cal Poly. The deficit<br>\ncontinued to grow and became too much to overcome. Despite holding<br>\nCal Poly to 22 points in the first half, the Mustangs unleashed<br>\ntheir potent offense in the second half, scoring 40 points compared<br>\nto UCSB’s 24. Overall, Cal Poly shot 43.8 percent from the field<br>\nand outscored the Gauchos 22-12 in the paint. Defensively, Cal Poly<br>\nlimited UCSB’s leading scorer, senior forward Sweets Underwood, to<br>\njust four points, nearly eight below her average. For the Gauchos,<br>\njunior guard Nicole Nesbit paced the team offensively, scoring 11<br>\npoints, all of which came in the second half. Aguirre also<br>\ncontributed 11 points while Tilleman added 10 rebounds in the<br>\ndefeat. “I don’t think we can ever be satisfied with not getting to<br>\nthe NCAA Tournament, but it’s also not about just this one game,”<br>\nTilleman said. “It’s about the journey we took as a team and the 32<br>\ngames that we played. So, I’m not satisfied, but I feel that we<br>\nlearned a lot this season and I’m going to take a lot from playing<br>\nwith these people and playing for this program.” The game marked<br>\nthe last time playing in a Gaucho uniform for seniors Aguirre,<br>\nTilleman and Underwood.

Underwood recorded a game-high 16 points and nine rebounds while Nesbit tallied 12 points on 6-9 shooting and a team-high three assists.</p>\n<p>“Sweets has done an amazing job all year long of being calm and being very consistent in her play,” Mitchell said. “She’s a senior, she wants to keep her season alive and she stepped up and made big plays.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team in the first half, scoring eight of her 12 points in the opening period. Back-to-back jumpers from Nesbit capped off an 8-1 from UCSB to give the team a 12-5 lead early in the game.</p>\n<p>From there, the first half became a defensive stalemate, as one might expect from the top two defensive teams in the Big West. After a five minute scoring drought for both teams, the Gauchos finally grabbed the momentum, ending the half on a 6-0 run to take a 22-13 lead into the locker rooms.</p>\n<p>“I think we started attacking more,” Underwood said. “In that last timeout, Coach Mitch emphasized to us that transition is our best offense, so we had to get to the paint and attack them — try to score as many points in the paint as we could.”</p>\n<p>Northridge’s 13 points ties for fifth in the UCSB record book for fewest points by an opponent in a first half.</p>\n<p>“When I walked into the locker room, I went crazy on the team, even though everyone thinks I’m really calm most of the time,” Mitchell said. “When I huddled them up for the second half, I told them, ‘you’re right. You know I’m crazy, but you just held a team to 13 points.’ And 13 just happens to be my lucky number.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s didn’t let go of its lead in the second half as the Matadors were unable to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to fewer than seven points.</p>\n<p>“We always stress the first four minutes of each half to set the tone,” Nesbit said. “When we came out in the second half, we knew that we just needed to keep our lead going and extend it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did in fact continue to build on their lead. Beginning with two free throws from Underwood after an intentional foul call on Northridge, Underwood caught fire, scoring eight straight points to give UCSB its largest lead of the game at 41-25 with just under five minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a physical game, but a key part of our team is mental toughness,” Underwood said. “Our motto is, ‘don’t let anything hold you back,’ so it’s just about brushing it off, even if you get fouled on the shot. It’s always the next play and the next shot you have.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, Santa Barbara held Northridge to 31 points on 24 percent shooting, including 0-12 from three-point range. UCSB becomes the only team this season to shutout the Matadors from behind the arc this season. The Gauchos also outrebounded the Matadors 37-29.</p>\n<p>“They did a great job [defensively],” Mitchell said. “We worked extremely hard on defensive end. This time of the year, hopefully it wins you some games.”</p>\n<p>Winning in the Bren Events Center, the same arena where the playoff run began one year ago and resulted in a Big West Championship for UCSB, the Gauchos enter the semifinals tomorrow with momentum. However, they know that it’s a new year and will have to overcome a Cal Poly team they have yet to beat.</p>\n<p>“It’s March Madness,” Nesbit said. “We know what we’re capable of looking at last year, but this year is a completely different year. We have our goals set, and we’re trying to achieve them.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off tomorrow is set for approximately 2:30 p.m. at the Honda Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50592\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50592\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/","id":626,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[625,624,623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Begin Postseason Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s almost like déjà-vu.

In its final regular season game on the road, Santa Barbara defeated the Aggies for the first time in seven games to enter playoffs in stride. Then, as the underdog sixth seed, it then went on to win three straight games and win the Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>“We all know that it’s win or go home, so there’s no reason I should have to light a fire under them or have to find some crazy way to motivate them,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We were in the same situation last year and they should remember at least those emotions from what we’re going to have to do to win three games in a row.”</p>\n<p>However, the team also knows back-to-back titles won’t come easy as the reigning Big West Tournament Champions have an extra target on its back in an already competitive conference.</p>\n<p>“I told them, ‘it can’t be shazam.’ There’s no magic wand that’s going to allow it happen like it did last year.” Mitchell said. “That was a perfect script. I’d like it to be rewritten that exact same way, but it’s not going to happen. Every other team in the conference is a lot better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins postseason play tomorrow night in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament at UC Irvine, the same location the Gauchos started their championship run last year. After earning a bye through the first round of play as a result of securing fourth place, Santa Barbara will play the highest remaining seed after tonight’s first round games.</p>\n<p>That means the Gauchos could see Long Beach state, Cal state Northridge or UC Davis, teams that they have gone 5-1 against during regular season play.</p>\n<p>“We’ve beaten them all, so it doesn’t matter who we play,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “It’s going to be an all-out battle no matter who we play, but we’ll be ready for them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished conference play at 11-7 and enter tonight’s game at 15-15 overall. Yet, UCSB knows that none of that matters now when it’s win or go home.</p>\n<p>“Like coach said, we’re 0-0 now,” Nesbit said. “Everything’s kind of starting over. I think we’re excited to have a clean slate going into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>The only thing UCSB hopes to take into the playoffs is its momentum as the Gauchos have won their last three games.</p>\n<p>“[The momentum is] something we need to carry us through the tournament, but it’s a completely different mindset,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “It’s about showing up on any given day and being the best team in the end. It’s do or die.”</p>\n<p>In its last game at home for senior day, Santa Barbara won back-to-back home games for the first time this season, defeating UC Irvine 49-40. The game began with a perfect script for UCSB as its three seniors each scored a basket to start the game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Down the stretch, offensive rebounds earned the Gauchos the victory. A second chance basket by senior forward Sweets Underwood gave UCSB a four point lead with 50 seconds to go and would be enough to secure the win.</p>\n<p>“I think that at different times in the game, different people stepped up,” Mitchell said. “We made plays. I’m proud of our kids and finding a way to pull it out late in the game.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos won’t be playing at home, that might prove beneficial for UCSB. Santa Barbara has played some of its best basketball on the road and enters the Tournament with the second-best road record in the Big West at 8-5.</p>\n<p>Not knowing which team it will face, UCSB has had no other option but to focus on itself.</p>\n<p>“We have the skills, we have the talent and we know what we have to do, but it’s just doing that from the tip to the final buzzer,” Tilleman said. “Now during tournament play, everyone’s going to show up playing their best game, so we can’t have lapses where we’re not getting things done, so it’s having that focus and having that leadership.”</p>\n<p>All season long, UCSB has won games with its defense. The team ranks first in scoring defense and field goal percentage defense, holding its opponents just 52.8 points per game and 36.0 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Defense will be especially critical not only to slow down the other team, but it also fuels the Gauchos’ offense. Santa Barbara is at its best when it can get out in transition.</p>\n<p>“Everything runs through our defense,” Tilleman said. “Especially in these last few games, it’s obvious that we’re best offensively when we get a stop on defense and we can transition. If we let them score, we have to get into a set offense and they get to get into their defense.”</p>\n<p>Despite ranking last in scoring offense, UCSB ranks third in field goal percentage, shooting 40.2 percent from the field. Execution will be very important for the Gauchos entering postseason play, considering the fact that they will most likely see zone defenses the majority of the tournament, which they have struggled against at times.</p>\n<p>“Our offensive execution is more mental than anything, so we know that when we have to score, we will,” Nesbit said. “We just have to relax on offense, trust the patterns and just play basketball because Coach gives us all the freedom in the world. We have to know what to do with it.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos offensively is Underwood, who was named to the Big West first team Monday. Underwood ranks tenth in the Big West in scoring with 11.9 points per game, fourth in rebounding with 9.3 per game and third in field goal percentage at 48.7 percent.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB is not a team that relies on one player and has many who can step up. Nesbit, an All-Big West honorable mention this season, averages 10.6 points per game and junior guard Melissa Zornig averages 8.4 points per game. Senior guard Angelei Aguirre, junior guard Destini Mason and Tilleman have all proved they can step up when needed as well.</p>\n<p>“Every player has played critical roles in helping us win games and that’s how we want to approach the tournament,” Mitchell said. “They’ve all been there, they’ve all helped us win different games in different ways and they should all be confident and know that at any moment, they’re name could be called.”</p>\n<p>This year, UCSB is a veteran team. The team returns eight of its 11 players from last year’s roster that took the conference tournament title, so experience could give Santa Barbara the edge.</p>\n<p>“The games are back to back to back and you’re just out there having fun,” Nesbit said. “It’s an exciting time of the year – March Madness. This is what any college player is waiting for, so we’re excited.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Wednesday at the Bren Events Center is set for 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first game, which begins at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Playing on senior day and in its final game of the regular season, Santa Barbara improved to 11-7 in conference and returned to .500 at 15-15 overall. The Anteaters, on the other hand, finished their regular season with a 5-13 league record and a 9-21 overall mark.</p>\n<p>“I told [the seniors] before the game started that we still have a lot of basketball left, but this is a day where the community, the fans and their teammates can show their appreciation of what they’ve meant to this program on and off the court,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “As a coach, I’ll come back and thank them in a year or two. Until then, I’ve still got to ride their butts for three more games and then I’ll think about what the future will be like without them. Until that point, I want them to enjoy this day. It’s a special day.”</p>\n<p>A better beginning to the game could not have been written for the Gauchos, whose seniors came out on fire. On the very first play of the afternoon, senior forward Sweets Underwood came up with a block and Tilleman secured the defensive rebound.</p>\n<p>On the opposite end of the floor, UCSB went straight to its high-low game. A pass from Tilleman to Underwood down low put Santa Barbara up 2-0. The Gauchos’ second basket came on a 15-foot jumper from senior guard Angelei Aguirre. Then, with a layup from Tilleman, UCSB went up 6-0 and very fittingly, all three of UCSB’s seniors had scored.</p>\n<p>“We had it scripted. I don’t know if you guys knew that, but the seniors would score the first three buckets of the game, so it was all a plan,” Mitchell joked after the game. “Once again, I’m brilliant.”</p>\n<p>A baseline jumper from Tilleman put the Gauchos up 10-5 with all 10 points coming from the seniors. However, as both teams settled into the game, turnovers began to plague both sides. 11 combined turnovers in the first 11 minutes of play resulted in a sloppy game with neither team able to establish any sort of rhythm offensively.</p>\n<p>“They play a really high and wide zone, often a 1-3-1,” Tilleman said. “We’ve always struggled with that and we do best when we’re doing transition offense and don’t have to run anything, so I think it just took us a while to respond to that. [Irvine] was our first game of conference play and our last, so I think we improved, but we still have a lot of room to get better against those types of defenses.”</p>\n<p>UCSB went down 10-12, but was down for a total of just 26 seconds as the team finally found its stride, responding with an 8-1 run. However, the Gauchos started missing easy shots, finishing the half on 1-5 shooting. As a result, Santa Barbara entered halftime up by just one point at 20-19.</p>\n<p>“We got a lot of open looks today,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes they don’t fall, but if you continue to be consistent in the other areas you can control, it gives you an opportunity to win like it did tonight.”</p>\n<p>Up two with just over two minutes remaining, UCSB continued to earn itself possessions through hustle plays, keeping control of the ball for 1:15. Tilleman rebounded the ball on the defensive end and then went to work on the offensive glass, knocking the ball off of Irvine to earn Santa Barbara control of the ball.</p>\n<p>After junior guard Nicole Nesbit was fouled at half court, she took the inbounds pass and drove to the basket. Despite missing the layup, Underwood was there for the offensive board. Missing the first putback attempt, Underwood continued to go after the ball, grabbing her own miss and converting the second chance layup to put the Gauchos up 43-39 with 50 seconds to go.</p>\n<p>“Our team plays well when our backs are against the wall,” Underwood said. “We know we will give it our all to get that win. So I’m thinking, ‘okay I missed the first layup. I’m going to get this rebound and lay it back up.’”</p>\n<p>After a missed shot by Irvine, the Anteaters were forced to play the fouling game. Nesbit went 6-6 from the free throw line down the stretch, icing the game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Overall, Nesbit scored a game-high 17 points while Underwood and Tilleman finished with 12 and eight points, respectively. Junior guard Destini mason grabbed a team-high 11 boards for UCSB and Aguirre tallied a team-high four assists.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, UCSB was solid once again, holding the Anteaters to 23.1 percent shooting and outrebounding them 38-33.</p>\n<p>“I want our team to take pride in knowing if the team should only have 30 points, let’s only let them score 30,” Mitchell said. “We take a lot of pride in our defense. I don’t think that’s anything new to this group, but it will help us win a lot of games, especially as we get to March Madness.”</p>\n<p>While the game has no postseason implications, Santa Barbara knows the importance of entering playoffs with momentum.</p>\n<p>“You always want to win your last one and our last one just happened to be senior day for us,” Mitchell said. “We haven’t really worried about the record up until this point because now we understand that we’re 0-0. You’re next game is your last game, so these kids will know that every night, we’re backed into a corner and that’s how we’ll have to play is game by game.”</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West Tournament Champions have now won three straight games and back-to-back home games for the first team this season.</p>\n<p>“There’s no magic wand that’s going to allow it to happen like it did last year,” Mitchell said. “That was a perfect script. I’d like it to be rewritten that exact same way, verbatim, but it’s not going to happen. Every other team in the conference is a lot better. You have Pacific and Hawaii that we know we can beat and you have Cal Poly, who at this point last year I think was undefeated or had one loss, so it’s kind of ironic how everything’s set back up where if we take care of ourselves, then we could put ourselves in that position again.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin postseason play Wednesday, playing the highest remaining seed from Tuesday’s first round games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Bryson finished with 14 points and five rebounds while Brown tallied 11 points and eight boards.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s encouraging that [Taran] got some boards,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I think it’s encouraging that he got to the rim and got two dunks. It’s a step up for him.”</p>\n<p>The Titans were unable to slow down UCSB’s inside game as they were outscored 40-14 in the paint. Fullerton sported a four or five guard lineup for the entirety of the game, with its lone forward being 6’7” junior James ‘Deuce’ Douglas.</p>\n<p>Without senior guard D.J. Seeley and senior forward Sammy Yeager, Fullerton’s second and third leading scorers, the Titans looked nothing like the team that entered last night’s game as the eighth team in the nation in points scored per game with 78.4. The Titans’ 50 points is a season low, the previous season low in scoring being 55, which came in a loss to Pacific last weekend.</p>\n<p>“It was different than the first time we played them when they were just running and gunning,” Big Al said. “I think they wanted to save their legs because they didn’t have all their guys; they’re pretty banged up like we are. We played solid, we held them to one shot most of the time and we were able to get out in the break for our advantage.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton featured a usual offense for a high-scoring team, holding the ball at the top of the key, often waiting to attack until only 10 to 15 seconds remained on the shot clock. The Titans ranked either first or second in the conference in the three major shooting percentages entering the contest, but finished with an unusually low .200 three-point shooting percentage, .591 free throw percentage and .354 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>“When we were disciplined and moved the ball and got great shots … we were pretty effective,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I had no idea they would come in, hold the ball and go delay. They played fast, but only in the last 15 seconds of the shot clock.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton featured an effective one-man full court press on UCSB’s point guard for the majority of the game, causing nine of the Gauchos’ 14 turnovers in the first half.</p>\n<p>Up 23-22 at the half, UCSB came out aggressive to open the second half, going on a 14-4 run and never trailing in the second half. UCSB outperformed Fullerton on the boards as well, outrebounding the Titans 42-25.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Nate Garth returned to action for UCSB after an eight game absence due to a left hamstring injury, but was limited in action, receiving only one minute of play. He will be the lone senior honored on Saturday for senior night.</p>\n<p>“He just brings a presence that you want to play harder,” Bryson said. “He’s a very smart basketball player, so it makes you want to play harder for him and play smarter. If he’s just with us, we’re going to be a better team.”</p>\n<p>Riverside previously defeated UCSB 54-45 at home, so the Gauchos will look for revenge against the Highlanders with a chance to officially lock up the seventh seed for next week’s Big West Conference Tournament in Anaheim.</p>\n<p>“It’s a new season now,” Big Al said. “We’re going to be happy for about five more minutes and get ready for Riverside on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff for Saturday’s contest against Riverside is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1447241361\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50577\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/local-organization-opposes-beach-revamp-asks-county-to-reevalute/mensbasketball_markbrocher_03-07-2013_dsc_1214/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1362687406\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50571\" alt=\"MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>MARK BROCHER/ DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Six of their 15 wins have been decided by one run and/or in extra innings, and they are 8-0 in games decided by three runs or less.</p>\n<p>“Our motto this year is resilience and I think we’re really resilient,” senior outfielder Jessica Soria said. “Even if a team punches us really hard, we punch back harder.”</p>\n<p>Up next for UCSB is South Alabama, a team on a roll with a five game winning streak and an 18-2 record. The Jaguars have been excellent behind their pitching squad, led by junior Hannah Campbell and sophomore Farish Beard. The two have dominated with ERAs of 0.85 and 1.24, respectively, and the team as a whole has only given up 30 runs in 20 games this season.</p>\n<p>Against these great pitchers, the Gauchos will need to be on their mark offensively.
