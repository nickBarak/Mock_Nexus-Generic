If Santa Barbara earns two victories, it clinches the Big West championship.</p>\n<p>At 15-9 overall and 10-2 in the conference, UCSB has its destiny in its own hands.

They are led on offense by senior right side Alyse Hensley and senior outside hitter Bre Moreland, both averaging over three kills per set.</p>\n<p>Moreland also leads a defense that averages the most digs of any team in the Big West. With an average of 3.59 digs per set, Moreland has the highest average of any non-libero in the Big West.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Highlanders might still be looking for the first win in over two months. With the lowest offensive statistics and blocks per set average in the conference, Riverside will be fighting hard to get the first conference win of a disappointing season.</p>\n<p>“Each team we go up against we’re going to have to be extremely ready and fired up to play,” Lantagne Welch said. “Every one of them we just need to take one at a time and go from there.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has won games all season without a top offensive unit, as they average just the fifth most kills per set in the Big West. At third in blocks per set, their defense has been one of their strength.</p>\n<p>Freshman middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg have dominated the middle with averages of 1.23 and 1.10 blocks per set, good for first and fourth in the conference, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior Leah Sully has been a key in both the defense and the passing game in her twelve starts at libero this season. Her 3.83 digs per set are fourth best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>On offense, senior opposite Katey Thompson boasts the conference’s third most kills per set with an average of 3.36. Freshman outside hitter and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau back Thompson up with solid averages of 2.73 and 2.52, respectively.</p>\n<p>This weekend, the Gauchos play their final homestand of the year against the two teams at the bottom of the standings, a favorable matchup for a team that can almost taste the finish line.</p>\n<p>“We’re all super excited; we want to win the Big West so bad,” freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt said. “We’re just going to keep doing what we’ve been doing, working hard in practice, and I think we’re going to pull it out.”</p>\n<p>The match against Fullerton begins at 7 p.m. on Friday at home, and the match with Riverside will also be set to begn at 7 p.m. on Saturday in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53143\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53143\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/","id":5282,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5281,5280,5279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Quest for a National Title Starts at Harder","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccer_CalPoly-DustinHarris-11092013-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccer_CalPoly-DustinHarris-11092013-11.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"The Tenth Seeded Gauchos Host the Second Round of the NCAA Playoffs Sunday ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Only 48 teams in the nation remain in the chase for the NCAA Championship, and by the time the UCSB men’s soccer team takes the field Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, that number will be down to 32.</p>\n<p>UCSB, which received the No. 10 seed in the tournament, will face the winner of Penn State and St. Francis Brooklyn, who square off today.

Santa Barbara secured a tournament seed despite falling in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament to Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited for the tournament,” senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “We’re fortunate enough to get a bye and a home game and we’re fired up to get a win off a tough loss.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will however play shorthanded on Sunday. Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez and freshman midfielder Drew Murphy both received red cards during last week’s loss to Northridge and will be forced to sit out of Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Gauchos may be without a pair of seniors in forward Achille Campion and defender Peter Schmetz due to injury.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t really probably going to get an answer [on injuries] until closer to Saturday,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re pretty optimistic that Campion will be playing, at least try to play. Schmetz is probably a little bit of a longer shot. At the end of the day, it’ll be a game time decision really.”</p>\n<p>Penn State enters today’s contest as the host, finishing the regular season with an 11-5-2 overall and 5-1 mark in the Big Ten, good enough for a regular season conference title.</p>\n<p>“No matter who we play, it’s all going to come down to who has the energy and who’s ready to show up on Sunday,” Baiden said. “No matter who we play, we just need to make sure we come out with a ton of energy and make sure we get our goals to get the win.”</p>\n<p>St. Francis Brooklyn, meanwhile, finished the season 12-5-1 and 4-3 in conference, closing out the season with a three-game winning streak and a Northeast Conference Tournament title.</p>\n<p>“Our focus has really been on our own preparation. We do know a lot more about Penn State because they’re a little bit more out there, they’ve played some people we’re familiar with,” Vom Steeg said. “We literally know nothing about St. Francis. What we do know is someone is going to have to travel 3,000 miles to have to play us on Sunday.”</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB in the NCAA Tournament from the Big West include No. 15 Northridge and No. 13 UC Irvine. This is the first time in conference history three teams have qualified for the tournament, and even more impressively, the first time three teams have received a top 16 ranking and a first round bye.</p>\n<p>“It is historical. To have the three teams out of the Big West seeded that’s really remarkable and speaks a lot about the quality of the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “Realistically, think about how tough it was to go undefeated in conference play during a year when two other teams are seeded in the tournament.”</p>\n<p>This is the 11th time in the last 12 seasons the Gauchos have made a postseason appearance. UCSB is 11-1 all-time in NCAA Tournament matches played at home and can add to its already impressive postseason legacy on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to find a way to win on Sunday and if we can do that I think we have a good chance to win the next game,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s hard enough to miss two all-league performers but now you add two other starters and it’s going to make it real tough.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Sunday’s NCAA Tournament second round match is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November 21’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/","id":1568,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1567,1566,1565],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel North for First Road Trip of the Season, See Tough Competition Tonight vs. St. Mary’s","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/USED__W_Basketball_N16_Margarita_Baliyan_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/USED__W_Basketball_N16_Margarita_Baliyan_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels north to St. Mary's, Santa Clara","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team embarks on its first road trip of the season today, travelling north to take on St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the game with a 1-1 overall record while the Gaels seek to stay perfect, as the experienced squad holds a 3-0 record.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “They’ve played good competition.

We know we’re at and that we can hang with the Pac-12. It’s just a conference.”</p>\n<p>The most critical error for UCSB was in the rebounding column. The Wildcats outrebounded the Gauchos 40-32, including 24-14 in the second half, grabbing critical offensive rebounds that gave Arizona extra opportunities.</p>\n<p>“It was different players at different phases of the game and two or three of them were at the free throw line,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “That’s a lack of focus and a lack of discipline. I think our kids will write it across their chests to not let those same mistakes happen.”</p>\n<p>Against top competition, UCSB continued to see consistent production from its three seniors. On the season, Nesbit leads the team, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals per game. Mason has tallied 13 points and 5.0 rebounds per game and senior guard Melissa Zornig has added 5.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>“[The seniors are] above and beyond expectations,” Mitchell said. “In year number three, I can communicate with them on a different level. With Nic, Mel and Destini, they’ve been ultimate leaders and a pleasure.”</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, the Gauchos will have to deal with a very tall team. While the average height for Santa Barbara is 5’9’’, the Gaels measure in at an average height of 5’11’’. The defense will especially be tested as starting center senior Carli Rosenthal is 6’3’’.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s also features taller guards, headlined by senior guard Jackie Nared. At 6’1’’, Nared is averaging an incredible 23.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 4.3 assists, shooting 53.2 percent from the field, including 46.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“The taller guards have been a thorn in our back,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully, we can keep [Nared] out of rhythm and we’ve been doing a better job of pressing this year, so hopefully we can make them speed it up more than their used to and then we don’t have to guard them in the half court.”</p>\n<p>As an offensively minded team, the Gaels have four players averaging double-figures and have tallied 84.3 points in their first three games.</p>\n<p>“They’re tough. They put up 90 [points] just about every night and probably the one stat to me that I don’t know if I’ve ever seen in my 20 years of coaching is 50 free throw attempts against Butler on the road,” Mitchell said. “That just tells me they have an attack mentality. It’s not going to be a finesse game. It’s going to be attack the paint and attack the boards. We’ll definitely have our hands full.”</p>\n<p>Even as a team that likes to push the ball, UCSB has averaged 63.5 points per game. In the season opener, Santa Barbara put 76 points on the scoreboard, tying the second most in the Carlene Mitchell era.</p>\n<p>“We know what we’re capable of on the defensive end. Defense is going to be the main game plan,” Nesbit said. “I think for us, we’ve been scoring more than the past couple seasons, so we know we’re going to get them to play our game and speed it up and see if they can hang with us.”</p>\n<p>Tip off tonight is set for 6 p.m. at McKeon Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/","id":615,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[614,613,612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Heads to Colorado to Face off Against Pac-12 Foe","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Vandenbelt_11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Vandenbelt_11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-17.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos Play Colorado on the Road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With an impressive road victory already on its resume this season, the UCSB men’s basketball team will have a chance to add another road win today when it faces Colorado in a game that will be aired on the Pac-12 Network.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the game with a 2-1 record, while Colorado, a NCAA Tournament team last year, comes into Thursday’s contest at 4-1 on the season.

Thursday’s contest will be the Buffaloes’ fifth game in a six-game homestand. Colorado has received votes in both major polls and would be ranked No. 34 in the Coaches’ Poll and No. 37 in the AP Poll, respectively.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Spencer Dinwiddie ranks second for Colorado with 12.4 points per game, providing a steady option from the outside where he is shooting .417 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Josh Scott, meanwhile, anchors Colorado on the inside, averaging team highs in points (14.6 per game) and rebounds (eight per game). The 6’10” Scott will certainly provide a formidable post presence against the Gauchos in what could be a marquee matchup should Big Al play Thursday.</p>\n<p>Just over a week ago, Santa Barbara demolished UNLV 86-65 on the road, showing this relatively young team can handle the pressures of the road. The Gauchos’ ability to handle hostile crowds will be significantly tested in Boulder where the Buffaloes have averaged over 8,500 fans in attendance during their first four home games.</p>\n<p>In the absence of Williams, sophomore forward Sam Beeler posted 14 points and five rebounds in a career-high 28 minutes played against Utah State.

As fans, we try to write the scripts of our favorite sports even before any games are played. We always think we know what’s coming — which team will end up in first place and which one is doomed to a season of insignificance — yet we keep watching. We do this because we know that on any given day, an underdog can win a game that they weren’t supposed to. The script is constantly being flipped, and we are reminded that every statistic we see on paper is thrown out the window the second the two teams step onto the playing field. We don’t want to miss out on the teams making those amazing runs, those improbable upsets that no one could have seen coming. This season, the UCSB women’s volleyball team just happens to be one of those teams.</p>\n<p>After the Big West Preseason Coaches Poll predicted the Gauchos to finish in sixth place out of nine in the conference, expectations weren’t exactly sky high. New coaches, new players and a conference dominated by Hawaii, the No. 11 ranked team in the nation — not the ideal formula for a season with championship aspirations. For whatever reason, though, this team of scrappy Gauchos has done the improbable this season. They are currently second in the Big West at 10-2, trailing only the 12-2 Matadors of Cal State Northridge. With just four matches left and a tiebreaker over Northridge, UCSB has its destiny in its own hands; win out, and they’re the champs. But how did this happen?</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons I took the program is because I knew we could have success, challenge for Big West championships and make the NCAA’s,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “However, back in February when I took over, I did not think that we would be challenging [this season], and that’s just a testament and credit to the team.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Twelve games into the year, the Gauchos didn’t look like the team that they knew they could be. They had played well at times, but with a 5-7 preseason record, that sixth place prediction wasn’t looking too far off. Despite the sub-.500 record heading into their first conference match, though, the team knew it was capable of much more.</p>\n<p>“We had a really tough preseason, and there were some games that we should have won,” freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt said. “But I think the preseason showed us what we could do. Taking games off top-teams gave us a lot of confidence, we just kept working super hard in practice and everything sort of came together.”</p>\n<p>In their Big West opener at home against Long Beach State, the Gauchos were seemingly at a disadvantage because of an injury to senior outside hitter and co-captain Leah Sully’s hitting arm the week before. As a result, UCSB stumbled to a disappointing 3-2 loss, but the injury would prove to be a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>“That was the first match we moved Leah to libero and so we had a brand-new lineup and only a day or two to practice with it,” Lantagne Welch said. “We really got into a rhythm after that and were able to really produce. People were really comfortable in their roles and really started to excel from that point on.”</p>\n<p>With Sully now playing libero, other positions began to open up for the younger players on the team. Sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau’s production skyrocketed thanks to the absence of Sully on the outside, and Spindt established herself as a nightly threat for a double-double. The Gauchos also received consistent contributions from freshmen middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg, who have remarkably risen to first and fourth, respectively, in blocks per set in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for any freshman to come into a starting role, there’s a lot of adjustments to be made,” Sully said. “But they did a really great job at taking on their roles and when they play well other people play well, so that helps the team a lot.”</p>\n<p>With the role players in place, Sully continuing to anchor the middle at libero, and senior opposite Katey Thompson performing at a high level as the team’s top hitter, the Gauchos were ready to make a run, and they did just that.</p>\n<p>Following the loss to Long Beach State, UCSB took down UC Irvine in straight sets and a hot Cal Poly team, 3-1. Next up was the most difficult road test of the season: Hawaii. The Rainbow Wahine had risen to No. 3 in the nation at the time and had been undefeated in the Big West since they entered it last season, but the girls from Santa Barbara came in ready for a fight. After five grueling sets, the Gauchos came away with one of their biggest and most exciting wins in the team’s recent history, reminding everyone, including themselves, that anything was possible.</p>\n<p>“I think the team really believed that we could play with anybody,” Lantagne Welch said. “The combination of the older players believing in the new players, and everyone just being ready to go after it was a big point in that victory.”</p>\n<p>From then, things became almost too easy. UCSB defeated the Big West’s top team for the second straight week in Cal State Northridge, 3-0. The next day, it showed its resilience in a comeback victory over a tough UC Davis squad. In the Gauchos’ next three road matches, they failed to drop even one set, sweeping UC Riverside, Cal State Fullerton and Cal Poly as they prepared for the season’s final stretch of matches.</p>\n<p>“One of the best things is we had such balance,” Lantagne Welch said. “One match it would be a Katey Thompson, another match it would be an Ali Spindt, then it was Ali Barbeau and Leah Sully’s passing and defense. There isn’t one particular player, and I think that’s the reflection of our success because there have been so many contributions.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s historic winning-streak of eight straight matches, its longest since 2005, came to a close in a tough loss to Hawaii a couple of weeks ago, but the Gauchos have since bounced back with wins over Davis and first-place Northridge. The Gauchos haven’t made it to the NCAA tournament since 2009, and they haven’t won the conference since 2004, but for whatever reason, this is the year that it might happen.</p>\n<p>With all the unexpected ups and downs a season has to offer, it is difficult to predict how any team’s year will go. Sometimes, like in the case of the 2013 UCSB women’s volleyball team, everything just comes together the right way at the right time. Now, just four more wins is all it will take to complete what has been a storybook season. Four more wins, and these underdog Gauchos are Big West champs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 20, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/","id":3241,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3240,3239,3238],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Carolina Cooking Something Special","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11192013-CamNewton-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11192013-CamNewton-1.jpg?resize=650%2C352&ssl=1","description":"Carolina is the hottest team in the NFL with a six-game winning streak.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s always fun to see the maturation of a player with the tools to become a star finally perform on the field in personal accomplishments, but more importantly in team victories. One such example this season is quarterback Cam Newton and the emergence of the Carolina Panthers as a postseason contender. The Panthers currently own the third-best record in the National Football Conference (NFC) and sit only one game behind the New Orleans Saints in the NFC South. Carolina has won six straight games, the previous two over perennial Super Bowl contenders in the San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots and looks like a team with a legitimate chance to make a postseason run.</p>\n<p>Before delving into why the Panthers have been so successful this season, I will address the controversial victory over the Patriots on Monday Night Football. In the final play of the game, linebacker Luke Kuechly wrapped his arms around Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski as Patriots quarterback Tom Brady’s last-second heave was intercepted by Panthers safety Robert Lester. The back judge threw a flag for pass interference before conferencing with the other officials. The referees then proceeded to pick up the flag, say there was no foul on the play and run off the field. There was no explanation offered to the Patriots and the game simply ended in a controversial non-call.</p>\n<p>First off, the officials should have explained waving off the penalty. Analysts seem split on whether this play warranted a flag, and I’m on the side saying Brady deserved an opportunity to give the Patriots a win with one final play from the one-yard line. Sure, maybe Gronkowski wouldn’t have been able to get back to the ball in time to stop the interception. But the play was too close to call to avoid such a blatantly clear penalty. It’s not as if the ball was 15 feet above Gronkowski’s head or twenty yards short. Gronk was close enough to the play that if he wasn’t held, it is reasonable enough to imagine a player of his magnitude at least tipping the ball in the air and extending the play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I think it should have been a penalty giving the Patriots one final play to win the game, but that was not the sole determiner in the game. The Panthers played extremely well against a talented New England squad and asserted themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the NFL this season with back-to-back quality wins over probable postseason squads.</p>\n<p>Newton has improved his play this season tremendously, and while his passing yardage totals are down from his first two seasons, his accuracy and decision-making skills are way up. Newton ranks ninth in the NFL in quarterback rating at 91.8 and finished Monday’s game 19-28 with 209 yards passing and three touchdowns. Add in an additional 62 yards on the ground and Newton really displayed just how dangerous he can be to opposing defenses.</p>\n<p>The former Heisman winner displays the big-play ability, both with his arm and legs, to make Carolina just dangerous enough to scrape by offensively. Carolina’s key offensively is Newton and the Panthers live or die depending on how Cam performs week to week.</p>\n<p>Carolina’s offense may not be elite, but the Panthers possess some formidable weapons in deep-threat receiver Steve Smith, a tough pass catching tight end in Greg Olsen and a trio of diversely skilled running backs in DeAngelo Williams, Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert. It’s certainly not the best or even one of the top ten offenses in the NFL, but with such a dominant defense, the Panthers don’t need their offense to carry them every game. Newton just has to limit mistakes and make enough big plays to ensure the Panthers put points on the board and keep it out of the other team’s hands.</p>\n<p>Where the Panthers’ true strength lies is in its defense. Carolina is allowing a mere 13.5 points per game through 10 games this season, a mark that if it holds up over the remainder of the season would rank as the lowest point per game total allowed by a defense in the NFL since the 2006 Baltimore Ravens. Pretty impressive for a Panthers squad that started the season 1-3 including losses in which they allowed over 20 points at the hands of Buffalo and Arizona.</p>\n<p>Kuechly and fellow linebacker Thomas Davis are racking up the tackles in the middle of the field, ranking ninth and 13th in the league in tackles, respectively. The duo has combined for a total of 170 tackles. On the defensive line, defensive end Charles Johnson ranks ninth in the NFL with 8.5 sacks this season, while defensive tackles Dwan Edwards and Star Lotulelei have helped the Panthers stuff the run. Carolina ranks third in the league allowing 84.5 rushing yards per game.</p>\n<p>The defensive secondary has been solid all season as well, aided by the frequent pressure the front seven puts on quarterbacks. Carolina ranks fifth in the league in passing yards allowed and is second in forced turnovers with 23 this season. The Panthers rank third in the league in turnover differential, a major component to the team’s success this season.</p>\n<p>With a roster consisting of many young and developing stars, the Panthers’ brightest days are certainly ahead of them. Already possessing a dominant defense and a still growing and versatile franchise quarterback, Carolina is in position to be a NFC South contender over the next several years. NFL teams should be afraid if the Panthers continue to perform as they have during this six-game winning streak, especially if they can continue defeating elite teams like the 49ers and Patriots.</p>\n<p>Carolina’s ceiling this season depends largely on the two remaining games against New Orleans in weeks 14 and 16. If the Panthers can manage to win one of these matchups, or even miraculously pull off a sweep, a NFC South title and possibly even a first-round bye would not be out of the question. Aside from these two games, the Panthers’ remaining schedule is less than daunting with matchups against the inconsistent Dolphins and Jets, and games against the lowly Buccaneers and Falcons. An 11-win campaign, as unlikely as it would have seemed at the beginning of the year, looks like a definite possibility for Carolina this season.</p>\n<p>Flaws remain for the Panthers however, specifically in the running game, where they have had only one 100-yard rusher in a game all season. As a young squad, it is still early to tell whether Carolina can maintain its current pace and make the postseason in a competitive NFC. This is after all a team that lost earlier in the season to a mediocre Buffalo team.</p>\n<p>Again, if Carolina continues its spectacular defensive play and Newton can avoid costly turnovers and make big drive-extending plays when necessary, Carolina could emerge as the surprise team of the season. If the next six weeks of the season are in any way like the previous six for the Panthers, the NFL better watch out for Carolina come the postseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 20, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Irene Kuo of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/","id":3244,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3243,3242,3241],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Matt Gronow: A Genuine Gaucho","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Matt-Gronow-MagaliGauthier_MWaterpolo_100712-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Matt-Gronow-MagaliGauthier_MWaterpolo_100712-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite Becoming a Water Polo Star at UCSB, Gronow Still Remains Personable and Passionate","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Most people know UCSB men’s water polo attacker Matt Gronow as the talented Aussie in the pool.</p>\n<p>With the team’s regular season over and MPSF Championships approaching, the team captain currently leads the Gaucho offense in goals this season with 56.

He has a standard order that consists of an agave latte, a cheese bagel with plain cream cheese and lemon pepper and a bottle of orange juice on occasion. He has a serious love for breakfast food in general, but he lists bagels as his absolute favorite and jokes about a period of time where that was all he ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>\n<p>During the interview, friends passing by bombard him with hellos. Like any UCSB athlete, Gronow is well-known in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>However, unlike many that might just return a simple, “Hello,” Gronow gives his full attention to each individual that approaches him. Not only was he participating in a detailed, one-on-one interview, but he was also making time for and expressing genuine interest in every conversation.</p>\n<p>This caring attitude comes as a result of striving to live out of honor for his dad.</p>\n<p>“When I was younger, it was embarrassing; he would strike up conversations with everyone,” Gronow said. “I didn’t realize it at the time, but now that I think about it, if I could have one trait about me from him, it would be the ability to be personable with everyone.”</p>\n<p>Gronow describes himself as always being a family man, but the recent passing of his dad gave a whole new meaning to the importance of loved ones.</p>\n<p>“With Dad passing away, something clicked in my mind … things can happen,” said Gronow.</p>\n<p>He explained that most people have been surprised by his ability to talk so openly and honestly about the situation, but he credits his amazing support system for this newfound strength.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara, Gronow is constantly surrounded by his teammates, whom he describes as being the best distraction from the situation. When Head Coach Wolf Wigo first broke the news to the team, Gronow remembers his phone lighting up for hours with text messages and calls from all of his teammates and their family members.</p>\n<p>“I will never forget these guys; they are definitely family,” said Gronow. “It sounds weird, but I know their smells … I could tell you a million things about each of them.”</p>\n<p>Back home in Australia, Gronow’s support comes from his immediate family. He describes his older siblings Chris and Ali and his mom as being the biggest influences on the person he is today.</p>\n<p>Gronow grew up in Essendon, Australia, a suburban neighborhood just outside of Melbourne. He spent his younger days shadowing his older brother Chris and constantly seeking advice from his sister Ali. When asked about his mom he says flat out, “My mum is crazy.” After a brief pause, he laughs and admits to being a total momma’s boy.</p>\n<p>When he was younger, he never shared the common childhood ideal of becoming a firefighter or an astronaut, but instead has always dreamed of standing atop a podium, medal in hand, representing his country as an Olympian.</p>\n<p>“Pretty much everything about his game has improved,” Wigo said. “He has put himself in a position where that is definitely a reality in the future if he chooses that path.”</p>\n<p>After an early morning of practice and breakfast at Cajé, Gronow heads across the street to his job at Embarcadero Hall. He works in a small office off the main lecture hall where he assists professors in prepping their power points and setting up their microphones.</p>\n<p>After a short two-hour shift, it’s back to the long-term Olympic grind. Gronow heads to the athletic training center to meet his teammates for an afternoon of weights.</p>\n<p>Walking into the training center, “Get on My Level,” by Wiz Khalifa plays in the background as workout motivation, but that doesn’t last long. Gronow walks into the trainer’s office and changes the music from rap to a playlist that gives off more of a modern, Ellie Goulding vibe. He says he doesn’t like rap music, and describes Jack Johnson as more his style.</p>\n<p>Although all of the players are completing their training circuits individually, their playful conversations and joking mannerisms in between sets make it apparent that they function as a single team unit.</p>\n<p>“He has done a great job as captain keeping the guys motivated and keeping the team together as a group,” Wigo said. “It has been the most consistent year for UCSB in a really long time, and he has contributed to that.”</p>\n<p>Gronow approached his role as team captain and leader through living by example.

The basket increased Nesbit’s point total to 18, which led all Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We knew that we had an advantage getting to the rim,” Nesbit said. “I saw a lane and I took it.”</p>\n<p>Down on the other end, freshman forward LaBrittney Jones received the basketball on the right block. As she went up for the shot, she earned the foul call and hit both free throws to give the Wildcats a two-point advantage.</p>\n<p>Arizona ran the clock down to 6.8 seconds by fouling the Gauchos with remaining fouls to give. On the inbounds, senior guard Melissa Zornig got into the lane, but was quickly trapped. She was able to get a shot off, but the highly-contested shot wouldn’t fall, leading to Santa Barbara’s first loss of the season.</p>\n<p>“I am a competitor and a sore loser, but as a head coach I am extremely proud of the effort,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “The effort was there. There was no doubt about it.”</p>\n<p>While the contest went down to the final buzzer, the game was not ultimately decided in the final minutes, but rather earlier in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos put the Wildcats in the penalty with 8:15 remaining, leading to 15 free throw attempts down the stretch. On the game, Arizona shot 19 free throws compared to just six for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We know the new rule change and we have to make the adjustment. The players have to understand that [the refs] are going to call the hand checks,” Mitchell said. “Arizona was more aggressive attacking the paint. I think at times, we settled for too many jumpers. In our first two games, I think we shot 19 and 21 free throws, so that’s definitely the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Also critical in the loss was the rebounding margin. Santa Barbara was outrebounded 40-32, including 24-14 in the second half. Twice when the Wildcats headed to the charity stripe, the Gauchos didn’t box out, giving Arizona extra scoring opportunities and erasing the seven point lead UCSB had earned to begin the second half.</p>\n<p>“We probably went a little smaller in the second half. When that happens, we should know we can’t out jump them,” Mitchell said. “You have to make an effort to block out. I think we started trying to tip the ball to ourselves. You can’t do that against stronger athletes.”</p>\n<p>The loss drops Santa Barbara to 1-1 on the season while Arizona earned its first win of the season, improving to 1-2.</p>\n<p>“There are so many things that we could control that would have led to a different outcome,” Mitchell said. “We have to hold ourselves accountable. Give Arizona all the credit in the world. They found a way to win on our court after two overtime losses, but if we could go back and exchange about three or four possessions, that final score would’ve been a little different.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Wildcats on the offensive end was redshirt junior guard Candice Warthen, who totaled 18 points and three assists on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB held Warthen below her season average of 21.5 points and 6.5 assists. Taking the defensive assignment on Warthen was freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe, who, in her first start as a Gaucho, totaled seven points, three assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>“[Jemerigbe] brings so much,” Nesbit said. “Her defensive intensity when she comes in, we seem to step it up to another level. We get excited because she’s picking people up 94 feet [from the basket] and she’s pressuring and you can tell their offensive players do not like it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to receive consistent production from their seniors. Along with Nesbit, Zornig tallied eight points, six rebounds and a team-high five assists. Senior guard Destini Mason also added 10 points.</p>\n<p>Next week, UCSB will take its first road trip of the season, traveling north to play St. Mary’s on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/","id":612,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[611,610,609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Matadors in Big West Semifinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soccer.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soccer.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB finds out its fate Monday morning for the NCAA Tournament selection show.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It is always disappointing when an undefeated streak comes to an end, but that was certainly the case Friday night when the No. 8 UCSB men’s soccer team fell to No. 22 Cal State Northridge 3-2 in a dramatic Big West Semifinals match.

It’s like watching a train wreck and you can’t stop it,” Vom Steeg said of the red cards and Northridge’s comeback.</p>\n<p>The top 16 teams in the tournament are given a first-round bye and host a second round match, meaning UCSB would receive more time off in an effort to rest injured players including senior forward Achille Campion and senior defender Peter Schmetz, both All Conference First Team Selections.</p>\n<p>“What’s critical is to not have to play on Thursday,” Vom Steeg said. “And that gives us until next Sunday to see about Campion and to see about Schmetz.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finds out its destiny Monday and is expected to play either Thursday or Sunday in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53069\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53069\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/","id":1569,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1568,1567,1566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 6 UCSB Falls to First Place UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/water-polo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/water-polo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB ends its regular season on a three-game losing skid.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team fell to No. 3 UCLA with a final score of 10-7 in its last conference game of the season this weekend.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara maintains its No. 6 ranking with an overall record of 16-9, and a conference record of 3-5, and the Bruins advance to first-place with an overall mark of 26-2 and a conference record of 6-1.

One goal from sophomore attacker Kevin Cappon and two from senior attacker Matt Gronow put the Gauchos ahead 3-2. Shortly after, UCLA drew an exclusion penalty against UCSB and one of the leading Bruins offensive players in junior attacker Paul Reynolds tied the game at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The second period began with three consecutive offensive possessions for the Gauchos, but it was UCLA that was able to put the first goal on the board. This scoring momentum continued and UCLA opened the second period with three goals, holding UCSB scoreless. With one minute left in the period, sophomore two-meter Nicholas Jordan broke the dry spell for the Gauchos, bringing the score to 6-4.</p>\n<p>Another quick attack from the Bruins opened the third quarter, giving them a dramatic four-goal lead with a score of 8-4.

Senior utility Bryce Miller and junior attacker Eric Van De Mortel each scored, bringing the count to 9-7.</p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, it appeared that the Gauchos were gaining confidence with each possession. They were pressuring on the counter attack, and forcing UCLA to make mistakes. As a result, UCSB was given a power play opportunity, but UCLA’s freshman goalkeeper Garrett Danner denied the goal. With 3:30 left in the game, Reynolds delivered a lob shot over Whitelegge’s head and secured the Bruins’ victory with a final score of 10-7.</p>\n<p>“It was good. We made some mistakes and we paid for that, but overall we did pretty well,” Whitelegge said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end their season on a three-game losing streak, but have plenty of positives to move forward from.</p>\n<p>“Our effort level and heart were definitely here, we just need to focus on playing 30 full seconds of defense,” Whitelegge said. “We will be able to take care of that, it’s looking good for the MPSF conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to Stockton for the MPSF tournament in two weeks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53065\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/no-6-ucsb-falls-to-first-place-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53065\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/no-6-ucsb-falls-to-first-place-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/no-6-ucsb-falls-to-first-place-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/no-6-ucsb-falls-to-first-place-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/no-6-ucsb-falls-to-first-place-ucla/","id":5117,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5116,5115,5114],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Compete at NCAA Regionals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Cross Country","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Several UCSB runners competed at the NCAA Regionals this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a very long season for both squads, the UCSB men’s and women’s cross country teams wrapped up the competitive year this past Friday at the NCAA Regional Meet.

The last two Gauchos to score in this race were 128th-placed sophomore Sarah Shreck, with a time of 21:45, and freshman Emily Lopes, who came in 136th place at 21:53.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in a print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53073\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-compete-at-ncaa-regionals-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53073\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-compete-at-ncaa-regionals-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-compete-at-ncaa-regionals-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-compete-at-ncaa-regionals-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-compete-at-ncaa-regionals-2/","id":1771,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1770,1769,1768],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Beat CSUN, Now Sit in First Place in the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB swept the season series against Northridge.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last Saturday, the UCSB women’s volleyball team played what was then its biggest match of the season against No. 12 Hawaii, coming up just short in a 3-2 loss. Exactly seven days later, the Gauchos took on first-place Cal State Northridge in a match with even bigger implications in deciding the Big West championship race. UCSB did something that it couldn’t do against Hawaii, prevailing with a thrilling 3-2 win and putting itself in the best position of any team to win the conference.</p>\n<p>The latest win gives UCSB a record of 15-9 overall and 10-2 in the Big West while dropping Northridge to 22-5 and 12-2. After completing the season sweep over the Matadors, the Gauchos earned the all important tie-breaker, which will give them first place if the two teams end the year with the same record. On Thursday, a 3-0 UCSB victory over UC Davis dropped the Aggies to 14-12 overall and 6-7 in conference.</p>\n<p>“It felt awesome. Winning any five-set game is really a great feeling,” freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt said. “We were just hungry to win and we knew we had to pull it out.

UCSB pulled away with five straight points, taking a 20-13 lead thanks to the serving of senior opposite Katey Thompson.</p>\n<p>“We had confidence knowing we could beat them because we’ve been there before,” Spindt said. “We never underestimate any team so we just came out how we did the first time we played them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on to win the set 25-18, but the Matadors responded well in the second, winning it 29-27.</p>\n<p>After splitting the next two sets, with UCSB winning the third 25-20 and Northridge taking the fourth 25-21, the fifth set began promisingly for the Gauchos. With the score at 14-12, the final point provided a fitting end to the match as Thompson took a pass from senior libero Leah Sully and finished it off for her 15th kill of the night.</p>\n<p>“We stayed mentally tough and we had a lot of energy and fight,” Spindt said. “We grinded it out for every single point and we knew it was going to be a battle. We just kept pushing.”</p>\n<p>Spindt led UCSB adding 18 kills and 10 digs, while freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt added six block assists.</p>\n<p>UC Davis came into Thursday’s match wanting revenge after they relinquished a 2-1 lead in a loss to the Gauchos last month. However, UCSB made quick work of the Aggies this time around, following Spindt’s 14 kills and 17 digs to an easy 3-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Grunt was again a big factor, picking up eight kills on a .467 hitting percentage, while Sully led the defense with 22 digs.</p>\n<p>“We really focused on our serving in practice which helped us a lot in both our games this weekend,” Spindt said. “We were just really focused and we knew these two games were really important.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face Fullerton Friday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/","id":5285,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5284,5283,5282],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Utah State Defeats Shorthanded Gauchos","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/basketball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/basketball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB lost for the first time this season on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team suffered its first loss of the season Saturday in a 71-64 loss to Utah State at the Thunderdome.

Coming off an impressive victory at UNLV, the confident Gauchos were dealt a serious blow without Williams to go along with the absence of sophomore guard John Green due to injury.</p>\n<p>Down by as much as 14 in the first half, UCSB struggled to shut down the shooters of Utah State for a majority of the game. The Aggies entered halftime with a 39-29 advantage thanks in large part to a pair of senior guards in Spencer Butterfield (16 points and seven rebounds) and Preston Medlin (18 points).</p>\n<p>“I thought the first half they were just nervous without Al and they tried to do too much and they were jittery,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In the second half our quickness got them going. We went small and the quickness affected the game. We got some strips, we got out and ran, so it took them a while to adjust to our quickness.”</p>\n<p>Halftime adjustments led to an 11-0 UCSB run to open the second half as the Gauchos took a 40-39 lead. Both teams battled from then on with the Aggies holding a three-point lead with 30 seconds remaining in the game. Utah State made free throws down the stretch however to close the game and secure a victory.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we got out way more in transition than we have in the past. I think we’re a very good transition team,” sophomore forward Sam Beeler said. “The more we can get stops and do all that stuff and get out and run, the more chance we have to make open shots.”</p>\n<p>Bryson led UCSB with 15 points on the night, while Beeler registered 14 points and five rebounds in replacement of Big Al. Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 11 points but was unable to find many open looks from the three because of the absence of Big Al.</p>\n<p>“With Sam and Al in there they definitely have to help down. Al goes down there and he kills. Sam goes in there … and he is bigger and taller and able to go over the top and make shots,” Bryson said. “That presence wasn’t there offensively so we definitely had to try something different this game. We came back but it just wasn’t enough this time.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was one area of strength for Santa Barbara Saturday as freshman Eric Childress and junior Zalmico Harmon combined for nine assists and only one turnover. Childress finished the game with seven points, five assists, four rebounds and two stills.

Arizona on the other hand, is still looking for its first victory of the year at 0-2.</p>\n<p>“They’ve lost their first two games in overtime, so they’re right there,” Mitchell said. “They’re extremely athletic. They’ll be bigger, stronger, quicker, but hopefully we continue to improve and do what we do well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters Saturday’s match-up with momentum after a 76-54 blowout over Occidental in the season opener. With 76 points, the team scored the second-most in the Carlene Mitchell era. Utilizing a fast-paced transition offense which led to 50.8 percent shooting from the field, UCSB went on a 39-10 run to end the first half and begin the second half, taking a 28 point lead that would be too large for Occidental to overcome.</p>\n<p>“We know as a team that we can score and that we’re good in transition,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We’re small this year, so we have to push the ball and get points off of transition.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Arizona started its season with two close overtime losses to Iona and Michigan. In those two games, the Wildcats were outrebounded by an average of 10 boards, something UCSB would like to take advantage of to jump start its offense.</p>\n<p>“If we outrebound them and limit turnovers, we’ll be good,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware said. “If we get rebounds, we can push the ball and our best offense is when we push the ball.”</p>\n<p>Although Arizona returns four starters from last year’s squad, the team is extremely young with seven of the 12 members listed as underclassmen. Also as a team that isn’t extremely tall, it should be a good match-up for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“They like to push it and everything’s going to and through their guards, so they’re very similar to us,” Mitchell said. “We’ll look to take a lot of switches because their tallest player that’s gotten any minutes is 6’1’’.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Wildcats offensively is redshirt junior guard Candice Warthen, who missed last season with a knee injury. At just 5’5’’, Warthen is averaging 21.5 points, 6.5 assists and three steals per game.</p>\n<p>Other offensive threats include senior guard Kama Griffitts , who as a taller guard averages 15.0 points per game, and freshman forward Dejza James. In her first two games, James scored 11.5 points and five rebounds on 10-15 shooting.</p>\n<p>“The biggest key for us will be defense, like every game,” Zornig said. “Just because it’s Arizona, we’re not looking at them any different than Occidental. We don’t look at the name on the jersey. We just want to go out there and play.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. Saturday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/","id":611,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[610,609,608],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Try to Stay Perfect","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1172.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1172.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Men's basketball hosts Utah State Saturday","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fresh off an impressive 86-65 thrashing of UNLV on the road Tuesday night, the UCSB men’s basketball team will face another difficult test, this time in the form of visiting Utah State on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the game with a 2-0 record, while the Aggies come into their first road game of the season with a similar 2-0 mark on the year.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a great test for us. We have about six potential top-25 and tournament teams this year [on our schedule] and Utah State is definitely one of them,” sophomore forward Taran Brown said. “Coming off that big win, we’re going to have a lot of energy and be fired up and ready to go. I think we’ve just got to play the same way we did and it’s going to come out good for us.”</p>\n<p>Both of UCSB’s victories this season have come by more than 20-point margins as the Gauchos defeated Hawaii Pacific 76-50 in the first game of the year.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s win featured a dominant offensive attack that featured a number of players sharing the wealth. Junior center Alan Williams led UCSB with 21 points and nine rebounds, while senior guard Kyle Boswell scored 19 points after finishing 5-7 from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a great victory, especially to get a win on the road. For a lot of the new guys, it was obviously their first test on the road,” Boswell said. “We came together as a team and we moved the ball in such an unselfish manner that everybody was able to get involved pretty early in the game.”</p>\n<p>Williams leads UCSB this season averaging 24 points and 13 rebounds per game, marks that both rank first in the Big West. Boswell, meanwhile, has served as a strong second option averaging 14.5 points per game and is shooting just over 57 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Aiding the duo for the Gauchos is a pair of sophomores in guard Michael Bryson and Taran Brown. Bryson ranks third on the team with 11 points per game. Brown has averaged eight points per game and is second on the squad with seven boards per contest.</p>\n<p>“Teams are scouting us and they know they have to double-team Al. If that’s the case, that’s one kick out … and we have open shots like nothing,” Brown said. “Once that double team is down there, the defense is out of position. Me, Michael and Bos, we’ve got to be ready to get good shots up because once that double team comes, one of us will be open.”</p>\n<p>Guiding the Gauchos from the point is a pair of newcomers to the team in junior Zalmico Harmon and freshman Eric Childress. Harmon has nine assists, averaging 5.5 per game, but has yet to commit a turnover on the season. Childress meanwhile showed flashes of brilliance on Tuesday finishing with nine points and six assists.</p>\n<p>One area of concern for UCSB, however, is the loss of sophomore guard John Green to a foot injury. Expected to be out anywhere from three to six weeks, Green scored eight points in the team’s first game this season before sitting out the UNLV game with injury. His versatility with the ability to shoot from the perimeter and back down smaller guards in the post will be missed by UCSB over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“The absence of John Green means we have to come together more as a team,” Boswell said. “We have so many weapons already on our squad that the key for us is moving the ball and getting everyone involved, which makes it hard for the other team to guard. Everyone on our team has to be ready to fill that role.”</p>\n<p>Utah State, meanwhile, has proven dangerous this season, defeating Pac-12 opponent USC 78-65 before demolishing Southern Utah by a score of 90-57. Senior center Jared Shaw leads the Aggies averaging 18 points and seven rebounds per game, and he will provide a formidable opponent for Big Al in the post.</p>\n<p>With expectations high for Santa Barbara this season, the Gauchos have looked like a strong unit, albeit in a small sample size. Saturday will be another litmus test as to just how good UCSB is this early in the season.</p>\n<p>“We’re coming together as a team really well. We have so much talent on this team that at any given point anyone can kind of take over the game,” Boswell said. “We’re looking for our mistakes and making corrections pretty quickly, which is what you want to be for a mature team to grow up and be able to make a deep run in the tournament later in the season.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday against Utah State is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52947\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52947\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/","id":609,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[608,607,606],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":140,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
