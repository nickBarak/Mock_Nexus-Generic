In her first start of the season, Roper recorded her second-worst field goal percentage in a game at 10 percent. She ended the game 1-10 shooting, 1-6 from behind the perimeter and made just one of four free throw attempts.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think she was shot-ready today,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “A good shooter has to have a short-term memory. The shooters have to be ready, and she [Roper] was standing straight up, not ready.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB’s loss in its return home makes the Gauchos 1-7 overall and increased their losing streak to five consecutive games. After beginning its season 0-2, Santa Clara is now 5-2 after earning its fifth-straight victory.</p>\n<p>Despite its shots not falling, Santa Barbara did manage to stay in the game in the first quarter, making 2-5 three-point attempts. Scoring one of the team’s field goals was freshman forward Kali Jones with a layup. Yet she would be sent to the bench due to picking up two early fouls and did not play for the rest of the first half.</p>\n<p>A UCSB turnover in the last 20 seconds of the first quarter resulted in a buzzer layup by sophomore guard Taylor Berry to give the Broncos an 11-9 lead to close the quarter. They capitalized on the quick lead, turning the score into a 6-0 run to open the second quarter.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 5:50 mark that UCSB earned its first field goal of the quarter from a layup by sophomore forward Chaya Durr. Limiting UCSB’s attempt to feed the paint was the Broncos’ 2-3 zone. For the first time this season, the Gauchos were outscored in the paint 14-28.</p>\n<p>Leading the Broncos’ frontcourt was sophomore forward Morgan McGwire as she led Santa Clara with 13 points on 6-10 shooting and grabbed a game-high nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara also used a 2-2-1 full court press throughout the game in combination with its zone. UCSB was unable to overcome the pressures of the defensive traps and double teams of Santa Clara’s on-ball defense, turning the ball over 17 times in the first half and ending with a total of 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It [2-2-1 zone] was aggressive, it came to a double right away,” Henrickson said. “We have to have cutters coming to the ball. Everybody has to be more aggressive, not just the ballhander.”</p>\n<p>Santa Clara turned the ball over a total of 29 times, but the Gauchos were unable to benefit from the Broncos’ mistakes, scoring just 13 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>“You have to score,” Henrickson said. “We missed opportunities at the rim. You have to be able to knock down free throws, the free throw line has been an issue for us all year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended its night with a 33.3 free throw percentage, making 5-15 attempts.<br>\nDespite their turnovers, the Broncos managed to increase their lead to a margin of eight at 19-11 with nearly two minutes remaining in the first half. However, a strong first half performance by freshman shooting guard Coco Miller kept the Gauchos’ deficit from getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>After two quarters, Miller was 3-4 shooting the ball in which all of her field goal makes and attempts were from long range. Her two three-pointers as the second quarter ended helped trim the Broncos’ lead to 17-21 at halftime. Adding to Miller’s nine points was a free throw make to give her a game-high 10 points in the first half. She finished the game with a game-high 19 points, finishing 5-10 from three-point distance.</p>\n<p>Before recording her third personal foul with 2:54 on the clock in the third quarter, Jones’ return uplifted UCSB’s presence in the paint. Santa Barbara scored eight of its 11 points down low but could not stop the Broncos’ response as they maintained a 27-23 lead.</p>\n<p>Pulling the Gauchos within a one-point deficit was Miller’s basket beyond the arc, cutting Santa Clara’s lead to 26-27. The Broncos entered the fourth quarter with a 30-28 lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara trailed in the beginning of the first quarter, but never lost its advantage once it took a 5-3 lead in Tuesday’s contest. A 13-3 scoring run gave the Broncos their largest lead of 12 at 43-31 with 3:45 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s last six points was Miller with a three-pointer and three makes at the free throw line. Still, her lone performance was not enough to surpass the Broncos’ defense, which held the Gauchos scoreless for the last two minutes of regulation to earn the 48-37 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB was outrebounded 31-45 on Tuesday night, leading to its being outscored in second chance points 7-24.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain in Santa Barbara for another home game versus Loyola Marymount this Friday, Dec. 4 at 7:00 p.m. The Lions are 2-5 overall and are winless on the road with a 0-3 record in away games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of December 3, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/","id":372,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[371,370,369],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ball Is Life?

For people like me, Kobe <em>was</em> life.</p>\n<p>My first memory as a toddler was my mother teaching me to say “please” when asking for my bottle. After that, all I remember is the number eight, the coolest afro I’ve ever seen and Chick Hearn’s magnificent voice saying “Slaaaam dunk!”</p>\n<p>The first videogame I ever remember playing was “Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside” for the Nintendo 64. I can still see the first tip-off I ever took part in with the computer’s David Robinson rising high over my Shaquille O’Neal because I didn’t know the buttons yet at the age of four.</p>\n<p>The first Christmas present I ever remember getting was a mini basketball hoop which I played on all day, every day, annoying the crap out of my sisters while I pretended I was Kobe and practiced his moves.</p>\n<p>When I started Kindergarten, my dad told me he would take me to the front row of a Laker game if I learned how to read. It took me about three weeks. What more motivation did I need?</p>\n<p>For the game, I made a poster that said, “Kobe, 360 for me.” He did. And he winked at me after.</p>\n<p>Over the years, my range of emotions became one with the rises and falls of Kobe and the Lakers. Life had its own stresses and challenges, but I only ever experienced true heartbreak or happiness when I was watching him play.</p>\n<p>It meant everything to me. His success was my success, his embarrassments were my embarrassments.</p>\n<p>I’m not one to cry very often, but when Kobe hit those two shots against Phoenix in Game Four of the first round in 2006, I ran around the house screaming as an ocean of tears fell from my eyes.</p>\n<p>How many of us have had to read the YouTube comments on Kobe’s top career plays only to see people asking, “Why is this number one? It was in the first round and they lost the series.” If you ever had to ask that, then you’ll never know.</p>\n<p>When the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals, giving Kobe his first ring without Shaq, I smiled, teary-eyed, as I reflected upon the long, stressful road to that moment. I remembered where I was during every second of his career: what I was up to in school, who my friends were at the time, the sheer happiness I felt from seeing him hit shot after shot to bring his team back over and over again. It’s all one and the same.</p>\n<p>If there is a reason why I’m able to remember so much about my life growing up, it’s because Kobe made just about every day something worth remembering.</p>\n<p>If there is a reason why I’m writing this article today, it’s because he showed me that loving sports is more than just a hobby. For those with true passion, it is a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>He taught me how to hope, how to care, how to want something and how to go get it no matter who’s standing in the way. He taught me how to be an asshole on the court, he taught me to be a ballhog and he taught me how to win. He set the bar so high that even when I excelled in anything, I felt I needed to do better.</p>\n<p>Numbers never meant a damn thing to Kobe. He never wanted to play by anyone’s rules other than his own, and, thank God, he never did. All he ever wanted was to win, and for a good while, he was the best at it.</p>\n<p>People can bring up all the shooting percentages, stats and figures they want, but the fact is, when Kobe was on the court, that was what made the Lakers, well … the Lakers. He embodied everything that was great about the greatest organization in basketball.</p>\n<p>Ever since he tore his Achilles back in 2013, I’ve felt like I’ve been missing something. It might sound stupid, but life no longer makes sense the way it used to. We’ve been fearing the end of his career for so long, but now that it’s finally here, I’m still not sure how I can possibly accept it. Rooting for him is all I’ve ever known.</p>\n<p>Yeah, it hurts to see him play the way he’s playing right now. It hurts to hear him admitting defeat after games. I don’t enjoy watching him shoot 1-14 one night, listen to him talk about how bad he played and how much pain he’s in, then see him go 4-20 a few nights later.</p>\n<p>But if there’s one thing I’ve loved about Kobe all these years, it’s that no matter what anyone says or thinks, he will always be Kobe. “He shoots too much.” “He needs to learn how to pass.” “He’s not a good leader.” We heard it back in 1999 before the Lakers won three straight championships, we heard it back in 2006 when his starting lineup included Kwame Brown and Smush Parker and we heard it in 2010 when he was still winning championships.</p>\n<p>So who cares if people are still saying it today?</p>\n<p>Most of the athletes who have reached out to honor Kobe since his announcement have all sent messages revolving around the same theme: how much he has inspired them. His work ethic is legendary, his ability to get the job done against all odds is legendary. His fire, ferocity and killer nature will go down in history as possibly the greatest ever.</p>\n<p>The media can say what it wants, but the league’s current stars are the ones who grew up watching him play. They’re the ones who battled and lost to him time and time again, hoping to someday surpass his shadow. And they’re the ones who have spoken up to give him the admiration he deserves.</p>\n<p>Kobe is the last link between what the NBA was and what it is now. He is the bridge between the Michael Jordan era, basketball of the 90s and the end of Showtime, to whatever the hell we see out there today with free-throws, weak fouls and three-pointers filling up the box scores.</p>\n<p>He is the last of a dying breed that will be extinct by the end of this season. He is tradition.</p>\n<p>If he doesn’t make a shot the rest of his life, let’s just enjoy watching him while we can. Few people in the basketball world have had the kind of impact that a man like Kobe Bryant has. Few teams have been spoiled the way Laker fans have been all these years.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant has been both the NBA’s greatest enemy and greatest hero. Now, love him or hate him, let’s send him off the right way.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66851\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66851\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/","id":1994,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1993,1992,1991],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take On USC in 2015 Home Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB got its offense going last week, but can the Gauchos keep it up hosting a Trojan team off to a hot 5-2 start?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Playing in just its second home game of the season, the UCSB men’s basketball team welcomes the USC Trojans to the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66880\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1912400557\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66849\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66880\" data-attachment-id=\"66880\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/maxwell-kupchak-reaches-for-a-rebound-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Maxwell Kupchak reaches for a rebound.

The Trojans have since dropped their last two games on the road to No. 12 Xavier and Monmouth and come to Santa Barbara at 5-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Inconsistent shooting had been the story for the Gauchos to start the season, but they appeared to find some answers on the offensive end in their last two outings, particularly from their starting guards in junior Eric Childress and sophomore Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>Against Arizona St. on Sunday, Childress put up an all-around stat line characteristic of his ability to do all the little things, recording nine points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals. Vincent, who had been particularly struggling with his shot through the first three games of the year, went 12-25 from the field and 6-13 from deep over the past two games. He is averaging 10.8 points and 1.4 steals per game, good for third and second best on the team, respectively.</p>\n<p>Two players who have most certainly not hurt UCSB’s shooting percentage are seniors Michael Bryson and Sam Beeler. Since missing the first game of the season due to suspension, Bryson has stepped easily into his role as the team’s best offensive player, shooting a team-best 37.5 percent from three and 48.2 percent from the field. His 18.8 points per game average ranks second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Beeler, who has started all five games at center, has shot an extremely efficient 76 percent from the field, finding most of his shots deep in the paint for an average of 7.6 points a night.</p>\n<p>The Trojans’ 5-0 start to this season was their best start since going 8-0 in 2000-01. They are led on the offensive side by former Etiwanda High School standout guard Jordan McLaughlin. The sophomore, who was voted one of the team’s two captains for the 2015-16 season, was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team last season with averages of 12.1 points, three rebounds and 4.5 assists. He has been especially hot to open this season, leading the team with 15.3 points per contest and shooting 55.2 percent overall and 51.9 percent on threes.</p>\n<p>Backing him up are junior guard Julian Jacobs and freshman forward Bennie Boatwright, who come in averaging 12.4 points each. In just his freshman year, Boatwright has impressed with an ability to score from inside and out, tying McLaughlin for the team lead in three-pointers made with two per game.</p>\n<p>Jacobs has shown that he can do much more than just score, sitting at second on the team with averages of 6.3 rebounds and 1.28 steals and leading the way with 5.5 assists.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will be the Gauchos’ last home game of 2015 before playing their next six on the road. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of December 3, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/","id":342,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[341,340,339],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Strike First, But No. 2 Clemson Pulls Off Late Sweet Sixteen Winner","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The No. 15 seed UCSB men's soccer team's NCAA Tournament run fell just short in the Sweet Sixteen at No. 2 Clemson.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66833\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"763315608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66839\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66833\" data-attachment-id=\"66833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/nick-depuy-attempts-to-header-the-ball-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Nick DePuy attempts to header the ball.

After conceding two second half goals though, the Gauchos were knocked out of the NCAA Tournament by a final of 3-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ends another successful season for the program with a 14-7-2 overall, 7-2-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The Tigers move on to the NCAA Quarterfinals for the first time in 10 years, improving to a mark of 17-2-2 on the season. They will host a No. 10 Maryland team coming off a 2-1 upset over No. 7 Notre Dame yesterday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In a game which saw UCSB in control for much of the first half, it was the Gauchos who got on the board first. A deep cross sent in by freshman forward Cody Gibson was headed back towards the middle of the box by junior midfielder Josue Espana in the 39<sup>th</sup> minute. First to the ball was junior midfielder Seo-In Kim, who headed it home for his second goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Much to the dismay of UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, it didn’t take long for Clemson to answer back. Just minutes later, Tiger junior defender Aaron Jones came out of the midfield to beat several Gaucho defenders before blasting in a shot from 25 yards out to beat freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, giving him the first goal of his career. The crucial equalizer came with just 57 seconds left in the half, sending the teams into the break tied 1-1.</p>\n<p>The younger Vom Steeg, who was making his NCAA Tournament debut after missing last week’s matchup with South Carolina, was put under much pressure in the second half as the Gauchos were outshot 7-4.</p>\n<p>Playing with more possession and control in the second stanza, the Tigers took their first lead of the game in the 69<sup>th</sup> minute off sophomore forward Diego Campos’s fourth goal of the year. Dribbling along the edge of the 18-yard box, Campos fired a shot in towards the top left corner of the net, giving Clemson its second long-range score of the game.</p>\n<p>As has been the case multiple times this season, it didn’t take long for UCSB to respond to its second half concession. Just 49 seconds after going down, sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht intercepted a back pass intended for the Clemson keeper to score his sixth goal of the year and tie it at 2-2. Feucht’s six goals this season were good for second-best on the team in just his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>With the game anyone’s to win, it was Clemson redshirt senior Kyle Murphy who ended up scoring the decisive goal to break the deadlock in the 79<sup>th</sup> minute. A string of four straight first-time passes, the last of which came from sophomore midfielder Saul Chinchilla on a perfect cross in from the right wing, resulted in a tap in goal by Murphy from eight yards out to give him eight on the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB matched Clemson with 12 shots on the night, but the Tigers put an efficient seven shots on target, resulting in four saves by Vom Steeg.

They combined for 46 points on 18-35 shooting and made 9-15 attempts at the free throw line. Green led the team with 24 points and was 5-5 at the line while Ogwumike scored 22 points and was 4-10 shooting free throws.</p>\n<p>Compared to Pepperdine’s field goal percentage of 35 percent and its three-point percentage of 20 percent, UCSB had a stronger performance shooting, 41.4 percent from the field and meagerly were better from three with a 28.6 percentage.</p>\n<p>However, the Waves’ 71.1 free throw percentage was better than Santa Barbara’s 55.6 percentage and proved to be the deciding factor in Sunday’s game.</p>\n<p>Leading the Waves’ 11-2 run to begin the game was Ogwumike with seven points. Despite allowing the scoring run, a make from beyond the arc by Roper sparked UCSB’s 11-0 run to take a 13-11 lead, forced a Pepperdine timeout and eventually ended with a 15-15 tie to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ 28-27 lead with 2:35 left in the second quarter would be their last of the game. But jumpshots by Jones and sophomore forward Chaya Durr resulted in UCSB trailing 32-33 at the end of the first half. Durr registered a game-high 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s 10-point, 48-38 lead was its largest of the game at the 3:21 mark of the third quarter.  Contributing to the lead was the duo of Green and Ogwumike, scoring 17 points. The Waves’ lead lasted until the 1:43 mark of the quarter but was trimmed to 48-54 by UCSB’s 6-1 run to end the third.</p>\n<p>Two layups by Jones for UCSB, a layup by Ogwumike and a free throw for Pepperdine were scored to start the fourth quarter prior to neither team scoring for nearly the next two minutes.</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Pepperdine found itself in foul trouble as well, committing a total of 28 fouls. But, ending the game’s scoreless streak was Roper, making a pair of free throws. Her ability to make free throws was most crucial in the fourth quarter as she made 10-11 and scored 14 points in the quarter.</p>\n<p>A missed layup by Pepperdine freshman guard Kayla Blair led to senior Dioseline Lopez scoring a layup to bring the Gauchos within two at 69-71. This prompted Santa Barbara’s plan to intentionally foul which landed Ogwumike at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Ogwumike missed both free throw attempts while Jones grabbed the rebound for UCSB and led to the Gauchos calling a timeout with five seconds remaining in regulation. With little time remaining, Lopez attempted a game-winning three-pointer but came up short as UCSB loss 69-71.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has struggled to consistently knock down free throws in each game so far this season. Its 53.3 free throw percentage on Friday certainly was an influence in its loss.</p>\n<p>Season-highs in scoring, field goal and three-point percentage still weren’t enough in UCSB’s contest against Wyoming on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 50 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from behind the three-point line to score 67 points, but a series of scoring runs in the second half and their ability to make free throws helped the Cowgirls defeat UCSB 76-67. Wyoming made 27-35 free throws for a 77.1 percentage.</p>\n<p>It was a career night for freshman shooting guard Coco Miller, recording career-highs with 24 points, four steals, and two blocks.</p>\n<p>A total of four Wyoming players scored 12 or more points on Friday. The Cowgirls established their offensive dominance early, opening the first quarter with a 10-2 run. Wyoming outscored UCSB 19-8 to finish the quarter. Combining for 12 of the team’s points were senior guard Marquelle Dent and freshman forward Marta Gomez. They ended the first with six points apiece as Dent shot 3-3 and Gomez went 2-3 from long distance.</p>\n<p>Dent led Wyoming in points with 17 and had a game-high six assists while Gomez was just one-point behind her lead with 16.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara a just three fouls in the first quarter but would commit many more through the second quarter and beyond, allowing Wyoming to build upon its lead at the free throw line. Wyoming’ largest lead of 15 points appeared in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB responded with a 9-0 run of its own to trim the Cowgirls’ lead to 21-27. Scoring Santa Barbara’s last five points to close the quarter was Miller as the Gauchos trailed 28-34 to head into halftime. Her performance in the second quarter was most pivotal as she scored 10 of her 24 points.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to bring Wyoming’s lead within a single figure deficit, the emergence of senior guard Jordan Kelley to start the second half increased the Cowgirls’ lead back to double digits. She scored Wyoming’s first seven points to begin the third quarter to extend their lead to 41-31. Kelley concluded the game with 13 points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Helping UCSB to counter Wyoming’s scoring was its bench, outscoring the Cowgirls 26-9. Providing a career-high 11 points off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris to go along with a team-high five rebounds.</p>\n<p>An 8-0 run to close out the third quarter helped UCSB reduce Wyoming’s lead as a three-point basket by Miller brought Santa Barbara within four at 51-55. But the Gauchos found themselves down by double-figures at the start of the fourth quarter as Wyoming went on a 7-0 run to take a 62-51 lead with 8:17 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB’s 11 steals was its second-highest this season, Wyoming‘s 14 free throw attempts in the fourth quarter was its most throughout the entirety of the game and ultimately led the Cowgirls to their 76-67 win over UCSB.

The Tigers are coming off a convincing 5-2 victory over Elon, the most goals they’ve scored in the tournament in 17 years. They enter with one of the nation’s best records at 16-2-2 overall, 6-1-1 ACC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will be tested on Sunday. I’m excited for this group to show up down in Clemson,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “In my opinion, [Clemson has] been consistently one of the top four teams in the country all year. The ACC is the best conference and that team is the best team in the ACC.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to the Gauchos, despite being the best team in their respective conference, the Tigers were unable to come away as conference champs, falling 2-0 to No. 3 Syracuse in the ACC Semifinals. The loss was just Clemson’s second of the season and ended a run of nine straight wins and 13 straight undefeated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has saved its best soccer for the most important part of the year, particularly on the defensive end. The Gauchos have gone undefeated in six out of their last seven games. Their only loss during that stretch came to Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Championship, in a game many, including Vom Steeg, have called their best performance of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully we’ll show a lot of the same things we showed in the five game streak we had to close out the season and a bit of what we saw against Fullerton. I thought that was one of our best games of the year offensively and defensively,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “It’s just a matter of putting the ball in the back of the net. Hopefully we find our scoring touch again. We can be a very exciting and dangerous team in the tournament.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last four games, Santa Barbara seems to have solved the defensive issues which plagued it at times during the season. The Gauchos have found success since moving around a pair of All-Big West First Teamers in Backus from right back to the defensive midfield and sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht up into a more attacking role. Junior Andy Perez has made the move from right attacking mid to right back, doing everything that has been asked of him defensively while still aiding the offense on the break.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were having trouble defensively. I just knew that if we went into postseason bleeding goals like we were, we weren’t going to go very far,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve controlled almost 70 percent of these games now. It’s been Duncan and Kevin together who have won us the balls in the midfield and this is what’s allowing us to put up 16-20 shots.”</span></p>\n<p>In their second round matchup with South Carolina, the Gauchos controlled the majority of the game before heading into overtime tied 0-0. However, less than three minutes into the extra period, junior left winger Ismaila Jome, who has been hampered with a left ankle injury for much of the season, curled in a brilliant right-footed strike from 20 yards out to notch the most important goal of his career and send his team into the next round.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6qnyWjgHu4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will be hoping to have starting goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg back for Sunday’s game after missing the last three halves of play and overtime with a bruised shoulder. The freshman earned an All-Big West Honorable Mention this season and was 13-4-1 in his 18 starts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke, who started the majority of last season, will fill in once again if the younger Vom Steeg is unable to play. Should the game go into penalties however, the Gauchos will likely elect to go with Vom Steeg because of his extra length.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offensively, UCSB will be hoping to get junior Nick DePuy out of a scoring drought that has lasted four games. The 6’4” forward is currently tied for second in the nation in goals scored with 15 and leads all players with eight game-winning goals. The Gauchos have never lost when DePuy has scored, going an undefeated 16-0-4 when he’s found the back of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That game will, number one, be a great game. But number two, player for player we’ll match them up all over the place,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “You’re not going to get 10 shots in the first half and we’re going to have to do better with less shots, but I keep feeling like the dam is going to break for us. We have 35 shots with 1 goal in the last couple games, so I just feel like we’re due.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be UCSB’s seventh Sweet 16 appearance in program history. The Gauchos earned a first-round bye when they were given the No. 15 seed in the tournament, clinching their 12th NCAA Tournament berth in the past 14 years in the process. It was the seventh time that UCSB has received a seed in the tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Clemson side, this will be the second consecutive Sweet 16th appearance for the program, making it 24 total in the school’s history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior forward T.J. Casner leads the offense with 10 goals, two of which he scored in last week’s postseason matchup against Elon. That mark is good for third-best in the ACC to go along with his conference-best six game-winners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Tigers rank first in the nation in assists at 2.3 a game and fourth in total goals with 48. A balanced attack has seen six Clemson players record double-digits in points this season, compared to four for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the first ever meeting between UCSB and Clemson, regular or postseason. The Gauchos will be looking to continue their run for their first NCAA Championship since 2006. The Tigers have two national championships, won in 1984 and 1987. This is their 15th tournament appearance since their title-winning run in ‘87.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everytime you’re in the NCAA Tournament, you’re going to have to hit that one game,” Vom Steeg said. “The 2006 team, we traveled and played the No. 1 rated team at SMU. This Clemson is our game. The fact that we’re playing in that game is where this team needs to be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos take on the Tigers at Historic Riggs Field this Sunday at 3 p.m. on ESPN3. The winner will face the winner between No. 7 seed Maryland and No. 10 seed Maryland next Friday in the NCAA Tournament Quarterfinals.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/","id":1469,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1468,1467,1466],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Swept in Season Finale at UCI, Finish Season with Program-Lows in Overall and Conf.

UCSB ended the year with a 7-20 overall record, its first time not recording double-figure wins in a season to go along with its 3-13 Big West record.</p>\n<p>Ending its season with three-straight home matches, UCI’s sweep of Santa Barbara earned itself a tie for fifth-place with Cal State Northridge. The Anteaters closed the year with a 13-15 overall and 7-9 Big West record.</p>\n<p>A matchup that ended with a two-point differential in the final three sets in the first meeting between these two teams, it was a similar ending in the match’s first set on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>It was a slow start for both teams as they were plagued by 10 errors apiece. UCSB earned a .026 hitting percentage in the opening set while Irvine had a .000 attacking percentage.</p>\n<p>Despite the sluggish start, UCSB managed to begin the match with a 4-1 run but could not hold off the Anteaters’ comeback effort. Down 5-7, a kill by junior setter Shelley Anderson ignited Irvine’s 8-0 run to help it take a 13-7 lead. However, the Gauchos responded with a 6-1 run of their own to cut the Anteaters’ lead to one at 13-14.</p>\n<p>A pivotal component within Santa Barbara’s trimming of UCI’s lead was senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva. Playing in her last match as a Gaucho, Villanueva registered four of her eight kills in the first set. Complementing the play of Villanueva was junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield as she registered a team-high nine kills.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB was able to come as close as one-point within UCI’s lead, the Gauchos could never tie or regain the lead as both teams traded points to close out the set. Three of Santa Barbara’s last four points came off of UCI errors and nearly forced an extra points finish but a kill by redshirt senior middle blocker Ella Rosenfeld secured Irvine’s 25-23 win for the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>A combination of kills and UCI errors helped UCSB to take an early 8-4 lead to start the second set but the Gauchos failed to maintain their momentum as it concluded the set with a -.025 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>While UCSB struggled to establish its hitting stroke, Irvine gradually improved, recording a .265 hitting clip and eventually went on an 8-0 run to go up 14-9 and force a UCSB timeout. The Anteaters’ scoring rally transferred into a latter 6-1 run to close the second set with its 25-14 victory as well as extended their lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s .206 attacking percentage, Irvine’s offense performed best in the third set recording a .400 hitting clip. Leading the Anteaters’ offensive surge was freshman opposite Harlee Kekaauoha.</p>\n<p>After recording just six kills in limited playing time in the team’s first contest against the Gauchos, she was most clutch in the last set, notching six of her match-high 10 kills in addition to a tied match-high of 12 digs.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ trend of playing from behind continued in the final set with UCSB taking a 4-2 lead but UCI’s consistency of scoring runs continued as it went on an 8-1 run to take a 10-5 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to answer with a 4-0 run of its own and trailed by one, 9-10. However, Santa Barbara could not overcome this one-point margin. As the deficit lingered, the determining factor in the Anteaters’ sweep was their 4-0 scoring run to earn a 21-16 lead and was the catalyst for the team’s 25-20 win in the third set.</p>\n<p>It was an encouraging start to the season for UCSB as it began with a 4-1 record, but the Gauchos’ inconsistencies in maintaining leads and closing matches hindered the team for the majority of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will lose a total of five seniors but the particular departures of Villanueva, outside hitter Ali Barbeau and opposite Britton Taylor will be most impactful on the Gauchos’ offense as the trio were responsible for 611 of the team’s 1,214 kills.</p>\n<p>Unable to fulfill its expectations of being a top contender in the Big West this season, the pressure will be on Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch and UCSB to retain its status as a legit competitor within the conference.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66811\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/ucsb-swept-in-season-finale-at-uci-finish-season-with-program-lows-in-overall-and-conf-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66811\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/ucsb-swept-in-season-finale-at-uci-finish-season-with-program-lows-in-overall-and-conf-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/ucsb-swept-in-season-finale-at-uci-finish-season-with-program-lows-in-overall-and-conf-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/ucsb-swept-in-season-finale-at-uci-finish-season-with-program-lows-in-overall-and-conf-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/ucsb-swept-in-season-finale-at-uci-finish-season-with-program-lows-in-overall-and-conf-wins/","id":5055,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5054,5053,5052],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Suffer 62-60 loss to UTGRV on Game-Winning Layup, Prepare for  Wyoming and Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11.24_StephenManga_WBBall-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11.24_StephenManga_WBBall-4-web.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite a 21-point effort by sophomore shooting guard Makala Roper and a game-tying layup by senior forward Kendra Morrison, the UCSB women's basketball allowed UTRGV to score a game-winning layup for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A game-tying layup by senior forward Kendra Morrison with seven seconds remaining in regulation knotted the UCSB women’s basketball team with the University of Texas- Rio Grande Valley at 60 apiece.

Protect the rim, make that kid make a pass at least. But we don’t lose it there. We lose it in all those stretches, we just kind of fall asleep and don’t attack. We didn’t rotate and protect the rim, it shouldn’t have never been.”</p>\n<p>Despite allowing an 11-0 run to open the third quarter and trailing 36-45 entering the fourth quarter, Santa Barbara nearly forced overtime in its comeback effort. Twenty-one points off the bench by sophomore shooting guard Makala Roper guided the team’s come-from-behind attempt. Her 21 points were a game-high in Thursday’s contest and were two points shy of her career-high of 23.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Savoy’s late basket handed the Gauchos their second consecutive loss, making them 1-4 overall while it boosted UTRGV’s overall record to 4-2.</p>\n<p>Although junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and sophomore forward Chaya Durr were added to the team’s starting lineup for Thursday’s matchup, leading UCSB’s 8-1 run to start the game was senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware.</p>\n<p>In just five minutes of play, she scored six points on 3-4 shooting. The Gauchos’ success on offense eventually led to the Vaqueros playing a “one-man” full court press. This caused some problems for UCSB when inbounding the ball but was not the primary challenge in facing Rio Grande Valley.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t a full-court pressure,” Henrickson said. “The inbounder has to just let it go. You’re just letting one guy dictate the flow of the game. We looked better in the second half but we struggled in the first half with it. Not that we turned it over, but we didn’t get much flow and rhythm.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had a season-low 12 turnovers, but even more problematic was the Gauchos’ foul trouble. Freshman forward Kali Jones fouled out in the fourth quarter with 4:09 remaining in the game in addition to a total of five UCSB players had two or more fouls.</p>\n<p>UTRGV capitalized on UCSB’s abundance of fouls, going on a 10-0 run to take an 11-8 lead to end the first quarter. Prior to fouling out, Jones started to establish her presence in the paint in the second quarter. She scored four of her six points in the quarter and finished the game 3-4 from the field.</p>\n<p>Jones’ minimal production in the game helped jumpstart the Gauchos outscoring the Vaqueros 34-18 in the paint as Durr, Roper, Ware and Morrison carried the workload down low while Jones played just 18 minutes.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 37.5 shooting and 14.3 three-point percentages, Santa Barbara’s consistent drive to the paint helped it go into halftime with a three-point lead of 30-27.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s foul trouble proved to be costly in the third quarter. Having to send Jones, Ware and Jemerigbe to the bench nearly two minutes into the quarter, the Gauchos’ reserves were fatigued and it was evident as the Vaqueros outscored UCSB 18-6.</p>\n<p>Scoring eight points in UTRGV’s 11-0 run was junior guard Shawnte’ Goff. Despite an off first half in which she had four points all at the free throw line, she finished the game with 15 points on 4-10 shooting, 2-3 from long range and recorded three steals.</p>\n<p>“We had some momentum going into the locker room but came out flat,” Henrickson said. “We made some energy plays but that wasn’t until the last four minutes. It’s not who you play, it’s not where you play but how you play.”</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB’s bench outscored UTRVG’s 37-10, scoring 31 of these points were Roper and Morrison. In the last 3:26 of the quarter, the two scored the team’s last 11 points.</p>\n<p>Roper scored the Gauchos’ first six points of the fourth quarter, cutting the Vaqueros’ lead to five at 42-47. After playing just five minutes in the first half, Morrison went 4-7 from the field and had seven of her 10 points in the fourth quarter. She was also responsible for Santa Barbara’s last five points in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite Morrison’s game-tying layup, UCSB did not get back on defense quick enough and was beat by Savoy going coast to coast for the game-winning layup.</p>\n<p>In the 3:40 mark of the third quarter, Durr suffered an undisclosed injury while committing a foul.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road this Friday, Nov. 25<sup>th</sup> at Wyoming at 6:00 p.m. in Arena-Auditorium. Wyoming is 2-1 after its 61-56 overtime victory over Big West counterpart Cal State Fullerton on Thursday. Santa Barbara will continue its road journey against Pepperdine this Sunday, Nov. 29<sup>th</sup> at 1:00 p.m. in Firestone Fieldhouse. The Waves are 1-4 after their loss 94-61 loss versus Alaska-Anchorage on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66813\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-suffer-62-60-loss-to-utgrv-on-game-winning-layup-prepare-for-wyoming-and-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66813\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-suffer-62-60-loss-to-utgrv-on-game-winning-layup-prepare-for-wyoming-and-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-suffer-62-60-loss-to-utgrv-on-game-winning-layup-prepare-for-wyoming-and-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-suffer-62-60-loss-to-utgrv-on-game-winning-layup-prepare-for-wyoming-and-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-suffer-62-60-loss-to-utgrv-on-game-winning-layup-prepare-for-wyoming-and-pepperdine/","id":406,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[405,404,403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to End Two-Game Skid at San Francisco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"After a couple of tough losses, the UCSB men's basketball team heads north to face the 3-1 Dons.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66795\" style=\"width: 252px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"150968616\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66809\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66795\" data-attachment-id=\"66795\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-look-to-end-two-game-skid-at-san-francisco/mbball_vsohio-20151121-dustinharris-7-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Looking for an open teammate, Maxwell Kupchak prepares to pass.

Despite only playing one game at home thus far, the Dons have gotten off to an impressive 3-1 start to the season.</p>\n<p>Establishing a flow on the offensive end will be one of the keys for the Gauchos at this early point in the season as they look to replace their offensive focal point from the last three seasons in Alan Williams. While they went 5-2 without Big Al last year, they haven’t found as much success this season, already matching their loss total in games without him and shooting just 36.2 percent overall and 23.4 from three-point range as a team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The starting backcourt of reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent and Eric Childress have struggled, with 25.8 and 31.3 percent marks overall, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson is the team’s top scorer, averaging 18.5 points a game.

The win earns the Gauchos a ticket to face No. 2 Clemson next Sunday in their seventh Sweet Sixteen appearance in program history.</p>\n<p>“It never gets old playing in the NCAA Tournament and I thought we were excited and ready to play tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We all know Ish’s season has been rough with [a sprained left ankle], but at least he picked the right foot to finish with that one.”</p>\n<p>After failing to win a postseason game the past two seasons, Santa Barbara has another chance to prolong a magical season in which it has gone 14-6-2 overall and 2-1 in playoffs. The Gamecocks conclude their season with a record of 11-8-2 after playing one of the most difficult schedules in the nation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This season I’ve been injured, it’s been frustrating but the team has done really well getting this 15 seed and first round bye,” Jome said. “It’s just been wonderful to win and get past the second round which has been a barrier for us the past couple seasons.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6qnyWjgHu4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>While the Gauchos had been dominated for much of the second half, they regrouped towards the end of regulation and came out strong in the overtime period, holding South Carolina without a shot attempt for the final 20:17 of play.</p>\n<p>“I was very proud of the strength and mental toughness that our guys showed,” South Carolina Head Coach Mark Berson said. “The big thing was we were able to link up passes, keep the ball, take a little pressure off ourselves. Credit to our guys that as the match went on, we got stronger, and I’m very proud of that.”</p>\n<p>That set the stage for Jome, who had just nearly scored on a header one minute prior, to pick up his third goal of the season and the biggest of his life. The final sequence began with junior midfielder Andy Perez whipping it into the box for junior forward Nick DePuy. The nation’s leader in game-winning goals nearly notched his ninth of the year, but his off-balanced, slightly deflected shot from seven yards out was cleared off the line by junior defender Matt McManis.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for UCSB, the ball fell right to Jome outside the 18-yard box. Although he has reminded us of just how dangerous he can be with his play during the postseason, setting up defenders to one side before bursting to his stronger left has become predictable at times. This time, Jome took on the defense to his right, catching Gamecock sophomore goalkeeper William Pyle off-guard as he placed the shot perfectly inside the far post.</p>\n<p>“I was going to cross it but they had two defenders blocking my left, so I thought ‘Why don’t I just go right for once?’” Jome said. “I had been practicing it in the spring, so I go right and I just hit it and thankfully it went in.”</p>\n<p>Multiple announcements had been made throughout the game warning fans that they would be ejected for throwing tortillas, but after being shutout for the previous 194 minutes playing at home, the sea of fans finally had its chance to erupt along with a cloud of blue smoke as the Gauchos celebrated emotionally on side of the field nearest to the crowd.</p>\n<p>It was a tale of two halves as UCSB outshot South Carolina 10-1 through the first 45 minutes before the road side stole all momentum in the second stanza.</p>\n<p>“[South Carolina] is a good team, so you can’t keep running at them the whole time,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>The game felt eerily similar to the Gauchos’ loss to Fullerton in the Big West Championship, as the Gamecocks came very close on a number of occasions in the second half, but were unable to place one past sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke, who for the second game was filling in for injured freshman Justin Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>“I thought Berke did everything we asked for,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “He was clean, punched a couple balls he had to punch. He is not going to cost you the game and he’s been training great, so tonight we went with the goalie who was 100 percent.”</p>\n<p>Other than the goal, the play of the day was provided by sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who led the Gauchos with four shots. Off a corner kick in the 37th minute, Feucht lined up a dazzling bicycle kick, which he hit perfectly on target. Pyle was in the perfect position to save it though as he was for most of the game, as he racked up one of seven big saves on the night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have now given up just one goal in their last four games, having found a lineup that works with senior Duncan Backus moving from right back to defensive midfielder. Perez was moved to right back in the game and played superbly, making clutch stops when he needed to and providing a great spark down the right wing.</p>\n<p>“Andy is a player who works hard for us, he’s disciplined enough, he tracks, he’s a hard working two-way midfielder,” Vom Steeg said. “The key in that whole move was simply getting Duncan back in the middle of the field, and if you’ve seen we’ve controlled almost 70 percent of these games now.”</p>\n<p>With the game potentially heading into penalties, Justin Vom Steeg warmed up from the bench, despite being held out with a bruised shoulder.</p>\n<p>His recovery will be watched throughout the week as he hopes to suit up for his team against No. 2 seed Clemson on Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/","id":1474,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1473,1472,1471],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Challenged by Oregon’s Size in 79-51 Loss, Host UTRGV on Tuesday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketballVS.CSUB-11192015-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketballVS.CSUB-11192015-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A lack of size in the paint resulted in the UCSB women's basketball team being outrebounded 24-40 in its 79-51 loss at Oregon on Sunday.

But the Gauchos responded with a 9-0 run of their own as a three-pointer by freshman guard CoCo Miller helped bring UCSB within three at 11-14.</p>\n<p>Miller finished with 10 points on 3-10 shooting, 2-7 from behind the three-point line and added three steals.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s three-point deficit would be the closest it came within Oregon’s lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Still, as Oregon attempted to increase its lead to double figures, the Gauchos continued to chip away at the Ducks’ lead. Trailing 14-21, two quick baskets by senior guard Jasmine Ware helped UCSB to trim Oregon’s lead to 23-18, forcing a Ducks’ timeout.</p>\n<p>Ware finished with a team-high 12 points and tied her career-high of five steals. Her basket with 6:24 remaining turned out to be UCSB’s last before being held scoreless for nearly the next three minutes of the quarter. Oregon’s 6-0 run during the Gauchos’ scoring drought resulted in it taking its first double figure lead at 29-18, causing UCSB to call a timeout.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer by senior point guard Dioseline Lopez at the 3:40 mark ended UCSB’s scoreless streak but wasn’t enough as Oregon held the Gauchos to another scoreless streak to go on an 8-0 run. Ending Santa Barbara’s scoring slump was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe’s three-pointer with 30 seconds remaining in the first half as Oregon entered halftime with a 37-24 lead.</p>\n<p>After combining for 12 points in the second quarter, Oregon’s duo of Alleyne and Vandenberg helped extend the Ducks’ lead in the second half, scoring 11 of the team’s 23 points in the third quarter. Alleyne emerged for seven points, helping Oregon take a 60-43 lead at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Contributing to Oregon’s 57.4 shooting percentage was senior guard Lexi Petersen. Despite a game-high seven turnovers, she scored 14 points on 6-9 shooting and was 2-4 from long distance.</p>\n<p>Oregon saw a decline in its perimeter shooting in the second and third quarters, going 0-6 from downtown but redeemed itself. It exploded for an 83.3 three-point percentage in the fourth quarter on 5-6 shooting from deep.</p>\n<p>The three-point shooting clinic resulted in the Ducks outscoring UCSB 19-8 in the final quarter. Between the time span of 4:58 through 3:07 remaining in regulation, they knocked down four consecutive three-pointers which led to their 79-51 victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to the Thunderdome this Tuesday, Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> to host University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley at 7:00 p.m. The Vaqueros enter Santa Barbara with an overall record of 3-2. It will be the first time the Gauchos and Vaqueros have ever faced each other.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66747\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/gauchos-challenged-by-oregons-size-lose-79-51/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66747\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/gauchos-challenged-by-oregons-size-lose-79-51/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/gauchos-challenged-by-oregons-size-lose-79-51/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/gauchos-challenged-by-oregons-size-lose-79-51/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/gauchos-challenged-by-oregons-size-lose-79-51/","id":401,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[400,399,398],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Poor Shooting Sees UCSB Drop Home Season-Opener to Oregon St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos finished just 33.8 percent from the field and 18.2 percent from three on their way to a loss to Oregon St. on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66717\" style=\"width: 226px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"229635873\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66737\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66717\" data-attachment-id=\"66717\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/gabe-vincent-tries-to-work-his-way-past-the-defense-dustin-harrsdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Gabe Vincent tries to work his way past the defense.

The Gauchos shot just 8-30 (26.7 percent) from the field and 1-12 (8.3 percent) in the second half on their way to a 71-59 loss.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara falls to 1-2 in the young season while the Beavers went undefeated on their two-game weekend road trip to improve to a perfect 4-0 start for just the second time since 2000.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Gary Payton II filled up the box score once again for his team with a game-high 21 points on 8-13 from the field and 3-4 from three-point range. The reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year also finished with seven boards, four assists and two steals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With a steal in each of his last 35 games, Payton II is just two short of the school record his father set from 1989-1990.</p>\n<p>An 8-2 run out of the gates by Oregon St. didn’t bode well for the Gauchos, who have had relatively slow starts in each of their first three games. UCSB answered with a 7-0 run, taking the lead after a pair of free throws by senior guard Michael Bryson, but the home side was only able to hold on to a 9-8 advantage for 12 seconds for its only lead of the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kept it close before a three-pointer by freshman guard Stephen Thompson Jr. gave the Beavers a 43-35 lead heading into halftime.

Bryson and senior forward John Green finished with similar numbers, both shooting just above 30 percent to score 14 and 16 points, respectively, to lead the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Sam Beeler was one of the few bright spots for UCSB, recording his first career double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 39-37 rebounding advantage and turned the ball over just nine times compared to the Beavers’ 13, but shooting proved to be the difference. As a team, Santa Barbara has a field goal percentage of just 36.2 so far this season and are a miserable 23.4 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>Missing the efficiency of their focal point from the previous three seasons in Alan Williams, the team’s remaining big playmakers will need to step up their game moving forward for UCSB to have more success.

Senior attacker Derek Shoemaker added a goal to make the score 7-4 with just over four minutes left.</p>\n<p>Although the game seemed like it was going to be easily won by UCSB, the 49ers did not go away easily, adding two goals to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 7-6 with just over one minute left. In its final possession, LBSU missed the shot and the clock ran out giving the Gauchos the victory and the seventh-place finish.</p>\n<p>Before ending on a high note, Santa Barbara lost to a team ranked lower than itself for the first time this season after a poor performance against UCI. It had beaten the Anteaters earlier in the season thanks to a game-winning shot. However, UCI was able to avoid the intense ending in Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ star senior driver Lovre Milos started the scoring by making a goal three seconds into the start of the match. UCSB responded by scoring two goals courtesy of Shoemaker but gave up two scores to the Anteaters as they took the 3-2 lead after the first.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker and Hamilton added two goals for UCSB in the second quarter to give it a 4-3 halftime lead. However, in the second half the team fell apart, surrendering five-straight goals.</p>\n<p>Within a span of thirty seconds into the third quarter, the Anteaters scored three goals to go up 6-4. They would add one more in the fourth to win the game 7-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ four goals tied a season-low. It would be in back-to-back matches they tied their season-low, having happened first in their quarterfinal matchup against Cal.</p>\n<p>The Bears scored two goals in the first quarter to take an early lead. UCSB’s lone goal in the first half came late in the second period thanks to Shoemaker. After his score, the Gauchos surrendered three-straight goals, going down 6-1 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Cal added two more goals to start the third and took a commanding 8-1 lead. With the quarter nearing the end, Shoemaker added one more goal to make the score 8-2 after three quarters.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker completed a hat trick in the fourth period, scoring his third score of the game. Hauschild also added a goal but the outcome was inevitable. The Gauchos lost 11-4, diminishing their hopes of winning their first MPSF championship in school history.</p>\n<p>Still, the two seniors that led Santa Barbara throughout the season put on good performances to end their careers as Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge tallied 40 saves on the weekend, ending his career with 895 saves, the second most in MPSF history. Shoemaker had six goals in the three games and finished the season as the Gauchos leading scorer with 48.</p>\n<p>Although the final weekend did not go the way UCSB intended it to go, it still had a solid season overall. The 16-11 finish was an improvement from the year before and overall, the team looked competitive in almost every match.</p>\n<p>The losses of the four seniors will have an impact, but the Gauchos still have plenty of young talent such as Hauschild, Jovanovic and Hamilton returning. The exposure that these young players gained from playing this season along with the growth of the rest of the team makes UCSB a considerable contender to emerge for a top finish in next year’s MPSF standings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They definitely had us beat in some positions with some size and that’s why you’ve got to take speed and quickness and beat them that way. We weren’t efficient enough.”</p>\n<p>The road trip to Santa Barbara was the Rainbow Wahine’s last match of the season. This year’s Big West Champions, Hawai’i finished with an undefeated conference record of 16-0 and will enter the NCAA Tournament with a 26-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>It will also enter the postseason with a 21-match win streak, its longest since winning 26-straight in 2011. Hawaii’s win over UCSB in straight sets was its third consecutive sweep of a team and its 16<sup>th</sup> sweep of the season.</p>\n<p>With great size, not only did Hawai’i dominate at the net but it also had a powerful attack. The Rainbow Wahine established an aggressive swing on the ball early in the match, recording a .393 hitting clip in the first set.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara showed signs of being able to defend Hawaii’s attack as it trailed 4-5. However, it was up until this point that Hawaii’s 5-0 run would increase its lead to 10-4, forcing a UCSB timeout. The Rainbow Wahine’s largest lead was 11 points and eventually resulted in them taking a 1-0 lead with a 25-16 win in the first set.</p>\n<p>Leading Hawai’i on the offensive end was junior opposite Nikki Taylor. Although she tallied a match-high 11 kills, she finished with a .111 hitting percentage, her third lowest in a match this season.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did some really good things out there,” Lantagne Welch said. “We passed well, we had a few big hitters. We held their best player [Taylor], she struggled tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to contain Taylor was most effective in the second set as it held Hawai’i to a .069 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Still, a -.156 hitting percentage and 12 errors plagued Santa Barbara in the set, allowing Hawai’i to capitalize on the Gauchos’ mistakes to take a 6-0 lead. Able to extend their lead to 20-9, it seemed like the Rainbow Wahine were destined to earn a blowout set victory.</p>\n<p>Despite the 11-point deficit, the Gauchos responded with a 6-2 run to trim Hawaii’s lead to 22-15. Senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva finished with a team-high seven kills. In spite of UCSB’s comeback effort, Hawai’i built upon its lead with a kill by Taylor and a block to earn the set-point lead at 24-15.</p>\n<p>But a 5-0 scoring run helped Santa Barbara to delay Hawaii’s pursuit of taking a 2-0 lead, causing the Rainbow Wahine to call a timeout. However, another kill by Taylor and a block by sophomore middle blocker Emily Maglio and sophomore setter Kendra Koelsch secured Hawaii’s 25-21 win.</p>\n<p>Another commanding start highlighted the Rainbow Wahine’s opening of the third set as they took an 8-2 lead, leading to a Gauchos’ timeout. While both teams traded points, UCSB could never overcome Hawaii’s lead and were forced to call a second timeout while down by a score of 13-20.</p>\n<p>Helping spark Santa Barbara’s last chance at avoiding being swept was freshman outside hitter Devin Joos as her kill ignited the Gauchos’ 5-0 run to cut Hawaii’s lead to three at 18-21. Joos and junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt both registered six kills and both recorded a .308 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>However, the momentum remained with Hawai’i as it needed four points to end the match. Earning these last four points was no challenge as the Rainbow Wahine ended the third set with a .500 hitting percentage to take the 25-19 win to close the match.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will end its season on Tuesday, Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> as it will face UC Irvine at 7:00 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66702\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66702\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/","id":5049,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5048,5047,5046],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jemerigbe’s Game-Winning Layup Earns UCSB’s First Win of Season in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02.21.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensBBall1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02.21.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensBBall1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe scored the game-winning layup to propel the UCSB women's basketball team to its first win of the season, 61-60 over Cal State Bakersfield on Thursday night.

A total of four Gauchos scored in double figures as the team shot 47.2 percent from the field, 33.3 percent from beyond the arc but had a season-high 26 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“You find a way to win because you get stops,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “When it’s a one-possession game, everything matters. Sometimes as coaches you draw plays and sometimes you have to go make a play, and she [Jemerigbe] made a play.”</p>\n<p>The come-from-behind win improves UCSB’s overall record to 1-2 while the Roadrunners remain winless at 0-2.</p>\n<p>From the game’s beginning, it was Jones with the hot hand, scoring eight of her 13 points on 4-4 shooting in the first quarter. She finished with her first double-double of the season, adding 16 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield showed its willingness to shoot the three-point ball early, making 3-6 shots from long distance. A late make from beyond the arc by redshirt junior forward Erika Williams with 19 seconds left captured CSUB’s 15-14 lead to close the quarter.</p>\n<p>Williams was the Roadrunners’ second-leading scorer with 13 points and shot 4-7 from long distance on the night. Overall, CSUB shot 43.8 percent from deep, making 7-16 attempts.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes occurred in the second quarter as both teams traded points. However, Bakersfield’s defense managed to limit Jones to just two shot attempts in the quarter, restraining her to one attempt from the field in the entirety of the second half.</p>\n<p>Ending the back-and-forth scoring was a three-pointer by CSUB freshman guard Addi Walters. The perimeter shot was the spark to the Roadrunners’ 11-3 run, resulting in their largest lead of the game at 35-29 to enter halftime.</p>\n<p>Scoring the first points in the second half was a three-point basket by UCSB sophomore guard Makala Roper. Despite a 0-2 shooting performance in the first quarter, she tied Jones for the team lead in points with 13. A reserve off the bench, she finished the game shooting 50 percent from the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>However, Bakersfield’s ability to restrain UCSB’s plan to feed Jones in the paint eventually led to the emergence of senior forward Batabe Zempare.</p>\n<p>Held to two points on 1-5 shooting in the first half, Zempare scored the Roadrunners’ first field goal of the third quarter. The score prompted Cal State Bakersfield’s 8-0 run which resulted in its 11-point lead of 47-36.</p>\n<p>Zempare would go off for 10 points in the fourth quarter and finished with a game-high 16 points. While her late scoring rally helped keep CSUB in the game, the Gauchos’ Jones did not believe she had lost the battle in the paint.</p>\n<p>“It was easy,” Jones said when asked about the matchup with the senior forward. “But the second half, she did start slipping the screens. I just started focusing on getting offensive rebounds and put backs.”</p>\n<p>Guiding UCSB’s comeback was the scoring outburst of freshman guard CoCo Miller. Scoreless in the first half, she erupted for all 10 of her points in the second half. She was responsible for seven points during the Gauchos’ 14-4 run.</p>\n<p>“She [Miller] got two layups, hit a three and stopped trying to pass it to everybody,” Henrickson said. “She’s a confident kid, she can shoot it.”</p>\n<p>Providing some valuable minutes off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris as she recorded a game-high four blocks. Santa Barbara’s defense held Bakersfield to a 38.2 shooting percentage and tallied a season-high 10 steals.</p>\n<p>A pair of made free throws by Zempare helped CSUB take a 56-53 lead but a clutch three-pointer by Jemerigbe was the equalizer to force the 56-56 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended up taking a 59-58 lead after a layup by Roper but were caught inattentively on defense by a backdoor cut and layup by Zempare to hand the Roadrunners a 60-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Due to the new NCAA rule that permits the advancement of the ball to halfcourt after a timeout is called and a score has been made with under a minute remaining, UCSB was able to call a timeout to set up the inbound pass to Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 26 turnovers, UCSB outrebounded CSUB 43-24 and outscored the Roadrunners’ bench 28-15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is right back on the road at Oregon this Sunday, Nov. 22. Tip-off will be at 12:00 p.m. in Matthew Knight Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66699\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66699\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/","id":393,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[392,391,390],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":92,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
