The 2016 Washington Mr. Basketball honoree ran for 39 minutes to put the clamps on a dangerous 49ers attack. He also added 15 points on 6-12 shooting with five rebounds in the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis and McLaughlin carried the bulk of the first half scoring for the Gauchos a combined 24 of the first 38 points in the former 20 minutes, while UCSB captain point guard Devearl Ramsey accounted for the majority of the helpers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, much like Fullerton, which relied on a triple-trap in the second half to shut down the ’Chos, Long Beach did its homework, and, immediately out of the break, ball handlers were met by a three-man ambush when they crossed the timeline in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this time around, Coach Joe Pasternack had an answer for the smothering defense in no man’s land — his name was Max Heidegger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger has struggled through conference play thus far, but his sharp intuition proved crucial to the Gaucho charge in the second as he stretches the floor with swift ball movement and active passes to the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Heidegger faked left and drilled a trey from the right wing, he returned and fired to wide-open Gaucho big men Robinson Idehen and Amadou Sow in the restricted area to stretch the floor and beat the triple-trap, which was detrimental to Santa Barbara’s attack against Fullerton. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preseason first-team honoree Max Heidegger finished with 10 points, six assists and zero turnovers, as his second-half effort was essential to UCSB’s success down the stretch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Heidegger back in his quarterback role to break the press, freshman Amadou Sow came alive with 12 points, shooting 5-6 from the field in the second half on his way to 14 points in just 15 minutes as he strived with foul trouble the entire night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sow picked up two quick fouls within the first two minutes of the game, which limited him to minimal minutes in the first, but since all of the Gaucho bigs were frequently whistled throughout the contest, Sow saw minutes toward the end of the second half although he had already been called for four fouls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six Gauchos were piped for three or more fouls while Mclaughlin, Sow and senior Jarriesse Blackmon each picked up four fouls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Deishaun Bookers cut the lead to 58-54 with 7:14 to play in the second, Max Heidegger, Devearl Ramsey and Ar’mond Davis delivered a triad of triples to inflate the the lead to eight, with the Gauchos on top 67-59 with five minutes to play to knock off the Niners. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After three straight on the road, the Gauchos head back home to host UC Irvine for a battle of first place in the Big West on Thursday, Jan. 30, with an 8 p.m. tip-off in the Thunderdome. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Before last night’s game against Cal State Fullerton, the UCSB men’s basketball team was one of 27 teams in the nation to be undefeated in conference play. Following a hard fought 81-60 loss to the Titans on the road, UCSB is no longer one of those teams.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos dropped their first game in over a month to move to 3-1 in conference play and slide down to second in the Big West Conference standings behind a 4-1 UC Irvine team. Fullerton, on the other hand, has been playing red hot to improve to 3-2 in Big West play behind a triad of skillful and nimble guards led by senior winger Kyle Allman Jr.</p>\n<p>Allman Jr. led all scorers with 21 points while shooting 7-13 from the field and 6-6 from the charity stripe as he dished out 4 assists en route to the Titans third win in a row. Senior Khalil Ahmad and junior point guard Austen Awosika added to the action with 19 points and 12 points respectively while all three guards had over 4 assists to fuel the Titan attack.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While UCSB scored the first four points in the game, the Titans’ pinpoint shooting and stout defense proved to be too much for the Guachos to handle. Fullerton shot 55.2% on field goals including a monsterous 63% in the first half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a 17-14 lead with 11:51 remaining in the first half after a four-point-play from freshman Jay Nagle, but that’s when the Titans started cooking while SB began to freeze up.</p>\n<p>Through three games, UCSB has focused on stopping one significant playmaker from Cal Poly’s Donovan Fields to Dikymbe Martin on Riverside and TJ Shorts II with UC Davis. Yet, the Titans had three elusive guards to spread the floor and the Gauchos had no answer for it.</p>\n<p>UCSB had a three and a half minute stretch with only two points when sophomore captain point guard Devearl Ramsey was off the floor, but his impact was felt immediately upon his return with seven minutes to play.</p>\n<p>Ramsey grabbed a defensive board and took it coast to coast to cut the Titan lead back to three and on the ensuing possession, the Sierra Canyon product delivered a contested trey to tie it up once again at 26 a piece with 6:22 on the clock.</p>\n<p>Fullerton turned it on at the end of the half to rout the Gauchos with a 22-5 run, 19 of those 22 points came from their three musketeers, who capped off consecutive buzzer beaters on the final two possessions of the half to balloon the lead up to a hefty 17-point deficit. On top 48-31 Fullerton ran into the tunnel at the break with the momentum fully in its control.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos muscled their way back in the second half behind 6 points in two minutes from sophomore forward Robinson Idehen to cut it to 55-42 with 14:06 left to play.</p>\n<p>The comeback felt imminent as UCSB was knocking down shots and getting stops. Devearl ramsey went on a 7-point run by himself to inch closer with 10:44 in the second half as he splashed a triple from the left wing to cut the deficit 9 points with a 59-50 lead for the Titans.</p>\n<p>Ramsey closed in with another three at 6:54 to cut it to seven, but that was the closest the Gauchos would get as Fullerton closed out another half with an assertive 18-4 run behind the final 11 points from Khalil Ahmad to put the nail in the coffin and hand UCSB its first loss since December 19 on the road in Omaha, Neb.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Dedrique Taylor made a crucial defensive adjustment in the second half as three Titans would collapse on the Gaucho ball-handler once they crossed the timeline. The Gauchos had no rebuttal for the Fullerton triple-trap and ultimately fell in the second half.</p>\n<p>While Devearl ramsey had 15 points and Jaquori Mclaughlin added 11 with a career-high 8 rebounds, UCSB struggled from deep, shooting 8-28 from beyond the arc. The team couldn’t finish from the line going 54.5% from the line on 22 tries. The Gauchos allowed 46 points in the paint compared to just 22 that UCSB was able to convert and the open looks for Fullerton attributed to its 55% shooting night.</p>\n<p>Four Titans scored in double-figures including a 12 and 12 double-double from junior forward Jackson Rowe as the Gauchos fell in Titan Gym. Although their overall 7-12 record may not reflect their skill level, Big West foes will be left bruised and burned if they don’t remember the Titans.</p>\n<p>UCSB men’s basketball heads to Long Beach State on Saturday evening for a 7 p.m. tip-off against the 49ers in Walter Pyramid.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85813\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-25/gauchos-stumble-at-fullerton-for-first-loss-in-over-a-month/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85813\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-25/gauchos-stumble-at-fullerton-for-first-loss-in-over-a-month/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-25/gauchos-stumble-at-fullerton-for-first-loss-in-over-a-month/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-25/gauchos-stumble-at-fullerton-for-first-loss-in-over-a-month/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-25/gauchos-stumble-at-fullerton-for-first-loss-in-over-a-month/","id":1081,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1080,1079,1078],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seek First Consecutive Wins of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WBasketball-vsLMU-Nov192018-AngieBanks-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WBasketball-vsLMU-Nov192018-AngieBanks-17.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following Santa Barbara’s home victory over Long Beach State, the Gauchos find themselves only one and a half games behind first place in the conference.

In the first two conference games — both losses — UCSB outscored its opponents by a combined score of 48-35 in the fourth quarter. On Saturday, that proved to be the difference against a feisty Long Beach State squad, with the Gauchos outscoring LBSU 17-11 in the fourth quarter en route to their six point victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps most importantly for the Gauchos, junior center Natalia Bruening was finally able to get going in conference play, dropping 16 points on an efficient 7-8 from the floor. Bruening’s ability to box out also helped UCSB dominate the glass, with Santa Barbara out-rebounding Long Beach by a massive 17 rebound margin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We defended better, something we have talked about as a team [all year],” Henrickson said. “If we aren’t scoring, we have to be better defenders. We forced Long Beach into some tough two’s, and it was one of our better rebounding games on both ends of the floor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impressively, UCSB pulled off the victory despite making only one three-pointer the entire game — a shocking stat considering the emphasis on three-pointers in the modern game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, UCSB will face a massive test when Cal State Fullerton (11-6,2-1) comes to town on Thursday. The Titans feature one of the most consistent offenses in the entire conference, with the team averaging nearly 68 points per game on the season. Much of the team’s success on that end can be attributed to its elite ball movement: CSUF averages nearly 16 assists per game and has four players averaging double figures on the season. This movement allows the Titans to get open looks, with the team as a whole shooting almost 44 percent from the floor on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton is led by sophomore guard Raina Perez — a floor general who leads the team both in scoring (13.9 ppg) and assists (5.4 apg). Perez has been a workhorse all season, averaging nearly 36 minutes per game while still remaining efficient.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the biggest surprise for CSUF this season has been freshman guard Amiee Book’s scoring off the bench. Arguably the best sharpshooter in the entire conference, Book is shooting 50 percent from beyond the arc despite taking four three’s a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fullerton has a very good post and they surround her with good playmaking guards who can shoot the three,” Henrickson said. “They do a good job of manufacturing offense, and they can score on every level. We need another strong team defensive effort on Thursday night.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its gaudy offensive numbers, Fullerton averages almost 17 turnovers per game — a fact that has at times proved to be its achilles heel. The Titans also give up almost 66 points per game, meaning the Gauchos should have plenty of room to operate their offense on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the ’Chos are to keep pace with Fullerton, they will need junior guard Coco Miller to be on her game. Santa Barbara’s leading scorer this season with 14.6 ppg, Miller dropped a career-high 33 points against Cal Poly earlier this month. In the win against LBSU, however, Miller struggled to find her shooting touch, going 0-5 from downtown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sledding should be slightly easier for UCSB on Saturday, when a struggling Hawaii team comes to town. Antithetical to CSUF’s offense, the Rainbow Wahine feature a rather anemic offense that has struggled mightily in conference play. In their last conference game against Cal State Northridge, Hawaii scored only 29 points in the entire game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, Santa Barbara can’t afford to overlook a squad that has already knocked off first-place UC Davis during conference play. What Hawaii lacks in offensive firepower, it makes up for with a defense that holds opponents to 40 percent shooting from the field. Even in its blowout loss against CSUN, Hawaii only gave up 49 points the entire game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Wahine are led by junior Makenna Woodfolk, a jack-of-all-trades forward who averages 11.8 points per game while also grabbing 5.9 rebounds per game — both of which lead the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to Long Beach State, Hawaii has struggled on the glass all season — an area that should pay dividends for the Gauchos on Saturday. Look for UCSB to try to feed Bruening inside and play out of her to break apart the stout Hawaii defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With momentum on its side and two home games this week, UCSB has a golden opportunity to jump back into the conference title race. The Gauchos will host the Titans on Thursday at 7 p.m., while their game against Hawaii will tip off on Saturday at 4 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

A real character building road trip,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Our confidence is getting good again, and we are ready to get some nice wins at home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their first opponent, Lewis, holds a 5-2 record but has not defeated any team that is currently ranked, and their two losses have come against No. 3 UC Irvine and No. 6 Pepperdine. Loyola-Chicago has a 5-1 overall record and, despite a loss to UCI, the Ramblers upset Pepperdine back on Jan. 18 in a five-set thriller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all teams having five wins, Santa Barbara’s road to that success has been a lot tougher considering that their last five matches have come against ranked opponents and they own the toughest schedule in the nation with their remaining opponents boasting a combined win percentage of .717. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, even though 5-3 is a good record, the Gauchos know they could be in a better position and have to play well in their upcoming games if they want to overcome their gruesome schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have the top schedule in the country and its because we want to be playing tough teams and get better to be ready when the playoffs come,” McLaughlin said. “We could easily be 6-2, if not 7-1, but that’s the way it goes. Sometimes it is better to lose so we can work a bit harder.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is 5-5 all-time against Lewis and has lost three straight meetings to the Flyers, including a 3-1 defeat in Illinois last season. If the Gauchos want to change their fortunes this time around, then they will need to find a way to break through a tough Flyer defense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lewis holds the 12th best opponent hitting percentage in the nation holding them to a .200 clip. The Flyers also average nearly 10 digs per set, fifth-best mark in the country, and three blocks per set, second-best mark in the country. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means UCSB will need to have an efficient, aggressive offensive showing and also need a big game from some of its offensive leaders such as senior outside hitter, Corey Chavers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavers leads the team in kills per set averaging 3.29 and has amassed 102 total kills thus far in the year. No other Gaucho has more than 50, meaning that the team has a nice balance with Chavers leading the charge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow teammate junior Keenan Sanders had a career day against Lewis last season finishing with a career-high 24 kills in that match. A repeat performance of that could put the Gauchos over the top. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offensively, Lewis is very team-oriented, with five players averaging two kills per set and no player having more than 66 kills in total.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are 2-1 all-time against Loyola-Chicago, losing for the first time last season, 3-1. Offensively, UCSB will need a similar game plan considering the Ramblers hold their opponents hitting percentage to just .174, ranking sixth in the nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season when these two teams met, Chavers led the team with 18 kills, but the next closest Gaucho only had nine apiece. More even distribution will be a big key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Loyola-Chicago even tougher, however, is that its offense is even better than its defense. As a team, the Ramblers average 13.86 kills per set, .363 hitting percentage and 12.68 assists per set. Those averages are the No. 2, No. 3 and No. 5 ranks in the country, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior outside hitter Collin Mahan is one of the biggest forces in the Rambler offense. The New York native recently was honored with the MIVA Offensive Player of the Week award thanks to a 28 kill performance in his team’s last two outings, including the upset win against Pepperdine where Mahan registered 18 kills on an efficient .309 hitting. This comes as no surprise as Mahan was also picked as the Preseason MIVA Player of the Year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, UCSB will need to rely on Senior libero Hayden Boehle who leads the team with 78 digs while Sanders leads the team with 25 blocks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, this weekend will be important for Santa Barbara to make some noise on a national level in the shadows of the bigger Big West teams. Currently, the top three spots in national rankings belong to Big West teams. If UCSB wants to be there, they will need to prove it with some big wins at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is always good to be at Rob Gym and I love playing teams ranked above us. They give us the challenge we need to get better and our guys will be ready,” McLaughlin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on Lewis at 7 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 25 at Robertson Gym. The match against Loyola-Chicago will be on Saturday, Jan. 26 at the same time and location.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

At the time, that was the highest ranking achieved by any Gaucho in history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most athletes, Moreno de Alboran has been playing tennis since he was a young boy. However, unlike most athletes, the New York native did not even start playing competitively until much later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really just started playing tennis just hitting a few balls around while I was in the Dominican Republic,” Moreno de Alboran said. “I never even took it seriously at the beginning, it was more of a hobby and a way to exercise.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Moreno de Alboran moved to England, he gained new insight into how much he loved tennis. He realized it would take a lot of work, but he wanted to compete at a high level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, by the time he started competing, most players who hope to pursue tennis at least in college have played at least in 100 tournaments, whereas Moreno de Alboran did not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was hard to get good, but as I got better I knew I wanted it so I had to compete in tournaments. But by the end, I only competed in about 20 tournaments as a junior which is nothing compared to most,” Moreno de Alboran said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, those tournaments were enough to garner some serious attention from some Division-I programs including UCSB and Head Coach Marty Davis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know it’s funny when we began recruiting him we actually did not know how little tennis he had played compared to most,” Davis said. “But we knew we wanted him and glad we got him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I got here Marty and Blake [Mueller, Associate Head Coach] gave me the opportunity to play and get better. I don’t think that would have happened anywhere else,” Moreno de Alboran said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the playing Moreno de Alboran did his freshman year certainly paid off. In his rookie campaign, the New York native posted an 18-8 overall mark and went 15-7 in dual match play. This was enough to earn him Big West Freshman of the Year honors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was and still am so grateful Marty and Blake gave me the opportunity to come to play here and show what I am capable of. Being in a team like this, in a school like this, has helped me to develop my game so much,” Moreno de Alboran said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little did Moreno de Alboran know he would improve significantly from his freshman year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Moreno de Alboran went 29-11 overall. He also became the first Gaucho to be invited to the ITA National Fall Singles tournament, was named the 2018 Big West Player of the Year, led his team to a fourth-straight Big West crown, earned the highest national ranking in singles in program history at that point and became the first UCSB athlete to win an NCAA Singles Championships match since 1995.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season, Moreno de Alboran already looks like he is ready to accomplish more. In just the fall tournament portion of the schedule, the three-time first team all-conference standout went 13-5 earning key wins against players currently ranked No. 5, No. 8, No. 33, No. 54 and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno de Alboran’s current No. 6 ranking is not only the highest in program history but also the highest of any Big West athlete in the last 22 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who would have thought that a kid who played tennis for fun growing up and didn’t even play competitively until late in life would be this good?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You always hope players turn out as good as Nic but you never know, how could you? We knew he had a world class forehand and he has built his game around that, but he has grown so much in all facets of his game that his game as a freshman compared to now is a night and day difference,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even Moreno de Alboran could not have expected to be in this position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No, I never thought I would be this good because I never saw tennis as 10 years ahead, five years ahead. I always stayed focused day by day. I never thought I would be playing against the best players in the nation and beating them,” Moreno de Alboran said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85809\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1858585371\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85807\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85809\" data-attachment-id=\"85809\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/moreno-de-alboran-set-for-storybook-senior-season/mde/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?fit=1799%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1799,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mde\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85809\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?w=1799&amp;ssl=1 1799w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85809\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moreno de Alboran (right) celebrating with fellow senior co-captain and doubles partner Anders Holm (left). <em>Photo courtesy of UCSB Athletics</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the work is not done.

For a small mid-major like UCSB and Moreno de Alboran usually just making it to a big game is seen as a win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year, Santa Barbara and their senior co-captain are ready to go beyond just making the big game, they want to win it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season, Moreno de Alboran came within a set of defeating the No. 1 player in the country, Martin Redlicki of UCLA at the NCAA Singles Championships after winning his first-round match the day before. That was good enough for last year, not this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nic is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no longer in the stage of just being happy to be here. He knows he deserves to be here and he knows he could hang with these guys, they aren’t that far in skill level anymore. Now he just has to go out there and beat them,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Davis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t see why I couldn’t beat anyone in this country right now. Those rankings are just numbers I don’t see them as better or worse, I see every match as an opportunity to grow and represent the Gauchos,” Moreno de Alboran said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the team as a whole, the Gauchos are poised for major success. In doubles, Moreno de Alboran and fellow senior teammate Anders Holm are one of the best pairs in the country. In singles, this team is talented from top to bottom including having junior Joseph Guillin play at the No. 2 court. Guillin is currently ranked No. 22 in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season, UCSB nearly upset one of the best tennis programs in the country, USC, at its own home in the first round of the NCAA Team Championships. The score ended 4-1 in favor of the Trojans, but if you were at the game, you would know the Gauchos were leading on all singles courts at one point and looked like they would win on most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was good enough for last season, not this one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year showed us our program was headed in the right direction. We have a goal this year, to win another Big West and to get our first NCAA win since 1998, and with Nic and some of our other guys I think we could do it,” Davis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost like it was meant to be, Moreno de Alboran and UCSB as a whole are peaking together at what feels like the right time. Just this past Saturday the Gauchos won their season opener 5-2 against San Diego State and Moreno de Alboran looked impressive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be interesting to see what awaits the program and the athlete that helped it turn into quite possibly the best mid-major in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I get goosebumps when I get reminded of that,” Moreno de Alboran said. “I am super grateful for my coaches, my teammates, this school and I am super excited for this season. It is my last one and I am ready to soak everything in.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 and p.4 of the Jan. 24th, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

As a high schooler, the attacker was named Girls Water Polo Player of the Year by the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin and received offers from big water polo programs such as USC. Her heart was set on UCSB from the jump, however, and she already seems poised to become one of the most lethal offensive players that the Gauchos have had in awhile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She knocked in two goals to put UCSB up 7-1 at the end of the first period, and they never looked back in their blowout win over the Lancers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s dominance would not stop there, however. On Saturday the Gauchos went on to win their next two games by a combined score of 30-10.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They first faced off against Fresno State, who surprisingly jumped out to an early 2-1 lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresno seemed determined to not let the main players on UCSB get any room, but this actually opened up space for the rest of the team to get involved. By the end of the match, 10 different Gauchos had found the back of the net, and UCSB pulled away with a 15-5 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second matchup of the day was supposed to be their toughest one yet, as they took on No. 13 ranked Indiana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were unflappable, however, and thanks to a Sarah Snyder hat-trick they jumped out to a 6-1 lead in the first period. Snyder has been a consistent positive presence on both sides of the ball for the last two years, and is set to take on more of a guiding role this season for the young talent. She set off what turned out to be another dominant 15-5 win, and UCSB ended the day that much closer to a tournament victory and national ranking of their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final day of the invitational did not end the way the Gauchos wanted, but they did pick up a place on the national leaderboard and came close to upsetting an undefeated UCLA squad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB first faced off against No. 14 Wagner, and again it was Snyder setting the tone early. The utility player scored in the early moments of the match, and the Gauchos relied on their stingy defense to come away with a 9-4 win. This win propelled UCSB to No. 17 in the country, and set the stage for a tough battle against No. 3 UCLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two squads were tied 3-3 at halftime, the Bruins eventually pulled away late for the 6-4 victory. They came away as the only undefeated team of the invitational with a 5-0 record, while the Gauchos dropped to 4-1 on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a promising start for the women’s water polo team, especially considering how well the young players performed. Underclassmen such Legaspi and Mollie Simmons outplayed some of the top players in the country, and as they continue to grow into their roles this team could easily become Top 10 in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will have a week off and then head over to Arizona State for the ASU Invitational on Feb. 1.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Gauchos will also be coming off their most recent road win after traveling to and defeating UC Davis by a final score of 69-58.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altogether, the Gauchos currently boast a 14-3 overall record on the season. Notably, those three losses have all come from away games. UCSB still remains undefeated, 9-0, when playing at home in the Thunderdome. The men’s team will look to maintain their winning ways and continue their excellent momentum through this week’s pair of conference games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Fullerton’s campaign hasn’t gone quite as well. The Titans are at a 6-12 overall record on the season and have only won one of their nine away games. When it comes to defending their home court, however, they have done well as they find themselves at a 4-2 home record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans’ have recently been on a small hot-streak of their own. Fullerton has won their last two games, with their most recent victory being a 92-90 overtime win against Long Beach State. Historically speaking, UCSB has faced Cal State Fullerton a total of 86 times, with the Gauchos leading the all-time series at a record of 47-39. The last time these two teams faced each other came in January of last year, where a close fight resulted in a 70-65 Gaucho road win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Saturday’s opponent, Long Beach State’s season has been a bit better. Currently standing at an overall record of 8-11 on the season, the 49ers have shared a similar form of poor play on the road when compared to their ability to play at home. Boasting a 6-2 record whenever they’re the hosts, Long Beach State will pose yet another challenge for the Gauchos come time for tip-off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 49ers’ most recent form has also proven promising, as Long Beach State has won three of four games in the month of January; as they’ll be coming off their most recent, aforementioned, overtime loss to Cal State Fullerton. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of the all-time series against the Gauchos, the 49ers take the advantage in this one with a 76-59 lead over UCSB in the 126 total games they’ve shared. The Gauchos will also look to even the score, considering Long Beach State was also the victor the last time these two sides faced; which resulted in a devastating 69-70 home loss for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, this season has proven much more promising for the Gauchos, as this team full of veteran and young talents continues to shine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players to watch for the Gauchos include graduate guard Ar’mond Davis and freshman forward Jay Nagle. Davis is coming off an impressive 23-point performance in the latest win against UC Davis, also adding eight rebounds and two assists to his total. As for Nagle, he managed eight points from off the bench and a pair of rebounds in his 16 minutes of play.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Titans’ end, the Gauchos should expect a two-pronged offense revolving around senior guards Khalil Ahmad and Kyle Allman Jr. Ahmad and Allman are the only two scorers on their team to have surpassed 300 points on the season, and the dangerous duo has also combined for a total of 54 assists through the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the 49ers, senior guard Deishuan Booker has been lighting up the scoreboard as of late. He leads his team in overall scoring and also in assists, with a total of 78 to his name. This week’s recurring theme will be prolific guards, as the Gauchos will have to game plan against their next opponents’ outstanding backcourt players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A conference standings update is in order, as the Gauchos are currently the only undefeated team in Big West play. Sitting atop the table at a 3-0 record, the only other team with three wins is UC Irvine, whom UCSB will be facing at home next week. Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State find themselves at the middle of the table, both with only two wins. An important week for the Gauchos in terms of conference standing and opponent difficulty, snagging two road wins would mean the world for UCSB’s competitive campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is set to travel and face Cal State Fullerton this Thursday, Jan. 24, at 7 p.m., then Long Beach State this Saturday, Jan. 26, also at 7 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><em>A

Redshirt junior Coco Miller started to find her rhythm as she swished a couple mid-range jumpers which gave the Gauchos some momentum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller came into this game red hot as she had a career high scoring performance with 33 points, with 18 of those points coming from behind the three-point line. Although it was a slow start, she would make a huge impact in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither team could create separation from the other in the third period with both teams seemingly scoring at will. Junior center Natalie Bruening dominated in the post as she used her size to convert easy layups. For LBSU, junior forward Cydnee Kinslow had an outstanding third quarter with two threes as well as a couple of steals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruening has started to find her confidence as of late on the offensive end of the floor as she is attacking the basket aggressively, leading to an increase in free throw attempts. Going forward, it will be crucial that she sustains this level of play because it will force defenses to double her in the paint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were finally able to gain some breathing room as they outscored the 49ers by six points in the final eight minutes to come away with the victory. Danae Miller not only hit a clutch mid-range floater with the shot clock about to expire but iced the game from the free throw line as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the keys behind their victory was their ability to hold the 49ers to 35 percent shooting from the field, which can be attributed to the persistent ball pressure. All five players on the court were communicating on the floor as well which kept LBSU from finding their rhythm offensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another welcoming sight for UCSB was the balanced scoring between Danae Miller, Coco Miller and Bruening who combined for 46 of the team’s total 60 points. This is extremely encouraging for a team that has struggled to find a second scorer to emerge behind Coco Miller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although sophomore guard Bri Anugwom did not make an impact scoring the ball, her contributions on the other end of the floor cannot be overlooked as she grabbed a career high fourteen rebounds in the contest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to build upon this game, they will need to continue to bring maximum defensive effort as they still build chemistry on the offensive end. Moreover, they will need to continue to play team basketball and avoid the ball sticking in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be back in action next week as it faces Cal State Fullerton at home on Thursday Jan. 24 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Following a berth into the College Insider Mid-Major Top-25 poll, the Gauchos continued their Big West dominance to hand Davis its third straight loss and drop the Aggies to 0-3 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>While Ar’mond Davis impressively went 5-7 from deep en route to his prolific near double-double performance, the Gauchos as a whole shot 45.8% from beyond the arc. They held the Ags to just 27% on threes despite UC Davis shooting more efficiently from the field than SB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Reigning Big West Conference MVP TJ Shorts II posted 11 points for the Aggies on 5-11 shooting while dragging down a team-high five boards in the process, but when a 5-foot-9 point guard is the team’s leading rebounding, it’s certainly apparent why Davis has been struggling this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded UC Davis 37-21– a monstrous 16-rebound differential made possible by 12 offensive boards from UCSB which led to 12 second chance points on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Although the Aggies attack came out firing with a 10-0 run to open up the game, the Gauchos fired back with a triple from junior guard Max Heidegger to get SB on the board.</p>\n<p>“The first four-minute war, we were down 10-0. I felt like I was back at Washington,” joked Pasternack. “I better change my pregame speech and my half time speech.”</p>\n<p>Heidegger quarterbacked a 14-4 stretch for UCSB after freshman guard Sekou Toure muscled into the paint for consecutive offensive rebounds and dipped it back to a wide-open Jay Nagle, and the three-point specialist struck again to tie it up at 14 with a trey on the right wing.</p>\n<p>Nagle had eight points in the first half while shooting 3-4 from the field and 2-3 behind the perimeter as he added the final five points of the half for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UC Davis pulled back ahead with a pair of free-throws, but Ar’mond Davis answered right back with his first three of the game which came unassisted as shook his defender in isolation at the top of the arc and fired from deep to put SB on top 17-16.</p>\n<p>To close out the half, Santa Barbara posted 26 points with big threes from four separate Gauchos to lead 43-31 at the break. After one, there were six Gauchos that had notched five or more points with Armond Davis leading the way scoring 10 points in 14 minutes.</p>\n<p>Out of the break, the Ags weren’t done yet. Davis went on a 14-5 run to open the half on a strong note once again led by junior guard Joe Mooney who carried out a 3-point play when he cut through defenders, drew contact, and finished at the rack to cut the deficit to just three at 48-45.</p>\n<p>That was the closest the Aggies would be to a comeback as Ar’mond Davis took over with 13 points in the second half with a triad of triples to balloon the lead to 64-54 with 3:53 to play.</p>\n<p>“I really challenged Ar’mond Davis about offensive rebounding last night and I think he was a monster,” said Head Coach Joe Pasternack. “Four offensive rebounds and he was a complete player…to get a victory like this on the road, this is amazing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is off for a week off following its sixth straight victory, but has a big week ahead as it remains on a 3-game road trip with games at Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach next Thursday and Saturday respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

This road game is following the Gauchos’ long home series of five consecutive games at the Thunderdome, with their last away game occurring back in Dec. 19 of last year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ 13-3 overall and 2-0 conference record is enough to place them at the very top of Big West Standings, with UC Irvine falling in second place and CSUN in third.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UC Davis finds themselves at the bottom of the table at a 4-12 overall and 0-2 conference record, but a surprise win will do them the world of good in terms of conference standings. The Gauchos are red hot entering this game, considering their current five-game win streak that they’d like to extend over the Aggies.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s most recent win occurred last weekend in another Big West showdown at home against UC Riverside, which ended in a 72-64 final score that favored the Gaucho hosts.</p>\n<p>On the season, UCSB stands at an overall record of 13-3, with an outstanding 9-0 record when at home.</p>\n<p>Although on paper this upcoming match may appear to be a trap game, UCSB is actually 2-3 when it comes to their performance on the road.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, UC Davis is 3-2 when defending their home court, so both teams will want to bring those respective records to an even .500 win percentage.</p>\n<p>A win for the Gauchos will bring their win streak to six in a row and further cement their status at the top of the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>As for UC Davis, the Aggies will want to get their act together quickly, even in this unlikeliest of matchups.</p>\n<p>On the season, UC Davis holds an overall record of 4-12, including constantly poor showings on the road with a 0-9 away record.</p>\n<p>The month of January has been a bit fairer for the Aggies, who have won one of three matches over this period.</p>\n<p>Although both of those losses were well fought and one of them was an overtime heartbreaker, these pair of road games were both Big West confrontations and are the reason for UC Davis’ presence at the bottom of conference standings.</p>\n<p>Historically, this will be the 39th time these two sides have faced off against each other.</p>\n<p>From the 38 other previous meetings, UCSB leads favorably with a 29-9 all-time series record. The last meeting between these two occurred last year, where the Aggies upset the at-home Gauchos by a final score of 71-54.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, conference matchups are always prone to go either way, regardless of a perceived advantage.</p>\n<p>After an incredible showing last week against UC Riverside, UCSB’s freshman forward Amadou Sow is this week’s one to watch.</p>\n<p>At 6’9”, Sow enters the UC Davis game following a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds; each stat was game-leading in the aforementioned match.</p>\n<p>A vital part in head coach Pasternak’s team layout, Sow has been tearing up stat lines all season long, leading his side in total rebounds, with 100 to his name, and fourth in both total scoring and minutes played.</p>\n<p>Another player to watch would be the Gauchos’ senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon.</p>\n<p>Slowly starting to see more consistent minutes, Blackmon has made the most of his play time as he leads his team in total blocks with 17, and he is third overall in total rebounds with 67.</p>\n<p>Both Sow and Blackmon will feature as UCSB’s premier rim protectors against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>On the opposing end, Aggies’ senior guard TJ Shorts II is in charge of making the offense function.</p>\n<p>As UC Davis’ leader in total points and assists, Shorts II already has 239 points and 60 assists to his name.</p>\n<p>He’ll also be hungry for a win after coming just short against last week’s opponent in Long Beach State, a match where he added 19 points, five assists and three steals to his tally.</p>\n<p>Coming off a team-leading 29 points against Long Beach State, junior guard Joe Mooney will be in fine form entering the UCSB game.</p>\n<p>Mooney appears to be the Aggies’ three-point specialist as he leads his side in three-pointers, with a total of 29 on the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will want to keep both Mooney and Shorts II in mind come game time.</p>\n<p>Although Davis is currently in last place, their play so far this year has been an outlier, not the norm. With the return of AJ John to the lineup for the Aggies, the Gauchos can’t afford to take the win for granted.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be the visiting side this Thursday, Jan. 17, as they travel to UC Davis for a tip-off time 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

\r\n</script> \n<p>After sitting out last year, she has certainly made her presence felt by not only being a threat from the three point line but also by being a playmaker for her teammates as well.</p>\n<p>With the story of the game being a game of runs for both squads, it was the Mustangs who were able to pull the game out as they were able to knock down clutch free throws to keep the Gauchos from completing their comeback attempt.</p>\n<p>Although Long Beach State has faced similar struggles as UCSB with a 4-10 record on the season, they have started to find their rhythm as of late with three straight wins with their most recent win against UC Riverside where they won by 18 points.</p>\n<p>They were able to get the victory through a balanced scoring attack where four of their players were in double figures with junior forward Cydnee Kinslow leading the way with 14 points, 12 of which came from behind the three point line.</p>\n<p>Despite going on multiple five game losing streaks this season, Long Beach State has been able stay the course, which can be attributed to their recent success.</p>\n<p>Kinslow and sophomore forward Naomi Hunt have been instrumental as far as leadership goes and will look to continue to keep their teammates on the right track.</p>\n<p>With the 49ers playing their best ball of the season, it will make them a very difficult opponent for the Gauchos as they look to find their identity as a team.</p>\n<p>In order for Santa Barbara to succeed against a red hot Long Beach State team, they must keep everything in front of them and prevent the 49ers from getting easy baskets in transition. It will be crucial for junior center Natalia Bruening to rebound the ball consistently and limit second chance opportunities for Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a second scorer must emerge behind Miller in order to prevent opposing defenses from doubling her. There are many different players on the team that have the potential to fill this role, including Bruening, who can score easily in the paint, as well as sophomore guard Bri Anugwom, who is constantly in attack mode and can lead to getting to the line.</p>\n<p>One of the strengths for Long Beach State is their ability for every player on the floor to be a threat from behind the three point line. Santa Barbara must play with consistent ball pressure that may lead to turnovers for the 49ers and fastbreak baskets for the ‘Chos.</p>\n<p>Although it has been a difficult year thus far for Santa Barbara, there are many positives to take away, especially the team’s consistent effort. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson has been able to bring the best out of her young team and will look to build on the habits being developed this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to pick up their first conference win as they face Long Beach State at 4 p.m. this Saturday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Angie Banks/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, Boris Jovanovic’s water polo career has been remarkable — enough to etch his name into the Gaucho history books. The 6’1” senior driver has caught everyone’s attention since his arrival here at UCSB years ago, but his fourth and final collegiate season was the most impactful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although his tenure here has been a great success, his story of moving from Novi Sad, Serbia, and how water polo led him here is quite unique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My journey here to UCSB was actually very extraordinary,” Jovanovic stated. “None of my family had ever visited or lived in the United States. I didn’t really know how any of the programs worked, but in America I saw a great opportunity. The coaching staff here was incredible and far beyond any others at the collegiate level; that made the decision to come here easy.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the early part of his collegiate career and his initial experience with UCSB’s water polo program, Jovanovic’s response was, “It’s a change of mentality, a change in understanding with this team, a different approach altogether. Prior to this season I was not used to carrying such a work load, leading this team and fitting in as the captain. Growing into that position was a hard process, but I found great camaraderie with the team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, one can quickly notice the importance that Jovanovic’s stats had on the team’s overall performance. Through the 26 total games that he played, he closed the year with 78 goals, which impressively averages out to a hat trick a game, while also adding 10 assists to his name. His scoring production not only led his team but also had him tied for the most in the entire Golden Coast Conference.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very satisfied with what I’ve done; I think I helped the team out and believe I always did my best both in practice and in games. My teammates also helped me reach my individual goals and reached a level of success I hadn’t expected nor planned for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jovanovic’s great stat line also translated to the team’s shared success. With a final Gaucho overall record of 18-8, this year’s record was tied for the program’s all-time best, with the last 18-8 mark occurring back in 1991. Thanks to such a great campaign, the NCAA also ranks UCSB within the top five men’s water polo programs in the nation.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As far as the team goes, I’m very proud of what we had accomplished. This year the team was very well-structured; it was a group of people who all had the same goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the bright future in store for the returning Gauchos, Jovanovic said, “We have a great group of people who are returning, and changing one element [i.e. his departure] definitely won’t change the whole machinery that was created.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To add to their team’s success, four Gauchos were recognized with All-GCC honors: Jovanovic, sophomore goalkeeper Tiago Bonchristiano, junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic and sophomore attacker Leo Yuno.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Further recognizing his teammates’ play, Jovanovic added, “To name only a few other people who didn’t get the nod, probably because they had to include more people from other teams: Jacob Halle, Tommy Fellner, Cole Brosnan and Adam Lott. They and many others are all coming back, and I believe UCSB will have its strongest year next year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jovanovic’s accolades don’t end there, however, as his 78 goals this year was the seventh most ever scored in a single season at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, his career total of 178 goals earns him the fifth place spot among career scoring leaders. “It’s something that I’m truly proud of and happy about because it’s what will remain of the four years I’ve spent here; it brings me a lot of joy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides his obvious scoring prowess, Jovanovic was also asked about what he believes is the next best part of his game, to which he replied, “It’s usually hard to talk about the best parts of your game and easy to talk about what I could improve, but if I had to choose one thing, I hope I provided leadership and the will the fight until the end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked about his most memorable moment, he said, “The most memorable moment of the season was the team huddle, every time before jumping in — the cheers that we did, as well as being able to stand there in front of the guys and say a couple of words to motivate them, hopefully.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This altogether concludes Jovanovic’s stellar performance for the Gauchos, but if you ask him about what else is in store for him, he’ll respond with the utmost satisfaction and confidence.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t have any more water polo aspirations; I have been playing this sport for some 15 years and I feel really satisfied with what I’ve been able achieve here at UCSB. I’m now working on personal goals for my career, but I think with water polo this was may be the last year, and I’m very proud that I could be in a Gaucho cap here with my team … I’ll be their biggest supporter and I look forward to hopefully watching the best games UCSB’s ever had.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, Jovanovic added, “It’s worth mentioning again that the team and coaches worked hard together … ultimately, the most important thing was that we achieved something together through hard work and it’s something we all fought for. It’s something that I want to thank all those people for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  <em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily

With the loss, the Gauchos now drop to 3-12 on the season, and sit in last place in the Big West with an 0-2 record during conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, Saturday’s game magnified the issues the Gauchos have had all season: slow starts, inefficient offense and lack of depth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In front of a home crowd of 1,100 people, the Mustangs came out firing in the first quarter, desperate to pick up their first conference win of the season. In that quarter, Cal Poly outscored Santa Barbara 18-10, shooting 50 percent from the floor while holding the Gauchos to only 33 percent shooting. Perhaps most importantly, the Mustangs outrebounded UCSB by a margin of 9-4, with junior center Natalia Bruening having to sit for Santa Barbara after picking up two early fouls. Once again, the Gauchos found themselves having to play from behind the entire game, only holding the lead for 21 seconds in the entire game.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Miller’s career night, Santa Barbara’s offensive deficiencies once again hamstrung their ability to keep pace with the Mustangs. After scoring only 3 points in the first quarter, Miller went ballistic on the offensive end, scoring 30 points combined in the last three quarters while shooting 59 percent from the floor and 50 percent from deep. One of the biggest bright spots for the team this season, Miller displayed her elite shooting touch on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Miller, however, the Gauchos shot merely 37 percent from the floor; in fact, the rest of the team made combined for only two three-pointers on the night. With Bruening logging only 14 minutes due to foul trouble, Santa Barbara lacked a presence in the paint </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forcing them to take difficult shots all night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Coco Miller and sophomore guards Danae Miller and Bri Anugwom </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who both scored 12 points on the night </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no Gaucho player scored more than 4 points on Saturday. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson once again relied heavily on her starters, with the Santa Barbara bench contributing only 4 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, Cal Poly found themself getting good looks all night. For a normally anemic offense, the Mustangs played one of their best offensive games of the season, shooting 50 percent from the floor. With seven players scoring more than 7 points each, the Gaucho defense struggled to contain the balanced Mustang approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the night, Cal Poly was paced by senior guard Dye Stahley, who scored 16 points on 4-9 shooting. Freshman guard Maddie Willett also played one of her best games on the season, scoring 15 points while shooting 60 percent from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Gauchos should be commended for their effort despite what has been a trying season. Just as they did against CSUN two weeks ago, UCSB outscored Cal Poly in the fourth quarter in a valiant comeback attempt. Unfortunately, as has been the case for much of the season, they fell just a little bit short.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to get back on track in conference play, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to Long Beach State. After struggling in non-conference play, the Beach picked up a commanding victory last Thursday, defeating UC Riverside 63-45. With only a 4-10 record on the season, however, LBSU should be a beatable opponent for a Santa Barbara team that desperately needs a morale-boosting victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After opening conference play with two road games, the Gauchos will return home for their game on Saturday against Long Beach State, with tip-off slated for 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

We love playing here, we love the fans and we have to continue to make sure we stay undefeated at home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four Gauchos hit double-figures as freshman facilitator Amadou Sow was the pulse of the SB attack with a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds from 10-18 shooting, and he came out firing with six of the first eight Gaucho points in the game.  Sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and Davis each scored 12 points in the contest, and in the back court McLaughlin also added five assists with zero turnovers and two takeaways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a swipe from McLaughlin at 14:26, the sophomore pushed his tempo, split defenders and cut to the rack before a swift kick-out pass to Davis who knocked down a triple from the far corner to put UCSB up 11-6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB pulled ahead early, Riverside battled back behind a sharp three-ball attack spearheaded by junior guard Dikymbe Martin. Down 23-18 with seven minutes to play in the half, Martin corralled his own miss and pulled up with a teardrop in the restricted area to cut it to a one-possession game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After forcing a miss from UCSB on the other end, Highlanders’ redshirt sophomore guard Dominick Pickett nabbed another offensive rebound on the attacking half of the floor with a split-second look back out to Martin who drilled a right-wing jumper from behind the arc to knot it up at 23 apiece.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebounding was huge for the Highlanders who led at the half 34-32 following 18 boards before the break and a +4 rebound-margin against the top team on the boards in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the first half belonged to UCR, the Gauchos came to play in the second with a 7-0 run to open up behind five points from Ramsey in the first two minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, Riverside continued to fight. The three ball was working for the Highlanders who had five treys in the second, including a smooth stroke from sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy who tied the game up at 46-46 with 13:37 to play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams traded threes over the next five-minute frame before Ramsey put his foot down and ultimately took over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Riverside up 56-53, Gaucho senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon cut to the hoop and floated under the basket before firing a pass to Ramsey in the corner who nailed one from deep to tie it up at 56.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the ensuing possession, Ramsey received an outlet pass from Sow and barreled coast-to-coast with a spin in the lane to draw the contact and count the bucket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it’s time to finish the game or when my team needs a spark, I have to pick my energy up,” expressed Ramsey after his 20-point performance. “Whether that’s defensively or offensively, I try to do whatever it takes for the team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that point on, the Gauchos didn’t look back as McLaughlin delivered an alley-oop from 35-feet out to Sow at the basket who threw it down and put the nail in the coffin to hand the Highlanders their 12th loss of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB sits in a tie for first place in the Big West with UC Irvine and Cal State Northridge after a pair of conference games, while Riverside dropped to sixth following a couple of heartbreaking losses to open Big West play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos take to the road for a three-game stretch with their first Big West Conference away matchup at UC Davis next Thursday with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m. at The Pavilion. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

That game in particular displayed the growth of the young Gauchos side, with the team keeping the game close throughout despite junior Coco Miller–the team’s leading scorer–shooting only 2-17 from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s offense–the biggest culprit for the team’s slow start–has seen an uptick since sophomore guard Danae Miller came back from injury. Danae’s four assists per game leads the team, and her speed has allowed the Gauchos to play more in transition, leading to easier baskets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last game against CSUN, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson opted to tighten up the rotation, playing both Danae Miller and Coco Miller for almost the entire game. While the Gauchos scored 73 points in that game, the bench contributed only 11 of those points–with all 11 coming from junior forward Tal Sahar. As conference play continues and fatigue becomes more of a factor, Henrickson will need greater production from her bench if the Gauchos hope to stay competitive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one game into conference play, it’s risky to call any game a must-win matchup. Still, for two teams that have struggled mightily throughout the season, a win on Saturday will aid greatly in getting their season back on track. Given both teams’ offensive struggles and defensive prowess, expect a low-scoring affair on Saturday where 60 points may be all that’s needed to secure the win.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly (0-1, 3-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Poly women’s basketball team enters Saturday’s match just as desperate for a victory as any other Big West team after getting thumped at home by UC Irvine in their conference opener, 75-59.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the season, Cal Poly comes in with a 3-9 record, with only two of those victories over division I opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to the Gauchos, the Achilles heel for Cal Poly all season has been their offense, with the team scoring only about 60 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, however, the Mustang’s offense has been slightly more potent since the return of graduate transfer Hana Vesela from injury.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her three games this season, Vesela has averaged almost 11 points per game. As she gets more acclimated to the team’s offense, her offensive output should continue to increase even more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s game will be a battle of two nearly identical teams when it comes to play style. Both teams look to play inside out, featuring their big on the inside to swallow up rebounds and finish off easy layups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Mustangs, sophomore center Devin Stanback leads the team with 13.6 points per game while shooting an impressive 51 percent from the floor. For Santa Barbara, junior center Natalia Bruening has essentially played the same role, scoring 10 points per game while shooting 50 percent from the floor. Imperative to both team’s success on Saturday will be their stud center staying out of foul trouble–an issue that in particular has plagued Bruening throughout the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly also excels on the boards; despite their overall struggles, they have consistently out-rebounded their opponents throughout the season. For a Gauchos team that prefers to play with four guards, it will be imperative for them to box-out and limit any easy second chance opportunities for the Mustangs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State (0-0, 3-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being picked to finish fourth in the Big West preseason poll, Long Beach State struggled significantly in non-conference play. With both an anemic offense and an undersized core that has been dominated on the glass, LBS limps into conference play with a 3-10 record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Led by sophomore guard Shanaijah Davison’s 14.8 points per game, Long Beach State averages fewer than 60 points per game. Even Davison — a preseason All-Big West pick — has struggled with her efficacy, shooting only 37 percent from the floor despite taking almost 15 shots per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Long Beach has been able to keep it close — with five of the team’s losses scoring in the single digits — the team has been sunk by its 59 free throw percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Long Beach has played with a relatively solid defense — they currently hold opponents to 43 percent from the floor — their Achilles heel all season has been their lack of rebounds. On average, Long Beach State has been outrebounded by 16 rebounds per game, allowing their opponents to have second-chance opportunities despite their solid initial defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, they will enter conference play with a bit of momentum on their side after winning their last two non-conference matchups, including a 50-48 victory over Utah State in their last game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that game, graduate transfer forward Cydnee Kinslow made her season debut after sitting out the first 12 games injured, and immediately made her presence known by grabbing nine rebounds in 37 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The addition of Kinslow should help Long Beach play more competitively.    Though Long Beach State has struggled most of the season, don’t be surprised if Davison cleans up her offensive efficiency and leads the team to a .500 record in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UCI (1-0, 13-1)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Irvine women’s basketball team was selected to finish in third place by the Big West preseason poll with only sophomore forward Jordan Sanders earning a spot on the preseason All-Conference Team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, 13 games and one league match into the season, there is no doubt that the Anteaters are the team to beat thus far into conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UCI is at the top of the Big West conference with a 1-0 league record and, more importantly, an 11-2 overall mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the Anteaters two losses came against a very tough Oregon team ranked No. 5 in the country but the other came against a much weaker San Diego State team that is just 5-8 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDSU did beat two other Big West programs in Hawai’i and Cal State Fullerton but lost to UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UC Irvine is the only team in the league thus far to have double digit wins and that is in large part to the performance of Sanders who is averaging an astonishing 21.1 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is not just the best mark on her team but the second best average in the Big West sitting just behind UC Davis’ Morgan Bertsch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders also leads her team in rebounds per game with 5.5 boards per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also receives help from fellow teammates Lauren Saiki and Andee Ritter who both average double figures in points per contest.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With three stud players on offense, UC Irvine hopes it can continue its great start to the year and possibly earn a Big West title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine takes on CSUN on Saturday at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUN (1-0, 7-8)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team is currently 7-8 on the year and will look to get back to .500 as they played their second game of the conference schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been an up and down year for the Matadors but they were able to pick up a win in their most recent matchup against UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are led by senior center Channon Fluker who is averaging a double double on the year with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She also leads the team with the highest field goal percentage from the field with 48.3 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the problems that the squad has faced this year is that they lack a consistent second scorer behind Fluker. With no one on the team averaging double figures besides Fluker, it has been difficult at times for them to put up points consistently. With them in the midst of conference play, it will be crucial for a second scorer to emerge in order to keep opposing defenses from keying on Fluker in the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, CSUN has been very impressive on the defensive end of the floor as they have held opponents to just 38 percent from the field. Much of that can be attributed to the consistent ball pressure which has led to opposing offenses struggling to find the bottom of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Matadors to turn their season around, they will need to find more ways to score the basketball, which also means that they must improve their three point percentage. With more consistent from behind the three point line, it will help keep defenses honest which will lead to easier shots for every player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN is back in action at UC Irvine where they will look to pick up their second win in conference play at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hawai’i (0-1, 4-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Big West play in full effect, the Hawai’i women’s basketball team is set to bounce back following a tough league opener loss to Cal State Fullerton.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Hawai’i has struggled all year long boasting just a 4-10 overall mark to this point in the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Rainbow Wahine are just 1-4 away from their home court.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, they will return home for a quick two-game stretch with matches against UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just recently, Hawai’i had won three straight games with two coming against well known division I programs but it is now losers of three straight. It’s last two losses have been by a combined five points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were hoping to turn around this season and, despite a loss at the Cal State Fullerton, they still played a great game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Jan. 5, the Rainbow Wahine scored 68 points which was their third highest point total this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i’s big scorer in that game was redshirt sophomore forward Amy Atwell who came up huge. She scored a career high 25 points in just 16 minutes with 18 of those points coming in the second half alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the season, Atwell averages just four points a game, even after that terrific coming out party. With an increased role maybe she can be a factor this team needs to turn it around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Rainbow Wahine will hope to continue relying on junior forward Makenna Woodfolk who leads the team in points per game with the only player in double figures at 11.8.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, in the last three games she has averaged just three points per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i will host UC Davis on Saturday at 1 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUF (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal State Fullerton women come into Big West play in 2019 one year removed from finishing last in the conference, missing out on the Big West Tournament and losing 12 out of their final 13 games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, however, their season is moving in a totally different trajectory, as they are currently sporting a 9-5 record and have won seven of their last eight contests —  including a win over Hawaii in their conference opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans have a roster that contains a mixture of upperclassmen and underclassmen that provide valuable contributions to the squad. Four players are scoring in double figures on the season and that group is lead by redshirt senior Daeja Smith, whose averages of 13.8 points per game and 9.7 rebounds per game rank fifth and second in the Big West, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Smith, one of the keys to Fullerton’s early season success has been the playmaking ability of their backcourt duo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raina Perez and Jade Vega both average double-digit scoring numbers to go along with their averages of five-plus assists per game, each.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez and Vega rank second and third in the Big West in assists per game, giving Fullerton added versatility  as the two players are capable of handling the ball and playmaking for others on the floor. The ability that Perez and Vega have to score and assist the ball complements the inside scoring game of Daeja Smith and makes their team as a whole extremely difficult to guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans finished in last place a season ago and were yet again picked to finish last according to the Big West preseason poll, but with the improved play of their returning players and the addition of some elite newcomers, Fullerton will look to turn the tables on the conference and show everyone that they can be a legitimate force in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside (0-1, 6-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conference play for women’s basketball is now in full effect, as the second fixture for UC Riverside’s Big West campaign is set for this Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off a close 59-67 defeat to UC Davis, for their first Big West confrontation, the UC Riverside Highlanders will look to improve as the young conference schedule begins to ramp up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far through the season, the Highlanders find themselves at a 6-9 overall record; enough for a .400 win percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signs point upwards, however, as the team evenly split their game schedule in the month of December, snagging a couple of road wins along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although, they’ll want to find their rhythm as soon as possible considering they dropped their first conference matchup of the new year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside’s redshirt junior guard, Jannon Otto, leads all scorers on the team with 195 points to her name so far through the season; that’s a 13 point per game average. Playmaking seems to also run through her as she also leads her side in total assists with 47.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close behind Otto, in scoring, is junior forward Marina Ewodo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Featuring as the squad’s premier rim protector, Ewodo leads all her teammates in blocks, with 33, as well as rebounds, with a total of 107.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, these two tend to be at the top of opponents’ game plan as they play such a crucial part on the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of conference performance, UC Riverside finished as a middle of the table team in Big West standings last year; ending their campaign with a 6-10 overall record in conference play, good enough for the sixth seed in the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, they did perform very well during the postseason, making it as far as the semifinal stage; ultimately giving the No. 1 overall seed, UC Davis, a nail biter of a game after falling just short by a final score of 46-49.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as this young year goes, their 0-1 start places them in sixth place once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectations are high however, as a better league finish can set up yet another surprising playoff run for the Highlanders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up on UC Riverside’s schedule is another Big West bout, this time against Long Beach State, who is 3-10 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Long Beach State’s first Big West matchup, but the Highlanders should have a slight upper hand entering this one.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside hosts Long Beach State this Thursday, January 10th, in the SRC Arena at 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re the two-time defending regular season Big West champs. They’ve lost just four regular season Big West games in the last two years. They’ve got the fifth-leading scorer in the nation. They’ve won six games in a row.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis women’s basketball team is the team to beat in the Big West. That’s been the case for a couple of years, and a slow Aggie start isn’t enough to change that this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCD, now 9-5 and 1-0 in the Big West after beating UC Riverside, started this season 0-3. That mark included a blowout loss to then-no. 7 ranked Stanford and tough losses to Pacific and Portland State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That start seems to be in the past now for head coach Jennifer Gross’s squad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eighth-year coach has guided her team and steadied the ship, even despite some key graduations from last year’s group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the court, the turnaround has largely relied on the back of Morgan Bertsch, a 6’ 4” senior forward who’s fifth in the NCAA, is the leading scorer in UC Davis program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertsch goes, so does the Aggie’s offense. That hasn’t been a problem considering the senior’s production, but it gives opponents an obvious point to focus on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Point guard Kourtney Eaton has been the woman in charge of feeding Bertsch, a job the four-year starter and the program’s all-time assist leader has performed capably with 5.1 assists per game. Junior forward Nina Bessolo works as Bertsch’s scoring complement with 9.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game while sophomore Cierra Hall leads the team with 6.9 rebounds per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to the rest of the Big West, the Aggies love the three-ball. UCD has put up 333 threes so far this season, more than any other rival school. Only UCSB comes close with 331, and the Gauchos’ 26.1 percent mark from deep pales in comparison to UCD’s 32.4 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that shooting and all those points – the Aggies are second in the Big West in points per game at 71.4 – hasn’t come at the expense of their defense. UCD has given up just 62.5 points per game, again second in the conference, and are holding opponents to a Big West-worst 36.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis is rolling on both ends of the court right now as they begin to defend their crown again. It’s hard to bet against them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big West Prediction: UC Davis (Hard to bet against the champs when they’ve got the best scorer and maybe the best defense).</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
