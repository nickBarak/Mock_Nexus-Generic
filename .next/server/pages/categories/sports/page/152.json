Numbers alone, though, do not encapsulate the breadth of their impact as teammates in and out of the pool.</p>\n<p>“If you have a team that has white-collar workers, the people who are full of statistics, they must have the blue-collar workers with them to make them shine,” Neushul said. “Rachel and Shelby are the blue-collar workers. There’s no doubt about that.”</p>\n<p>Nelson and Haroldson individually accrue the most minutes-per-game for UCSB, and their experience and grit in playing the trenches have been pivotal in creating opportunities for the team.</p>\n<p>“This team’s success relies 100 percent on them,” Neushul said. “They are the two players that never come out of the game, ever — the only two.”</p>\n<p>Both players say that their inspiration to play water polo stemmed from an early exposure to team sports and the swimming pool. Nelson and Haroldson became drawn to the sport after their sisters introduced them to the game in high school.</p>\n<p>“[My sister] started playing in high school before me, and I actually like playing a game in the pool,” Nelson said. “It’s a lot more fun than just swimming.”</p>\n<p>As seniors now looking to lead the Gauchos through the Big West Championship this weekend, Nelson and Haroldson have stepped into the role of leaders not only in the games, but outside practice as well.</p>\n<p>Both study biology and strive to maintain focus in the pool as well as in the classroom. Nelson was recently honored as a Big West Scholar Athlete of the Year.</p>\n<p>“They’re both very serious students; they’re not your typical Gauchos,” Neushul said. “They make the right choices all the time, in the pool and out of the pool — that’s the kind of role model that I want on my team.”</p>\n<p>Nelson and Haroldson also endeavor to impart advice they hope will be helpful to future UCSB water polo squads.</p>\n<p>“The examples that they’ve set here will carry on into the future; it already has,” Neushul said. “[Other players] now understand what it takes to be a student-athlete thanks to Rachel and Shelby.”</p>\n<p>With their last chance for a NCAA Championship bid on the line, Nelson and Haroldson figure again to be a dependable and dynamic presence in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We want to do well; even if we don’t win, I want to play well,” Haroldson said. “And I want to be playing the last couple minutes of our last game.”</p>\n<p>If history is any indication, there will be no plans for them to come out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsbs-behind-the-scenes-leaders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsbs-behind-the-scenes-leaders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsbs-behind-the-scenes-leaders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsbs-behind-the-scenes-leaders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsbs-behind-the-scenes-leaders/","id":5136,"author":{"id":362,"name":"Roy Kim"},"related":[5135,5134,5133],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2013 NFL Draft Full of Linemen","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The NFL draft begins on Thursday and will conclude on Saturday in what will be a marathon of a three-day event where many teams will fill their biggest needs with promising young stars.

Last season, five rookie quarterbacks started in the first week of the season. This year, however, there is a lack of elite quarterback prospects, with the majority of the top players in this year’s draft sitting on the defensive side of the ball. Linemen on both sides of the ball will be the story of the 2013 NFL draft. Here is a look at the biggest needs for each of the first 10 teams selecting along with a projected selection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kansas City Chiefs: Luke Joeckel, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although Kansas City has needs along the defensive line as well, I don’t see the Chiefs passing up a franchise left tackle in Joeckel who currently ranks as the top overall player on most experts’ draft boards. With this pick, Kansas City can solidify the important left tackle position to protect their recent investment in former 49ers quarterback Alex Smith. Joeckel gives the Chiefs a dominant and well-balanced blocker who can give the quarterback time and open up lanes for running back Jamaal Charles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jacksonville Jaguars: Dion Jordan, DE/OLB, Oregon</p>\n<p>Jacksonville could go a number of ways here but, as has been the sentiment for what seems like the past decade, the Jaguars need help in the pass rush. Jordan is one of the best athletes in this year’s draft and is a proven commodity with his level of production for a successful Oregon program. He can definitely help to improve Jacksonville’s pass rush and switch between defensive end and outside linebacker.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oakland Raiders: Sharrif Floyd, DT, Florida</p>\n<p>After a few mediocre seasons in which they showed signs of life, Oakland returned to the bottom tier of the NFL once again after a disappointing season. The Raiders have a number of needs and could look at Geno Smith here, but that pick would be a reach so I have them taking Floyd, a dominant run stopping defensive tackle who can help the Raiders bulk up along the defensive line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Philadelphia Eagles: Eric Fisher, OT, Central Michigan</p>\n<p>So much for new head coach Chip Kelly making a giant splash with his first pick in the draft. Pressure is on the Eagles to find a new franchise quarterback in Geno Smith, but Smith would once again be a reach here. Fisher would provide the Eagles with a solid tackle that can play on either the right or the left side and help protect whoever Philadelphia decides to run out at quarterback. Maybe Philly makes a move later in the draft to get Geno.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Detroit Lions: Dee Milliner, CB, Alabama</p>\n<p>Cornerback isn’t the most pressing need for the Lions, but it certainly couldn’t hurt to have a defensive stopper like Milliner, especially in a division where the Lions must face the Packers and Aaron Rodgers twice a season. If Fisher is available here, I think the Lions’ priority is finding pass protectors to keep Matthew Stafford upright and healthy, but, in this case, Milliner is the choice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cleveland Browns: Ezekiel Ansah, DE, BYU</p>\n<p>Ansah is a raw prospect with as much potential as anyone in this year’s draft, but he is somewhat unproven. Cleveland needs help with the pass rush and Ansah seems like the player with the highest potential reward. He is a freak of an athlete that can really help provide the Browns with a defensive presence to create havoc for opposing quarterbacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Arizona Cardinals: Lane Johnson, OT, Oklahoma</p>\n<p>This draft is full of impressive linemen on both sides of the ball and it shows with the third offensive linemen taken already. Arizona doesn’t need a quarterback now that they have Carson Palmer, so the Cardinals should focus on improving the offensive line. Johnson is the best available prospect in terms of value and need. He may not be as talented as Joeckel or Fisher, but Johnson presents a solid prospect that can help to solidify a weak Arizona line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Buffalo Bills: Chance Warmack, OG, Alabama</p>\n<p>Warmack is one of the most impressive offensive guard prospects in the last several years and will help Buffalo to establish a pretty good offensive line. The Bills could reach for a quarterback here so Ryan Nassib makes sense for Buffalo, but not this early in the draft. Look for Buffalo to address the quarterback situation in the second round or trade up into the later parts of the second round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Jets: Barkevious Mingo, DE/OLB, LSU</p>\n<p>The Jets sucked last year and that mainly falls on the lack of quality quarterback play. Unless the Jets find a match with either one of their two first round picks, they may stick with Mark Sanchez for another season and help to reload what used to be a scary defense. Mingo adds versatility to a Jets defense that is in need of an intimidating pass-rusher, especially when facing Tom Brady twice a season. Without Darrelle Revis, the Jets need to refocus on bringing back that defensive mindset that helped them advance to the AFC Championship two years in a row.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tennessee Titans: Jonathan Cooper, OG, North Carolina</p>\n<p>Cooper is a more athletic guard than Warmack and can provide the Titans with a solid player to help create room for Chris Johnson. Cooper’s athleticism will prove valuable when he is pulling downfield and setting up blocks for Johnson. Tennessee needs pass rushing help and could look at Star Lotulelei, but the defensive tackle is more of a run-stopping specialist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall, I’m projecting five offensive linemen and four defensive linemen to go in the top 10 with the only non-linemen being Dee Milliner. This draft class is obviously rich with linemen on both sides of the ball. I feel that no teams will choose a quarterback in the early parts of the first round and will instead wait to either trade up into the first round or wait until the second round to find their man.</p>\n<p>Quarterback is the most important position in the game, but there is no sense in forcing a pick when there are talented linemen galore available. However the draft shakes out on Thursday, be sure there will be surprises aplenty. This year’s NFL draft is as hard to predict as any in the last decade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2015883844\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50984\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50985\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/2013-nfl-draft-full-of-linemen/eagles-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Eagles Art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50985\" alt=\"Eagles Art\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of April 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Santa Barbara could not shake off its trouble on the road, finishing the season 4-10 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>After starting the season 3-9 in conference, the Gauchos posted a near-perfect record in March, including a seven-game winning streak to propel them into the seventh seed of the playoffs. However, Santa Barbara had a disappointing conclusion to its season and ended up losing four of its last five games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UC Irvine continues its run as the hottest team in the nation, extending its winning streak to six games. At 23-6 overall and 19-6 MPSF, the Anteaters seemed poised to reclaim the national title as they advance to the league semifinals against the third-seed Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB still has an outside chance of reaching the Final Four by earning the only at-large bid available, but their first round exit and overall record makes that possibility highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth first set ended up going to UC Irvine who had to fend off a resilient Gaucho attack to win the frame 26-24. UCSB responded as best they have the entire season, winning the second (25-22) and third set (25-20) to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite the lead, Irvine won the fourth set decisively 25-19 and built a five-point lead in fifth set, ultimately winning the final frame 15-10 and eliminating UCSB from the postseason.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht once again led the Gauchos in kills with 19, but Irvine was able to contain his offensive efficiency and limited Licht to a .205 hitting percentage. Licht added 10 digs and four blocks on defense.</p>\n<p>In his final game wearing the UCSB uniform, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis finished off his impressive career by recording six kills and four blocks. His 441 total blocks ranks third overall in program history.</p>\n<p>Irvine advances to the next round primarily on the play of junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. Tillie delivered on both ends of the court, finishing with 15 kills and seven digs. His three kills in the final set proved to be the difference as he delivered the final point of the match to send the Gauchos back home.</p>\n<p>The middle blocker tandem of juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring was effective in containing the Gaucho offense and held UCSB to a .213 hitting percentage for the game, compared to a .285 clip for the Anteaters. Kevorken and Mehring combined for 12 kills and 11 total blocks in the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have to fill the huge void left by Davis and its three other seniors, including outside hitter Miles Evans, but the remaining players can rely on the experience and chemistry established this year going forward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50974\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50974\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/","id":5307,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5306,5305,5304],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Cal Poly in Final Game of Regular Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M_Tennis_FilePhoto1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M_Tennis_FilePhoto1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s tennis team finished its regular season Saturday with a 5-2 loss against no. 65 and rival Cal Poly.

Despite losing, the performance from Recknagel was still impressive due to Dome being considered one of best individual players in NCAA tennis.</p>\n<p>The loss means that UCSB will now enter the Big West Tournament as the fifth seed.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly, on the other hand, clinched at least a share of the Big West Tournament with the win over the Gauchos and they could end up gaining the number one seed for the tournament.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament begins on April 25 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells, California.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50963\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-fall-to-cal-poly-in-final-game-of-regular-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50963\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-fall-to-cal-poly-in-final-game-of-regular-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-fall-to-cal-poly-in-final-game-of-regular-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-fall-to-cal-poly-in-final-game-of-regular-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-fall-to-cal-poly-in-final-game-of-regular-season/","id":225,"author":{"id":291,"name":"Austin Richardson"},"related":[224,223,222],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Two of Three at Home Against Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2585.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2585.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  This weekend the UCSB baseball team played host to fellow Big West rivals Long Beach State and came away with a series win going 2-1.

Junior second baseman Jeff McNeil doubled to lead off the game and two productive outs brought him in to score the only Long Beach run of the day.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ half of the first inning, sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward walked and junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon hit a two-run home run into right field for the only two runs UCSB would score.</p>\n<p>From that point on, both pitchers were in total control. Long Beach junior starting pitcher Shane Carle pitched six and a third innings, allowing just the two runs on seven hits. The bullpen went on to pitch an inning and two thirds of hitless relief work while striking out four.</p>\n<p>Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone showed why he is the Gauchos’ ace. Pettibone allowed only one run in the first and cruised through eight and a third innings, striking out five in the process to improve to 5-2 on the year. Freshman reliever Dylan Hecht came in to get the last two outs, both strikeouts, to collect his fourth save on the year.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara came away with another one-run victory in walk-off fashion. The two teams exchanged the lead in the second, third and fourth innings until Long Beach put up a three spot in the sixth to take the lead on a three-run home run.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came back with one run in the eighth to tie it up late before a walk-off single by sophomore centerfielder Cameron Newell ended it in the bottom of the ninth to a score of 5-4.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, reigning Big West Pitcher of the Week in freshman Robby Nesovic took the mound for the Gauchos to try and complete the sweep. Nesovic was roughed up for seven runs, six earned, through just two and a third innings.</p>\n<p>“We thought we had [this] since Nesovic went out last week and was really good — he threw the ball well at Fullerton but he wasn’t able to repeat his performance,” Checketts said. “We will have to go back to the drawing board and figure out why and see what we need to change in his routine to get him more dialed in. He just wasn’t dialed in today. He was elevated and struggled with his breaking ball.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could not get the offense going until the later innings when they put up two runs in both the sixth and the seventh innings.</p>\n<p>Nesovic helped his own cause when he homered in the sixth for the Gauchos first run.</p>\n<p>Trinkwon, who hit his second home run of the weekend, also drove in his fourth run of the weekend in the bottom of the seventh. Over the last four games, Trinkwon has really turned it on, as he is five for his last 15 with six RBI.</p>\n<p>“I’ve just been trying to stay more simple and short to try to help my team,” Trinkwon said. “I have got into a couple counts where I could actually swing it and wasn’t afraid to, and I helped the team out.”</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB will be a rematch with the University of San Diego this Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50972\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50972\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/","id":4669,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4668,4667,4666],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Third Consecutive Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/w_waterpolo_filephoto.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/w_waterpolo_filephoto.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  The No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team dropped its final match of the season Friday against conference rival No. 14 CSU Northridge, 13-9.

She also pitched in on offense, going 2-3 in the game. She improved to a 14-12 record as starting pitcher this season.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first four innings, Santa Barbara got on the board off the second home run of the season by junior first baseman Lauren Boser.</p>\n<p>Taking a 1-0 lead into the fifth inning, UCSB was able to add to their lead with an RBI from senior centerfielder Jessica Soria. Soria reached on a fielder’s choice to bring junior third baseman Jessica Reichner home and give her team a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Wisdom was able to silence the 49ers offense until the bottom of the seventh. LBSU finally got on the board when, with two outs, sophomore infielder Ashley Holmes knocked a single to right center to bring in junior utility Sarah Carrasco. Nevertheless, UCSB’s defense was able to stop Long Beach from there, earning the 2-1 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s second game Saturday saw the Gauchos fall behind early and UCSB was unable to catch up on the way to a 5-2 loss.</p>\n<p>Down three runs in the sixth inning, sophomore infielder Jenessa Jeppesen trimmed the 49ers lead to just one with a two-run homer.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the sixth though, junior pitcher Andrianna Collins was unable to keep UCSB close and LBSU tacked on two more runs to go up 5-2. The Gauchos were held scoreless in the final inning.</p>\n<p>The first meeting between the two was the most one-sided. A couple of three-run home runs, first by senior infielder Nalani St. Germain in the second inning and next by Carrasco in the sixth inning, buried the Gauchos on their way to a 6-0 loss.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Amanda Hansen shut out UCSB, despite giving up nine hits on the day.</p>\n<p>After scoring just four runs in three games this weekend, the Gauchos’ offense showed that they still haven’t gotten out of the offensive slump that has seen them score just 13 runs in their last 11 games.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, the Gauchos will need to be sharp offensively for their next game at No. 19 UCLA Wednesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50973\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-21/gauchos-salvage-series-with-sunday-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50973\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-21/gauchos-salvage-series-with-sunday-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-21/gauchos-salvage-series-with-sunday-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-21/gauchos-salvage-series-with-sunday-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-21/gauchos-salvage-series-with-sunday-victory/","id":995,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[994,993,992],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head to Irvine to Begin Postseason Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_001.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_001.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It’s one and done from here on out.

Irvine (22-6 overall, 18-6 MPSF) enters as the second overall seed in the conference, having ended the regular season with a five-game winning streak.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the two previous meetings between the teams in the regular season, UCI defeated Santa Barbara on both occasions, sweeping the first game at Rob Gym 3-0 and prevailing at home 3-1. However, UCSB has evolved into a completely different team in the two month span since the last time these teams played.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht has turned into the go-to player for the Gauchos, recording double-digit kills in his final seven games of the season and leading the team in kills for much of that span. Having only made one total appearance as a substitute in both games against the Anteaters, Licht will add an extra dimension for UCSB’s offense.</p>\n<p>The game has added meaning for senior middle blocker Dylan Davis. In what quite possibly may be his final game of his collegiate career, Davis, the lone remaining starter from the team that reached the title game two years ago, has guided the team for much of the season and brings proven postseason experience to a relatively young squad.</p>\n<p>The team captain has delivered for the Gauchos throughout the season, posting 1.37 blocks per game and averaging a .438 hitting percentage, ranking third and sixth in the conference, respectively. In the first match against Irvine, Davis was forced to exit from the game early due to injury and could not play in the final crucial moments of the match.</p>\n<p>Sweeping five of its last seven opponents, UC Irvine enters the playoffs as the hottest team in the country and ready to repeat as champions. With the best middle blocker tandem in the league, juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring, Irvine is second in the MPSF in opponent hitting percentage (.238). Kevorken and Mehring come in with a .506 and .484 hitting percentage, respectively.</p>\n<p>If that was not enough to contain for the Gauchos, they will also have to account for AVCA National Player of the Year, junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. This year, the Frenchman has averaged 3.83 kills per set and had a total of 32 kills in seven total sets against the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/","id":5300,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5299,5298,5297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Play in Final Game of the Regular Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 13 UCSB women’s water polo team will head to Matador Pool this Friday to take on No. 14 Cal State Northridge in the final game of its regular season.

The unusual dimensions have been a test for most teams that play there, as CSUN holds a 6-1 record at home in spite of a 20-11 overall record.</p>\n<p>“The pool is a little bit small, so it’s going to be a very physical game for us,” Neushul said. “You will see a lot of challenges to just shoot the ball in.”</p>\n<p>Another obstacle for the Gauchos will be Lindsy Nelson, CSUN’s junior attacker and water polo standout. Nelson leads the Matador attack with 63 goals and 50 assists and has a notable presence defensively with 38 steals and 21 field blocks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will furthermore have to keep an eye on sophomore defender Kelcie Ferreira, who leads Northridge with 73 steals and 37 field blocks.</p>\n<p>“Historically the games in this pool are a little bit lower scoring,” Neushul said. “Again, it will be a physical game and I think we’re going to be up to the challenge of that.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara will face Northridge for the first time this season, the game figures to be a significant final hurdle for the Gauchos in their quest for an NCAA Tournament bid.</p>\n<p>With the implications of Friday’s match heavy for both teams, UCSB will have little reservations heading into the contest.</p>\n<p>“We’re actually feeling pretty good going into this game,” Neushul said. “It’s kind of a do-or-die situation; we just see the end tournament as what really matters.”</p>\n<p>With a win, the Gauchos would secure the fifth seed heading into next weekend’s Big West Championship.

Campaigned as the “3 to See,” Brittany Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins will make an immediate impact on the women’s game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Brittany Griner</span></b></p>\n<p>Griner has become a household name in the basketball world with her 6’8’’ frame. With a wingspan longer than that of Andrew Bynum, Griner brings a presence that the WNBA has never seen before. Yes, there have been taller players than Griner to play in the WNBA, but none that can jump or have the talent of Griner.</p>\n<p>Coming from Baylor University, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind, including Griner’s, that she would be going as the No. 1 pick to the Phoenix Mercury. General Manager and Head Coach Corey Gaines knew as well, even if he tried not to admit it.</p>\n<p>The accolades for Griner are numerous. She set an NCAA record for blocked shots, ranks second on the all-time scoring list, tallied a 50-point performance last season and led the Lady Bears to a perfect, unprecedented 40-0 season in 2011-12. Not to mention, she’s already dunked 18 times. And these are real dunks.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Griner will change the game with her dunking and blocking ability. Heading to Phoenix, there was an initial question of whether she would fit in with the Mercury’s run and gun high-paced offense. However, Griner’s rebounding ability will only jumpstart Phoenix’s break and give them a post presence in the half court set they’ve yet to have.</p>\n<p>Plus, for a team that doesn’t focus on defense, Griner’s blocking ability will only help the Mercury execute its game plan: outscore the opponent.</p>\n<p>For the first time in years, all the attention will not be on Griner. The game will be more physical for her, but she won’t have the constant triple team she’s accustomed to. The reason for that is that Phoenix also happens to feature the No. 1 player in the world — and I’m not talking about Griner.</p>\n<p>Diana Taurasi is back this season after missing last season with a hip flexor injury. She’s the best scorer in the world and can knock down the three-point shot from NBA range, which will allow Griner freedom down low.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to bet on who will win the WNBA championship this early, especially with the defending champion Indiana Fever returning its core group, but it is certain that Phoenix should dominate the Western Conference and be contending for a WNBA championship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Elena Delle Donne</span></b></p>\n<p>After this year’s NCAA Tournament, Delle Donne has become America’s sweetheart in a women’s basketball jersey.</p>\n<p>She boasts a phenomenal story, signing with Connecticut after becoming one of the top high school recruits in the country only to leave overnight during the summer without telling anyone due to homesickness. She wasn’t enjoying basketball anymore and stepped away from the game.</p>\n<p>Thankfully for women’s basketball, Delle Donne did return to basketball, but this time for Delaware, the college close to home.</p>\n<p>Dominating for the Fighting Blue Hens, Delle Donne led her team to the school’s first ever Sweet 16 performance, going in as the underdog and defeating great teams like North Carolina.</p>\n<p>Like Griner, Delle Donne is used to seeing double and triple teams on a nightly basis, but what sets Delle Donne apart is her versatility. Delle Donne is 6’5’’ and can easily body up down low, but she also has a spectacular three-point shot and the ball handling skills of a guard.</p>\n<p>She finished fifth on the all-time NCAA scoring list, finishing with over 3,000 points, which is remarkable considering she missed time on the court during her career due to Lyme Disease.</p>\n<p>She’s a player unlike anybody the women’s game has ever seen before, almost resembling a combination of Lauren Jackson and Diana Taurasi — which says a lot considering those are the best two players in the women’s game today.</p>\n<p>Delle Donne will join the Chicago Sky, a team with potential that has also never made the playoffs. Playing with the great inside presence of Sylvia Fowles and young guards like Courtney Vandersloot and Epiphanny Prince, Delle Donne will fill a large role in the forward position and should mesh well with Swin Cash on the wing.</p>\n<p>Despite the recent media attention that comes with her success, Delle Donne still remains an underrated player after playing at a smaller college. But look out Eastern Conference, she’s ready to play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Skylar Diggins</span></b></p>\n<p>Notre Dame’s all-time leading scorer, Diggins brought the Fighting Irish back into the national spotlight in women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>While she leaves without a national championship, Diggins is the future point guard in the WNBA.</p>\n<p>A solid all-around player, Diggins has great range on her shot, but also can be deceptively quick getting into the lane, showing essences of a Becky Hammon-like guard.</p>\n<p>However, Diggins also gets it done on the defensive end and is known for picking the pocket of her opponents’ point guard, leading to easy layups on the other end.</p>\n<p>As equally important as her play, though, is her leadership. For Notre Dame, Diggins was always the player to get her teammates fired up and has a competitive spirit unmatched by any other rookie this year.</p>\n<p>Selected as the No. 3 draft pick to the Tulsa Shock, Diggins goes to a team that will probably surprise people this season. Tulsa has yet to find success since its days in Detroit and finished last in the Western Conference the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>However, they are a completely different team than last season, and Diggins will fill a role much needed by the Shock. She will facilitate an offense with plenty of talent, playing beside Stanford grads Candice Wiggins, Nicole Powell and Kayla Pedersen. All will be great options for Diggins on the drive and dish, or she can lob the ball down low to the young Australian, Liz Cambage, who, by the way, is also 6’8’’.</p>\n<p>She may be a rookie, but this point guard could lead the Shock to its first successful season. Already beyond her years, this team will belong to Diggins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With all bringing something different to the table, Griner, Delle Donne and Diggins have created a buzz around the WNBA this season.</p>\n<p>The WNBA is continuously improving and showing the capability of women as basketball players. With every year, the league brings in more and more talent, and this rookie class is absolutely no exception.</p>\n<p>For a still very young league, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear int eh print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50929\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50929\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/","id":3184,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3183,3182,3181],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB drops close Contest to Hawaii, Prepares for Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M_Tennis_FilePhoto.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M_Tennis_FilePhoto.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Wednesday, the UCSB men’s tennis team lost an agonizingly close match to the University of Hawaii 4-3 without the help of seniors Mbonisi Ndimande and Benjamin Recknagel.

The Mustangs defeated Hawaii 4-3 on Tuesday and have now amassed an impressive four wins in a row heading into Saturday’s encounter.</p>\n<p>As the last home game of the season, the match against Cal Poly will also be Senior Day and UCSB will bid farewell to Ndimande, Recknagel and Max Glenn.</p>\n<p>The match will begin at 1:00 p.m. in Santa Barbara at the Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus File Photo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-drops-close-contest-to-hawaii-prepares-for-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-drops-close-contest-to-hawaii-prepares-for-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-drops-close-contest-to-hawaii-prepares-for-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-drops-close-contest-to-hawaii-prepares-for-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-drops-close-contest-to-hawaii-prepares-for-cal-poly/","id":222,"author":{"id":291,"name":"Austin Richardson"},"related":[221,220,219],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Series Finale to Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7202.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7202.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team fell to Cal Poly 3-1 on Wednesday in their third and final matchup against its rival this season.

Today was a different story as UCSB continued to struggle putting up runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos took the initial lead in the first inning when senior shortstop Keilani Jennings doubled to center field, bringing home senior centerfielder Jessica Soria.</p>\n<p>A triple by Mustang freshman first baseman Breana West in the bottom of the first brought in junior shortstop Kim Westlund to tie it at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Westlund, the team’s leader in RBI this year, continued to be the big hitter of the Mustang offense when she brought two runners in off a single in the bottom of the fourth. Cal Poly took a 3-1 lead and UCSB was unable to answer back, only getting one hit the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s sophomore pitcher Jordan Yates controlled the Gauchos through all seven innings, giving up just four hits all game.</p>\n<p>Her counterpart on the UCSB side, freshman Alex Pingree, was not able to follow-up her three straight shutout performances with another outstanding effort. Pingree, last week’s Big West Pitcher of the Week winner, gave up three runs off 11 hits in five innings before being replaced by Wisdom.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos go back on the road this weekend for three games against third-place Big West opponent Long Beach State. The 49ers are 28-18 on the season and 9-5 in conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to watch out for Long Beach State’s powerhouse of an offense, which ranks first in the Big West in batting average, with batters hitting at a .290 clip. The 49ers are second in the conference only to No. 20 Hawaii in home runs and runs scored with 37 and 205, respectively, and have three of the top nine slugging percentages.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to be especially wary of the sensational Darian Tautalafua, who leads the entire Big West in RBI this season with 37. The freshman right fielder hits at a .303 clip and a .574 slugging percentage, and is tied for third in the conference with nine home runs.</p>\n<p>Complementing her offensively are junior utility Hannah De Gaetano, sophomore shortstop Shayna Kimbrough and junior catcher Karli Sandoval. De Gaetano is first in the Big West in batting average at .390 while Kimbrough ranks third herself at .373.</p>\n<p>Sandoval is third in the Big West in RBI with 32, and she hits with a .544 slugging percentage herself.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ offense on the other hand has struggled mightily as of late. Though they have won four of their last six games, they have only managed four runs in the last five games.</p>\n<p>“In order to get more hits on the board we just need to find holes,” Wisdom said. “We need to hit the ball hard in the hole.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play LBSU at 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. on Saturday and finish with a noon game on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50926\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-falls-in-series-finale-to-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50926\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-falls-in-series-finale-to-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-falls-in-series-finale-to-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-falls-in-series-finale-to-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/ucsb-falls-in-series-finale-to-cal-poly/","id":994,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[993,992,991],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downed by San Diego on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8021.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8021.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"One game after handing first-place Cal State Fullerton its first loss in league play, the UCSB baseball team fell to the University of San Diego last night 7-5.

Then, with two outs, sophomore Tyler Kuresa drove in the third run of the inning with a double to right field.</p>\n<p>The Toreros would not go quietly, however, and responded in the bottom half of the third. With two outs, senior left fielder Dillon Checkal singled to get aboard in front of USD’s powerhouse junior third baseman Kris Bryant. Bryant promptly drove a two-run home run into left field for the 16th home run this year, bringing San Diego to within one at 3-2.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth inning, San Diego struck again putting up four runs thanks to an RBI single by junior shortstop Logan Davis and a three-run home run by senior catcher Austin Green.</p>\n<p>In the top of the sixth, Kuresa hit a solo home run, his second of the year, to bring the Gauchos back within two. Bryant responded, however, in the bottom of the seventh with another home run, this one a solo shot, to bring his total to 17 on the season. The run was enough to seal the victory for San Diego, despite one last run from Santa Barbara in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Following the loss, UCSB will return home to face off with conference rivals Long Beach State over the weekend. The 49ers are 16-18 this year, but are 6-3 in Big West play, which is good for a three-way tie for second place behind Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is currently riding a four-game win streak heading into Santa Barbara as they have just completed a sweep of UC Davis following a win against San Diego State last Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s sophomore starter Austin Pettibone will look to get the Gauchos on the right track as he will take the mound in game one of Friday. In his last outing, Pettibone held Fullerton to just two runs in seven-and-two-thirds innings. Pettibone leads UCSB with 64.1 innings pitched and his 2.80 ERA is tops among the Gaucho starters.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is the fourth-hardest team to score on in the Big West with a team ERA of 3.96 due in large part to junior pitcher Jake Stassi, who holds a 2.42 ERA in six starts, 10 appearances and holds a 4-1 record this season.</p>\n<p>Game one of the weekend series begins at 3 p.m. Friday afternoon with game two’s first pitch set for 2 p.m. on Saturday and the final game on Sunday slated for a 1 p.m. start time, all at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50892\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50892\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/","id":4670,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4669,4668,4667],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stepping Up When it Matters Most","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"If you thought the only underdogs winning in college were in basketball, think again.

The lone remaining starter of the team that finished as the national runner-up two seasons ago, Davis has led the team not just with his excellent play, but also with his experience that has propelled UCSB into becoming a serious contender.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“With some of the young guys we have on the team, it’s not about me being a hyper-aggressive captain or anything like that,” Davis said. “The best way I can be captain and leader on this team is by playing my best every night and making sure the other guys can have an even mind when we’re playing teams.”</p>\n<p>Davis let his playing do much of the talking this year, finishing the season with 210 kills and ranking first on the team in hitting percentage (.438) and blocks (151). His 437 total blocks throughout his career ranks third all-time in program history. However, what you don’t see is Davis’ significance to the young team inside the locker room.</p>\n<p>“He’s been a great leader; he’s our captain and he’s gotten these guys to push every day in practice and really set their goals, and really work towards them,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “That wasn’t an easy thing to do when we were 3-9 in league and he kept going and kept to the task, and now we’re [11-13] in league and we’re in the playoffs.”</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Davis was thrust onto volleyball’s biggest stage with six seniors starting alongside him and despite losing in the title game against Ohio State, that experience has been invaluable in shaping Davis’ role as team captain this year.</p>\n<p>“Being one of the only guys left on the team that was able to experience [the NCAA Final Four], I realize that I have to bring a kind of leadership to this team and just be the most complete player I possibly can,” Davis said. “And just allow the other players to build off of it [and] gain their own confidence … That’s pretty much been my own goal.”</p>\n<p>Sneaking into the MPSF playoffs as a No. 7 seed in 2011, the Gauchos went on an improbable run, defeating the No. 2, No. 6 and top overall seed USC en route to capturing the conference title and ultimately losing the national title game in five sets. Yet, perhaps no game in that incredible run was more significant to Davis than the national semifinal rematch versus USC.</p>\n<p>On the game’s biggest stage, Davis picked the right occasion for his coming-out party. In the match, Davis recorded 15 kills and a NCAA tournament record .882 hitting percentage, leading his team to the championship game and marking the beginning of Davis’ transition to being the leader he is now for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It gave me confidence in that I could compete with anybody on the other side,” Davis said. “I knew that the way I played was going to be the way I dictated my season and that game — having one of the best games of my career, really taught me I can hang with whomever.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing back in 2011, Davis has used the loss to fuel him to get his current team to where he wants them to be as they prepare to make their first postseason appearance after missing out last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it gives him the desire to get back there and win it,” McLaughlin said. “We had a tough loss back there two years ago and I think that just makes Dylan even hungrier to get this team on the same page so we can get back there and win it.”</p>\n<p>Entering the season with a roster consisting of only three seniors, Davis had the responsibility of leading a very young team through the toughest conference in collegiate volleyball. Yet, the team has responded to Davis’ style of leadership and he has embraced his role of team captain and all the pressures that come along with it.</p>\n<p>“There are guys that look up to you. You have to always be ready to play. You can’t have an off day. You’re going to be the guy that everyone looks up to in the end,” Davis said. “It’s just one of those situations where you have to be confident and be sure of yourself that you’re going to handle that pressure of people expecting so much of you.”</p>\n<p>Now a senior and playing in his final opportunity to win a national championship, Davis understands the potential this team has developed over the course of the season and is confident his team can make a run like they did when he was just a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is starting to click and it couldn’t have come at a better time right now,” Davis said. “I have high hopes for the end of the season and we just got to keep it going … I don’t want it to stop; I don’t want the end to come soon.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB will have to play on the road in the first round of the playoffs against UC Irvine on Saturday, the Gauchos still have a little magic on their side in Davis, and we all know what happened last time he entered the playoffs as an underdog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Daniel Wade of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/","id":5299,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5298,5297,5296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Try to Sweep Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7191.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7191.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team travels back to San Luis Obispo to take on Cal Poly in the third and final game of its season series.
