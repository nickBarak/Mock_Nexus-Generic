The Gauchos shot 867 over the three days, finishing nine shots behind first place UC Davis. Senior Kei Kita and sophomore Paul Otte both finished in the top five, at third and fourth respectively.</p>\n<p>“Paul played a great round of golf yesterday [Monday],” Head Coach Steve Lass said. “I think no bogies during the entire round, the low round of the day and Kei just played really well all three days.”</p>\n<p>Kita shot 72 in the first round on Sunday but followed that with a strong second round, shooting a 69 on Monday, just two strokes behind the leader Otte, who shot a 67 in that round.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I kind of felt like I was in a groove for the first nine holes,” Kita said. “I hit a lot of good shots that day, had a lot of good putts and at the end of the day it turned out to be a 69.So it was good.”</p>\n<p>Kita capped off his tournament with a 71 on Tuesday and led the Gauchos with a total of 212 in the Big West Championship.

Freshman Hunter Robinson tied for No. 26 with a 223.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a bunch of great guys on our team, lots of talent,” Kita said. “In the second round we played a great round of golf. We shot like 500 as a team, so obviously the talent is there, so hopefully we will be able to keep this going. It should be good for the future Gauchos.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46659\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46659\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/","id":1802,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[1801,1800,1799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels South to Face UC Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tied for the No. 3 spot in the Big West, the UCSB baseball team faces No. 5 UC Irvine this weekend in one of the last three league series of the season.

On Sunday we had a million fly balls in the air, we had 13 fly ball outs.”</p>\n<p>Flyball outs are some of the easiest outs to manage in baseball, and have been a training point for Checketts and his staff over the past week. “We’ve been spending the week trying to practice getting the ball up the middle of the field and stay out of the air,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Brett Vertigan has been able to adopt Checketts’ offensive strategies all year, which has translated into spectacular play at the plate. Vertigan currently leads the Big West with a .377 batting average, 44 runs scored and 69 hits. Vertigan also ranks second in slugging percentage (.519) and on-base percentage (.450) behind UCSB sophomore infielder Brandon Trinkwon (.478).</p>\n<p>“[Brett] has been great,”Checketts said. “When he’s on base a bunch we score a lot of runs; when he’s not on base we don’t score a lot of runs. It’s as simple as that.”</p>\n<p>Senior outfielder Lance Roenicke is another Gaucho that has shown dramatic improvement on the offensive end. The Chino Hills native is currently hitting .308, good enough for No. 4 on the team, and also ranks second in the conference with 14 doubles.</p>\n<p>“He’s a career .190 hitter,” Checketts said. “And now he leads the team in doubles and is [second] in the Big West in doubles. He’s always had the talent but now he’s started to put it together.”</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are on a four-game winning streak by a combined run total of 23-9. UC Irvine swept UC Riverside at home last weekend and upset Mountain West opponent San Diego State on the road 6-2 this past week.</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for 6:30 p.m. this evening at Anteater Ballpark on the UC Irvine campus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46669\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-travels-south-face-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46669\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-travels-south-face-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-travels-south-face-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-travels-south-face-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-travels-south-face-uc-irvine/","id":4517,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4516,4515,4514],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season in Fourth Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CedarLay_w-waterpolo_5_Web-feature.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CedarLay_w-waterpolo_5_Web-feature.jpg?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"Over the weekend the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team took fourth place in the 2012 Big West Tournament, held in Davis.

The Gauchos ended the regular season with a 19-13 record overall and a 3-2 record in the Big West, earning them the third seed behind UC Davis and UC Irvine. On Friday, the team opened the tournament against Pacific with a 9-5 win over the Tigers. On Saturday, UCSB lost a heartbreaker in double overtime to the No. 2 seed Davis 7-5 and then dropped another close game 6-5 to Cal State Northridge on Sunday in the third place game.</p>\n<p>“We had a long season with some very well played games, and then we had some games that just did not go the way we planned, but as a team we stuck together,” junior Shelby Haroldson said. “Our seniors are going to be missed very much.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came out strong on Friday when it took the pool for the first time in the tournament. Junior Kacey Creek started the scoring three minutes into the first period and UCSB went on to outscore Pacific 3-0 in the first quarter. The Gauchos didn’t let up the attack when play resumed for the second quarter. Freshman Lauren Martin recorded the first goal of the period, and though Pacific answered with its first goal halfway through the period, the Gauchos found themselves up 6-2 when the whistle blew to end the first half.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Less than two minutes into the third period, the Tigers scored consecutive goals to cut the deficit to two. The Gaucho offense responded as when Martin scored her third goal of the day. Pacific scored to cut into the Gauchos’ lead again, but Creek responded by scoring her second goal to give UCSB an 8-5 lead. In the final period, senior Katie Zakula added one more goal to seal the win as the Gauchos took the match 9-5.</p>\n<p>“I think we were all really pumped and excited to play on Friday and having already recently beaten Pacific helped us come out strong and win the game,” Haroldson said. On Saturday, UCSB found itself facing UC Davis for the fourth time this season. After one half of hard defensive play, the Gauchos trailed 2-1 after being held scoreless in the first period. In the third, the Aggies outscored the Gauchos 3-0 and looked to have the win secured. However, in the final period of regulation, the Gaucho defense clamped down and the offense fired up. Creek scored the first of UCSB’s four goals in the fourth quarter just over a minute into the period, and junior Bryce Winton completed the comeback by scoring with 45 seconds left to force overtime. After the first overtime period, the score was still tied at five apiece, but in the second overtime Davis managed to break the tie and take a 7-5 win.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos faced Cal State Northridge in the third-place game. The first period ended in a 1-1 tie. The two teams headed into halftime with Northridge nursing a 4-3 lead which it promptly lost as the Gauchos outscored the Matadors 2-1 in the third period. The fourth period featured another close battle, before Northridge broke through with just under four minutes to play. Junior Shelby Haroldson put up a shot to tie the game with three seconds left, but it was knocked away as the Gauchos fell 6-5 to the Matadors to take fourth place.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished 20-15 on the season. They will lose just two players to graduation, Zakula and Elle Quane, which will put them in a good position to make a run at the Big West title again next season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-02/ucsb-ends-season-fourth-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-02/ucsb-ends-season-fourth-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-02/ucsb-ends-season-fourth-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-02/ucsb-ends-season-fourth-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-02/ucsb-ends-season-fourth-place/","id":5188,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5187,5186,5185],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps UOP, Falls to St. Mary’s 2-1","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a three-game sweep against Pacific over the weekend, the UCSB baseball team was handed its first loss in five games against St. Mary’s on the road last night.

UOP finishes the weekend at the bottom of the Big West with a 1-8 league record, while the St. Mary’s Gaels improve to 19-19 overall. The Gauchos began the series against Pacific by scraping together a 6-5 victory,due in part to sophomore infielder Brandon Trinkwon’s triple in the ninth that allowed the winning run to cross home plate.

The Tigers are 7-6 at home, and have yet to win a conference series after getting swept by UC Irvine and falling two games to one against UC Davis, both of which series took place away from Pacific. The Tigers have not yet faced a conferenceopponent at their home stadium.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB’s successes thus far this season have come in part from its dominance behind the plate, Checketts’ talented roster of pitchers has also been a handy addition to the UCSB win column. Freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez has had a breakout year through the first months of the season. The Rancho Cucamonga native currently leads the Big West conference in ERA with a 1.66 average.</p>\n<p>“Andrew has a slider that no one can hit,” Checketts said. “Not many freshmen lead their conference in ERA and strikeouts their first year.”</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s game against USC gave the Gauchos another opportunity to test their skills in extended innings. UCSB failed to overcome a Long Beach State squad that played the Gauchos into 14 innings this past weekend, yet were able to rally in the ninth inning on Wednesday for what would be the first win decided in extra innings this year for UCSB.</p>\n<p>In the ninth inning, three straight singles by UCSB opened the frame and gave the Gauchos the opportunity to cut down on the three-run USC lead. After a botched throw to first, senior outfielder Brett Vertigan was able to score safely at home, allowing the Gauchos to cut the lead to one. An RBI by junior Mark Venning scored the tying run.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless extra innings, UCSB was able to put away the game-deciding run on an RBI single by freshman infielder Peter Maris.</p>\n<p>“We were able to hold them down,” Checketts said. “That would have been a gut-buster to lose that one after losing all those close ones [against Long Beach State].”</p>\n<p>First pitch today is set for 6 p.m. at Pacific.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/ucsb-travels-north-face-tigers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/ucsb-travels-north-face-tigers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/ucsb-travels-north-face-tigers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/ucsb-travels-north-face-tigers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/ucsb-travels-north-face-tigers/","id":4514,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4513,4512,4511],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face First Place Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a three-game sweep against UC Riverside last weekend, the UCSB softball team returns to Campus Diamond this weekend to face defending Big West champion and current league leader Pacific.

Junior pitcher Nikki Armagost leads the Big West in batting average (.429) and doubles (16). Senior infielder Nicole Matson rounds out the Tiger offense; her 1.05 RBI per game and 12 home runs rank 26th nationally.</p>\n<p>“I think we are much more prepared and focused in the detail of their team and their lineup,” senior catcher Lainey DePompa said. “Each pitcher is going to have to keep doing what they have been doing, which is working ahead and allowing our defense to play behind them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to contain the high powered offense of the Tigers with freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom. Wisdom garnered Big West Pitcher of the Week honors for her five wins in five games last week, pitching 28 innings and posting a 1.00 ERA; she leads the league in wins (16), innings pitched (190.2) and batters struck out (183).</p>\n<p>“[Wisdom’s] been doing a good job and helping the team as far as getting the popup when needed or even a strikeout,” Galicinao said. “She’s been steady and hitting her spots and doing what she can from the circle.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had its best performance offensively last weekend, scoring 20 combined runs versus UCR, including a season-high 11 runs in the opening game. Along with stellar pitching, Wisdom batted .333 with four RBIs and had four runs against the Highlanders. DePompa has been slugging the ball as of late, leading the team in home runs (5), RBIs (17) and slugging percentage (.400).</p>\n<p>“For me it’s just been taking one pitch at a time,” DePompa said. “Lately I’ve been getting pitches I really like to hit.”</p>\n<p>Last year the Gauchos were swept by Pacific at the Tiger’s ballpark, but will now have the advantage of playing at home where they are 11-5 overall.</p>\n<p>“I think the only way that we’ll lose to them is by beating ourselves up,” sophomore infielder Kathryn Pilpil said. “We know we’re a good team this year and we know we’re capable of sweeping them.”</p>\n<p>First pitch at Campus Diamond is scheduled for 12 p.m. on Saturday,.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46286\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/gauchos-face-place-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46286\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/gauchos-face-place-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/gauchos-face-place-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/gauchos-face-place-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-20/gauchos-face-place-pacific/","id":908,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[907,906,905],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kelsey Adrian: Clutch Canadian","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kenneth-song_womens-basketball-kelsey-adrian-profile-4.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kenneth-song_womens-basketball-kelsey-adrian-profile-4.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"To win a championship, a team needs players who step up in big moments.

Coming off the bench, the senior forward shot 4-6 from behind the arc. In 18 minutes, she tallied 14 points, 38 percent of the Gauchos’ game total. Subsequently, Adrian’s role as a bench player was done.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although her effort wasn’t enough to carry the Gauchos over Washington as the team lost 46-37, Adrian emerged as the team’s premier three-point shooter.</p>\n<p>“When Kelsey can get her feet set, she’s a deadly shooter,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “That [game] showed us that when she gets hot and she shoots with confidence, she’s able to hit any three available to her.”</p>\n<p>Over the course of the season, the Langley, British Columbia native averaged 1.5 threes per game, shooting 36.4 percent from downtown. Not only were both numbers team bests, but they ranked Adrian sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey represented a ‘pro-type’ guard because she’s right at six feet,” Mitchell said. “It was easier for us to get her a shot because she’s got a quick release and because of her size.”</p>\n<p>In 62 games at UCSB after transferring from Cal, Adrian’s name is now found in the record books for total three-pointers. She finished with 100, good enough for seventh all-time.</p>\n<p>“[Kelsey’s] been my go-to player,” Johnson said. “As a point guard, you have to have that shooter, and she was that player for me. I always knew where she was on the court because she’d be ready to knock down the big shot.”</p>\n<p>Another monumental game for Adrian took place on the road against Cal State Northridge, in which UCSB won 71-67 in double overtime, proving that the Gauchos could contend with the best in the league. Prior to the game, Mitchell challenged both seniors to set the tone for their team.</p>\n<p>“What I wanted Kelsey to realize is that she’s not just a shooter,” Mitchell said. “I wanted her to be a scorer. Kelsey needed to find a way to score, whether it be rebound put backs, posting up or getting to free throw line.”</p>\n<p>Adrian responded with 17 points, tying her career high. She shot 7-13 from the field, including 3-6 from three-point land and tallied eight rebounds. Adrian’s stats weren’t just big; she made the big plays too. She hit a critical three that eventually brought the game to overtime and came up with a steal at the end to clinch the game.</p>\n<p>“In that game, I knew I needed to do more for the team for us to win,” Adrian said. “I tried to be more aggressive and I think that showed.”</p>\n<p>A little over a month later, Adrian topped her career-tying offensive performance. Defeating UC Davis on the road 60-56 in a game which gave the team momentum heading into the playoffs, Adrian tallied a career-high 21 points. She shot 7-13 from the field and 4-8 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Since I had been at UCSB, I hadn’t beat Davis,” Adrian said. “I was not going to go out in the last game, last time playing Davis, and [lose].”</p>\n<p>Adrian’s impact wasn’t only on the offensive end. In many games, Adrian defended the opposition’s best shooter. Against Davis, Adrian was given the task of guarding the smaller Hannah Stephens, who scored 16 points, including four threes, in the first matchup. The second time around, Adrian held Stephens to just five points.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey’s length creates a problem [for opponents] and she doesn’t have to guard [them] as close as Emilie or Nicole,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Then, in the playoffs, Adrian made the needed plays. In the second half of the first-round matchup against UC Irvine, a late charge and trey from Adrian helped clinch the 61-51 victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s funny because everyone asks me [if I like taking the big shots,] but during the game, I’m not thinking about it,” Adrian said. “When you’re in the middle of the game, it’s just another shot, which works for me because I’m not thinking about the time and pressure.”</p>\n<p>Then, Adrian hit another crucial three in the championship. After going down 40-41, she put a dagger into Long Beach with a three that gave UCSB a lead with 7:20 remaining, which was never relinquished.</p>\n<p>“Some players shy away from late game [opportunities], but when you put in the time, that’s why you play the game,” Mitchell said. “She has that killer instinct. We wanted somebody taking those shots that has ice in their veins and that’s Kelsey.”</p>\n<p>Adrian tallied just six points in the game, but her impact was felt far beyond the box score.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t even have to score a point,” Mitchell said. “Her steady play and calmness … she’s been there before and everyone fed off of that.”</p>\n<p>In fact, personal stats were never the priority for Adrian. It was always about the team. While her numbers were down this season, averaging 6.6 points this year compared to 9.2 last season the team accomplishments were far superior. For Adrian, a championship was the best way to leave her mark on the Gauchos’ program.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey’s impact goes beyond [the numbers],” Johnson said. “It makes me really happy when she puts up those huge games on the stat sheet, but she doesn’t care whether she has two points or 20. For her, all that matters is the win.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/","id":714,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[713,712,711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Home Within a Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AnnieHall_mvballvUCSD_3.09.12-333.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AnnieHall_mvballvUCSD_3.09.12-333.jpg?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"Growing up in Goleta since birth, Miles Evans always envisioned himself one day attending UCSB and starring as a major athlete on campus.

The junior outside hitter just never imagined that his sport would be volleyball. The hometown hero’s path to UCSB, while somewhat expected, certainly took some interesting turns along the way.Evans was a natural-born athlete, participating in all sports growing up with a special eye toward playing collegiately at UCSB. Volleyball, however, had not even crossed his mind when it came to athletics. It was not until his sophomore year at Dos Pueblos High School that he tried his hand at the sport.</p>\n<p>“I was bad at volleyball my first two years playing, and then something clicked where I really enjoyed playing and wanted to get better,” Evans said. “I practiced every day just for fun.”</p>\n<p>Encouraged by his former junior high physical education coach Chris Hughes, also the volleyball coach at Dos Pueblos High, Evans conceited to give it a shot, a decision that proved beneficial for both him and the community of Santa Barbara.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It took Miles about a half year to get hooked, and that’s all he wanted to do: play volleyball,” Hughes said. “As a coach, it makes me really proud. Miles never played volleyball until his sophomore year and look at him now.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Evans improved enough to play club ball his senior year in 2007, even garnering attention from college programs interested in recruiting him to play Division I volleyball.</p>\n<p>“I got recruited by Hawaii, Northridge and UCSB out of high school,” Evans said. “But I didn’t take my SATs because I didn’t know I was that good at volleyball, or I didn’t know I was going to be.”</p>\n<p>Unable to register at any of the colleges that recruited him, Evans enrolled at SBCC to begin his pursuit of a newfound dream of playing collegiate volleyball at UCSB. After redshirting one year in 2008, Evans finally tried to show he could handle his own at the junior college level.</p>\n<p>Things did not go according to plan. After a mere two games, Evans was kicked off the team at SBCC by the coach – not for lack of talent, but for personal reasons.“I was actually one of the better players on the team, and I got cut because I had a huge ego,” Evans said. “I was like the virus on the team because I was thinking I was so good, so the coach cut me.” With one year of eligibility wasted, Evans came back and went on to play the next season under the same coach at SBCC, where he led the state in kills. While continually receiving interest from local universities, he still did not have the grades to make it into a four-year university.</p>\n<p>That’s when Evans redshirted at UCSB to improve his grades and qualify academically. In his spare time, he was able to practice with the team and eventually gained admission before the 2011-2012 school year. “He is hungry for this sport,” UCSB Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Miles is hungry, he hasn’t experienced a lot of this stuff and he’s done a great job for us this year. I even expect him next year to be one of the best guys in the league.” Evans led the Gauchos this year with a team-high 325 kills and ranked No. 11 in league in kills per set with nearly 3.5 per and 14th in digs. Five years after graduating high school, the rest of Santa Barbara has finally been able to see the type of player Evans can be – a player that several coaches envisioned so long ago.</p>\n<p>“He has a ton of potential and he has the ability to play this game beyond college, whether it’s professional or with our national team,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>A leader on the floor with his play, Evans always draws a crowd in home matches with his own cheering section usually accompanying him and waiting to greet him after the games.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing; it’s a great experience because the community really enjoys me playing for UCSB,” Evans said. “There are a lot of friends that get to watch the matches. I love being a part of the community and representing Santa Barbara, it’s really awesome to play for UCSB, it’s always been a dream of mine.”</p>\n<p>Although finally a student at UCSB, Evans by no means has a normal college life, still living at home in Goleta with his family to save money and focus more on schoolwork. Coming from a family in which he is the youngest of five, including two half-sisters, a half-brother and a stepsister, Evans has managed to balance college life with the everyday distractions that come with living at home.</p>\n<p>“I think it has been benefiting me in many ways because I don’t have to deal with the whole I.V. scene and the whole party scene,” Evans said. “I would love to move out here next year, but at the same time, it’s more realistic to stay at home and stay more focused on my studies rather than having fun.”</p>\n<p>Focused on pursuing a career in volleyball, Evans, a sociology major, hopes to one day go back to school for a master’s degree when his days of volleyball are over. Dreams of a professional career seem to be a possibility, with a hint at the Olympics as the ultimate goal for Evans.</p>\n<p>“This is my dream,” Evans said. “I’ve always wanted to be where I’m at right now. Now I just need to set higher and higher goals, and see where volleyball can take me.”</p>\n<p>Volleyball, once an afterthought to Miles Evans, has become a way of life, providing him with the opportunity to chase his dreams and receive a higher education.</p>\n<p>“I honestly don’t know what I would have done if I didn’t get into volleyball,” Evans said. “I could say that without volleyball, I couldn’t get through college, to tell you the truth.”</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Evans are surely grateful for the switch to volleyball and all of the opportunities that may come next season in what looks to be a promising senior year for Miles Evans and the rest of Gaucho squad.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/","id":5407,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5406,5405,5404],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to USC for Evening Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a disappointing series at Long Beach State over the weekend, the UCSB baseball team will once again travel south in the hopes of snapping a three-game losing streak this evening against USC.

The Trojans’ senior infielder Matt Foat leads the team in batting with a .381 average and a .500 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a number of possibilities to combat Foat and the USC offense on the mound, one being freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez. Vasquez currently holds a 1.66 ERA through nine appearances, all of which have been starting efforts. As arguably the team’s best freshman pitcher, Vasquez continues to impress his upperclassmen teammates.</p>\n<p>“He’s great,” Vertigan said. “In the fall he was just an average lefty, and [now] he’s developed a slider that’s pretty much impossible to hit. He’s gonna be great for this program in the next couple of years.”</p>\n<p>A deep pitching staff will give Head Coach Andrew Checketts other options as well, including freshman righthander Austin Pettibone and senior lefthander Zack Edgington, among others. Pettibone currently holds a 4.78 ERA through 10 games, while Edgington has thrown with a 3.16 ERA through 13 games.</p>\n<p>USC has proven to be a dangerous opponent for Big West Conference teams throughout the season. The Trojans beat Long Beach State 4-2 on the road in late February, and also controlled a 5-4 win on the road at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stand tied for No. 4 alongside UC Irvine in the Big West rankings with a 4-5 league record and a 17-17 overall effort this season. UCSB will look to break that .500 mark today against USC at Dedeaux Field on the Trojan campus.</p>\n<p>“We need to get them early in the first inning,” Vertigan said. “We need to start off by scoring a few runs and setting them back on their heels.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/gauchos-travel-usc-evening-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/gauchos-travel-usc-evening-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/gauchos-travel-usc-evening-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/gauchos-travel-usc-evening-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/gauchos-travel-usc-evening-game/","id":4516,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4515,4514,4513],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Three Games at Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team finished the weekend on the wrong side of a three-game sweep against Long Beach State.

The 49ers improve to 16-17 overall and 7-2 in league play.</p>\n<p>The weekend began late for both teams, as thunderstorms and heavy rains postponed Friday’s series opener until Saturday. However, the postponed game did not help UCSB’s play on Saturday, as the Gauchos were outscored 6-3 through eight and a half innings. After taking a 2-0 lead through four innings, UCSB gave up four runs on four hits in the sixth inning. Two more runs in the seventh inning secured the win for CSULB, which held the Gauchos to just one more score in the eighth.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday’s second game just a few hours later offered UCSB multiple chances to tie the series. The Gauchos took the 49ers into five extra innings, and even held a two-run lead in the 12th, before falling in the 14th inning 5-4. Junior outfielder Brett Vertigan had two hits on six at-bats for the Gauchos, and UCSB was out-hit 12-5 on the evening. Starting freshman righthander Austin Pettibone played well through just over six innings, giving up just five hits and two runs throughout. Senior righthander Matt Vedo replaced Pettibone on the mound for just over three innings, in which he gave up no runs on five total hits. Freshman lefthander Greg Mahle closed the game for the Gauchos in the final three innings, where he gave up three runs on only two hits by the 49ers.</p>\n<p>The series finale on Sunday offered UCSB its best chance to pull out a win on the weekend. With two outs in the ninth inning and the tying run at third base, a ground ball by senior outfielder Lance Roenicke was corralled by the Long Beach third baseman, who easily made the toss to second and erased any hopes of a UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>Senior lefthander Zak Edgington was granted the start in Sunday’s game and allowed three earned runs in just over five pitched innings. However, Edgington’s most noticeable stat on the day was his five struck-out batters, which marked his career high. UCSB’s pitching staff allowed just seven hits on the day for CSULB, whose own play at the mound contained the Gaucho offense to just eight total hits.</p>\n<p>UCSB will stay on the road during its next five games, beginning with an evening nonconference game on Wednesday at USC. UCSB will then travel south again next weekend for a three-game Big West series against Cal State Northridge before venturing north to take on Saint Mary’s next Monday, April 23.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46142\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/gauchos-drop-games-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46142\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/gauchos-drop-games-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/gauchos-drop-games-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/gauchos-drop-games-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/gauchos-drop-games-long-beach/","id":4512,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4511,4510,4509],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Finishes Season With Weekend Losses","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the road for the final two regular season games of the year, the UCSB men’s volleyball team dropped a pair of tough matches, eliminating the Gauchos from the playoffs.

Northridge clinched the eighth and final playoff spot with a victory over Pepperdine on Thursday night to officially eliminate the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“To miss the playoffs is a terrible feeling, especially to a team like Northridge that we played three times and we beat them twice, and there they are in the playoffs,” Donohue said. “Only a couple games that we lost this year kept us out of the playoffs. We need to learn from that.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s loss to Pacific was a heartbreaking one for the Gauchos as they squandered a 2-0 lead to lose in five sets. Donohue posted a career-high 22 kills in the defeat, matching a Gaucho season high set by junior middle blocker Dylan Davis on Feb. 29 against Northridge.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely my best match of the year,” Donohue said. “[Junior setter] Oliver [Deutschman] was putting the ball in a perfect position for me to hit, and we found a rhythm together.”</p>\n<p>No. 13 Pacific improved to 8-20 overall (5-17 MPSF) with the victory coming after a 3-1 loss to No. 3 UCLA on Friday night. The Gauchos overpowered Pacific in the first two sets by scores of 25-20 and 26-24 before dropping three straight: 18-25, 23-25 and 12-15.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Miles Evans recorded 17 kills while senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen added a career-high 13 to go along with 16 digs in his final match as a Gaucho. Deutschman’s 60 assists — a personal season high — were the most posted by a Gaucho this season.</p>\n<p>“[Saturday] night we came out, and we were on fire the first two games and basically found a rhythm,” Donohue said. “It was kind of a tough loss there, but we kept our heads high. I think these five-game matches where we were up 2-0, we’re going to learn from these losses that we had.”</p>\n<p>Friday night’s match at No. 5 Stanford resulted in a sweep for the Cardinal by a mark of 25-19, 25-14, 25-20. Stanford tied for second in the MPSF with a 17-5 conference record (20-6 overall) and will be the number two seed in the conference tournament next weekend.</p>\n<p>Senior outside hitter Brad Lawson led the Cardinal in kills with 16, while sophomore outside hitter Steven Irvin added 14.</p>\n<p>Donohue led the Gauchos in kills once again Friday, recording 10 in addition to a team-high five digs. Evans added eight kills and four digs for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re going to be motivated to come out next year,” Donohue said. “It’s going to be fun, we have a lot of returners.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46147\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/ucsb-finishes-season-weekend-losses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46147\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/ucsb-finishes-season-weekend-losses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/ucsb-finishes-season-weekend-losses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/ucsb-finishes-season-weekend-losses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-16/ucsb-finishes-season-weekend-losses/","id":5406,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5405,5404,5403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Victorious on Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Senior Day for the UCSB women’s tennis team, the whole team dominated en route to a 7-0 win over UC Riverside after defeating Cal State Fullerton 6-1 on Saturday in Fullerton.

Novak won 6-3, 6-2; Lozano won 6-0, 6-2; and Dockendorf won 6-2, 6-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s a good day, and it’s sad, but it hasn’t really hit me yet,” Dockendorf said. “To win 7-0 is a big confidence boost; it’ll set us up for better seeding.”</p>\n<p>Sophomores Paola Cos and Casey Reede also won in just two sets. The Highlanders came closest to earning a point in the match with freshman April Scatliffe, but she ultimately clinched the sweep for UCSB with a 6-4, 5-7 (10-4) win.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good feeling to end on a good note,” Novak said. “Big West is gonna be different because of the conditions out there; it’s tough, it’s the desert. But everybody’s in tip-top shape, which is what we need to be out there all day.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos’ 6-1 win at Fullerton dropped the Titans to 6-10 (0-5). UCSB won No. 2 and 3 doubles to claim the first point and then won all the singles matches except No. 1. Reede was inserted into the singles lineup for an injured Kiersten Meehan and swept court No. 6 by a mark of 6-1, 6-3.

A loss will end the Gauchos’ hopes for a postseason berth, as they need both victories this weekend along with a loss from UCSD and two from Northridge.</p>\n<p>“Winning these two matches [against Hawaii] will definitely give us more confidence going into the next games,” junior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “I feel like we’re really going to play our best for these next two matches and show, just like we did here that we can play volleyball.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos sit at 7-17 overall with a 5-15 mark in the MPSF, while Stanford is battling for home court advantage in the conference tournament with a 15-5 record in the MPSF (18-6 overall). The Cardinal currently is tied for fourth in the standings, but still hold an outside chance of locking up a number one seed.</p>\n<p>Last weekend’s two victories snapped an eight game losing skid for the Gauchos, wins they hope will carry momentum heading up north this weekend.</p>\n<p>“It’s huge, we had a long time there without a win,” McLaughlin said. “Anytime you can get a back-to-back win, yet alone one win, our confidence is better. ”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match against Pacific will be a source of redemption for the Gauchos, as UCSB previously fell 3-1 when hosting Pacific, a game which they felt they should have won.</p>\n<p>“Pacific beat us up down here early in the season, and our guys are hungry for that match,” McLaughlin said. “We didn’t play well, and they can’t wait to get to that match.”</p>\n<p>No. 13 Pacific stands at 7-19 on the season, and with a 4-16 mark in the MPSF have already been eliminated from postseason play. The Tigers have lost five matches in a row, a mark likely to be extended to six on Friday night when they host No. 3 UCLA.</p>\n<p>Winning two straight on the road might be difficult for the Gauchos, as the team is 2-7 all year in opponents’ home gymnasiums.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like it’s going to be any different than playing here,” Evans said. “I just feel like we’re going to have to play as a team, really keep up our team chemistry, and stay loose, aggressive and confident.”</p>\n<p>Evans led the Gauchos in kills for both matches against Hawaii last weekend, registering a career-high 21 on Saturday. Blocking meanwhile also seemed to be a strong point for UCSB as junior middle blocker Dylan Davis dominated, tallying a combined 19 blocks in the two matches.</p>\n<p>“Blocking is crucial for the next two matches,” Evans said.” It really helped [last week], so if we can do the same, we can really get some good results next time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ lone senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen will be playing in his final two matches this weekend if UCSB fails to qualify for the playoffs. N</p>\n<p>“Finally we have some good momentum,” Nielsen said after Saturday’s win over Hawaii. “The best thing about this is these hard practices where we’ve been grinding … it’s finally paying off.”</p>\n<p>Matches on Friday and Saturday night both start at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion at Stanford and the Alex G.

These are also UCSB’s final two conference games, and so will play a large role in determining their seeding in the tournament.</p>\n<p>“Getting at least one win this weekend puts us in a really good position for the Big West Tournament,” junior attacker Shelby Haroldson said. “By winning both games this weekend we will be seeded second in the tournament and have a bye on Friday.”</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos take to the pool at noon on Saturday, it will be the third time this season that they find UC Davis waiting for them at the other end. In their first matchup of the season, UCSB’s third game overall, the Aggies outfought the Gauchos to hand them a 12-8 defeat. Junior goalkeeper Ruth Milne recorded eight saves and freshman attacker Bernadette Bevins found the Aggie net three times but UCSB could not stand up to the Davis assault.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Their second meeting, during the UC Irvine Invitational, ended very differently. A 3-1 second quarter and 12 saves by Milne kept the Gauchos in front long enough to sneak away with a 10-9 win. This time it was Haroldson and sophomore utility Molly Hafferkamp who lead the team in scoring with three goals each.</p>\n<p>“We definitely know most of [Davis’] plays and which players we need to be careful of, but the last time we played them was in February and things could be different since then, so we are just going into the game like we go into any game, giving it our all and coming out with a lot of intensity,” Haroldson said.</p>\n<p>Yet neither of the previous games mattered like the third one does. The first two didn’t count toward either team’s conference record. Both teams will be looking to bring their best. Fortunately for the Gauchos, they have shown steady improvement over the course of the season and are playing some of their best water polo right now, as they have won eight of their last 10 games.</p>\n<p>“We are a completely different team since the very first time we saw Davis,” Haroldson said.</p>\n<p>The next day the Gauchos will once again find themselves in the pool at noon, this time to face Pacific. The Tigers opened their season by winning eight of their first 10, but have tailed off in recent weeks. They have won only three games since then, and are currently riding an eight-game losing streak. They have lost 11 of their last 12 games and stand at 9-15 on the season and 0-3 in conference.</p>\n<p>However, a conference win over the Gauchos would mean a lot to Pacific, and they will likely throw everything they have against UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We definitely aren’t going into that game thinking it’s going to be an easy win because with any team and every game you play you never know what the outcome is going to be,” Haroldson said.</p>\n<p>Both of the weekend’s matches are slated for noon start times, against Davis on Saturday and Pacific on Sunday. After this weekend, UCSB will have almost two weeks to get ready before they return to Davis, where the Big West Tournament is being hosted this year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/15-gauchos-travel-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/15-gauchos-travel-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/15-gauchos-travel-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/15-gauchos-travel-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/15-gauchos-travel-davis/","id":5184,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5183,5182,5181],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":170,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
