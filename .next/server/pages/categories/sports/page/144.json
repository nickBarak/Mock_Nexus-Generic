As a Los Angeles Lakers diehard fan, I don’t remember a year where my enthusiasm for the impending NBA season was so low. Nevertheless, basketball is a sport I love and will always love, so I will watch, I will enjoy and I will feel some sense of satisfaction when my predictions for the 2013-2014 season come true.</p>\n<p><strong>LeBron James will win his fifth MVP award and the Miami Heat will repeat (again)</strong></p>\n<p>Told you these predictions wouldn’t be surprising. LeBron has firmly established his place as one of the greatest NBA players of all time, and he’s still in his prime at the age of 28. The only wings you could throw in the same sentence would be Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. And even that’s an unfair comparison to James since he plays all five positions as well as anyone in history, including Magic Johnson. Nothing short of a devastating injury or Kevin Durant scoring 50 points a game will knock the King off his throne.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>The Los Angeles Lakers will miss the playoffs for the third time since 1976</strong></p>\n<p>This pains me to write, but even the most loyal Lakers fans see the writing on the wall. Last season’s seventh place finish was a complete disaster, and the team has been blown up with no significant improvements in the offseason. Dwight Howard abandoned ship after failing to live up to the hype while recovering from surgery. Now the hopes of the Lakers rest in the hands of Canada’s founding father Steve Nash, a pair of seven-foot cavemen [age and facial hair considered] in Pau Gasol and Chris Kaman, and a trigger happy journeyman wing referred to as “Swaggy P.” Shooting guard Nick Young fills the void left by Kobe Bryant and figures to be the Lakers’ leading scorer as long as Kobe is rehabbing. Of course, Kobe is the toughest athlete in the nation and could surprise everyone with an early triumphant return, and Pau is aging gracefully as a still effective starter. But the stars are aligned for the team in red that plays at Staples Center this year.</p>\n<p><strong>The 76ers will “win” the “waste for Wiggins” race</strong></p>\n<p>With the balance of power in the NBA extremely top-heavy for the last decade, teams realize that being awful and throwing a season in the hopes of landing the top pick in the draft is more advisable than dwelling in mediocrity for years and years. Just ask the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors and Portland Trail Blazers, among others. The 76ers could be historically bad, with the Andrew Bynum experiment ending in failure and their best player Jrue Holiday being traded for a first round pick with a torn ACL. Nerlens Noel is out for the season, leaving Evan Turner as the only solid starter on the entire roster. Spencer Hawes has shown flashes of being a very productive player, but the team will still be awful even with those two playing their best basketball.</p>\n<p>We could see some great stories this season. The Cavaliers could return to contention, the Pacers will be better this year, and the return of Derrick Rose to the Bulls could give the Heat a run for their money. But at the top of the hierarchy, the song remains the same. Cheers to classic rock references.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The Possibility of a Three-peat in Miami</p>\n<p>Most people didn’t think Miami could win one championship, but the Heat are now back-to-back champions. But can they do it again? If they could, they would cement themselves as one of the dynasties in NBA history, as only the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls have ever won three straight titles.</p>\n<p>However, before Miami can think about the legacy they could create, they have to endure 82 games and get to the NBA finals for the fourth straight year, which will be tougher than ever with an incredibly competitive Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Heat, they happen to have the two-time reigning MVP in LeBron James, who has gotten better every year. The key for Miami this year will be staying healthy. Its players have logged a lot of minutes in the last three years with three finals trips. If they lose key pieces to injury, the three-peat will be a no-go. But with last year’s roster basically intact, if they can stay healthy, you never know. We may be watching history in the making.</p>\n<p>The Hype in Brooklyn</p>\n<p>On paper, Brooklyn has to have one of the best teams in the league, and possibly the best team in the Nets’ history.</p>\n<p>That roster begins with point guard Deron Williams, one of the best in the league. He’ll have a stacked roster to work with options such as Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Brook Lopez. They also brought in defensive stopper Andrei Kirilenko and shooter Jason Terry. Basically, Brooklyn looks set in every position, but what’s unknown is whether they can come together as a team.</p>\n<p>Several of these players are reaching the end of their careers, so the challenge for freshly retired and new Head Coach Jason Kidd will not only be to make this team mesh, but to find chemistry in a hurry.</p>\n<p>The Lakers’ Injury Status</p>\n<p>Despite the star power in L.A. last season, the Lakers never came together, particularly because of injuries. This season, there is one injury in particular that will matter most: Kobe Bryant’s.</p>\n<p>This team lives and dies right now on the play of Bryant. Nevertheless, this hard-working, determined superstar needs to be careful not to come back too soon. He’s no longer 25 and is showing signs of slowing down. As badly as he wants to be on the court, he needs to stay healthy if the Lakers want a shot at making the playoffs, because without him, they won’t.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with Bryant, the Lakers will always be dangerous. His scoring ability can bring in a win any night of the week.</p>\n<p>A New Era in Sacramento</p>\n<p>The Sacramento Kings have finally finalized where they’ll be playing for a long time: Sacramento. Now that they can actually focus on basketball, it’ll be about rebuilding in the Capital City.</p>\n<p>The Kings just announced the contract extension of DeMarcus Cousins and have decent depth at the point guard spot between Isaiah Thomas and Greivis Vasquez.</p>\n<p>With new ownership working on a new arena and increasing ticket sales and sponsorship, Sacramento is moving in the right direction. They’re certainly not championship material yet, and may not even be playoff contenders, but the improvement by the Kings should be tangible.</p>\n<p>Howard in Houston</p>\n<p>The question right now with Dwight Howard is whether he can find a team he can be happy with. With Orlando, he wasn’t winning, but he was the star. With L.A., he wasn’t the focus and that was a problem. Nothing’s been right so far. So, Howard is once again starting over, this time in Houston.</p>\n<p>Howard brings a much-needed inside presence, as well as a defensive edge, to a Rockets team that has one great scorer in James Harden and a great distributor in Jeremy Lin.</p>\n<p>With his height, wingspan and athletic ability, Howard should be a premier center this year and should turn the Rockets into a playoff contender. But with Howard’s track record, that is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52563\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52563\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/","id":3237,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3236,3235,3234],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ready to Clinch Playoff Spot Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-9.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-9.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"preview of UCSB men's soccer vs. Sac State","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When things have looked bleak for the UCSB men’s soccer team, players have stepped up late in games en route to the Gauchos claiming six straight victories.

We can’t afford to slip up right now,” freshman midfielder Drew Murphy said. “If we can make it 6-0 on Tuesday night, then that puts us in a very good situation for the rest of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB enters today’s match coming off a thrilling 3-2 double overtime victory over UC Davis, the Gauchos third straight overtime road victory. Murphy garnered a goal and the game-winning assist, earning him Big West Offensive Player of the Week honors. This is the third straight week a Gaucho has taken home a player of the week award with senior defender Peter Schmetz and freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely taking home Defensive Player of the Week honors the previous two weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited to play at home and hopefully we show up with a lot of energy,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’d be great to put a couple of balls away early and give ourselves a little bit of breathing room in the game.”</p>\n<p>Despite the string of victories, there is worry amongst the UCSB coaching staff about the emotional toll all of these comeback wins could have on the team.</p>\n<p>“We’ve just been on this emotional roller coaster, that at some point, might crash,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s a bigger concern; I don’t think we’ll overlook Sac State.”</p>\n<p>Sacramento State enters as the only winless team in conference play and has been outscored 10-2 during the team’s five-game losing skid. The Hornets rank last in the conference with a mere seven goals scored in 13 matches this season, while ranking second-to-last with 21 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>However, senior goalkeeper Cesar Castillo ranks first in the conference with a .789 save percentage, despite allowing 1.5 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Already up three games in the Big West North Division, UCSB inches closer to clinching a conference tournament birth already, with five matches still remaining on the schedule.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking to get the three points and to get a lead in conference,” senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “That will allow the coaches to rest some of the guys that have played a lot of minutes so we can all be fresh and ready to go for the conference tournament.”</p>\n<p>Currently at the halfway point of conference play, a victory today would ensure the Gauchos finish above .500 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s match is scheduled for a 7 p.m. kickoff time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52564\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/ucsb-ready-to-clinch-playoff-spot-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52564\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/ucsb-ready-to-clinch-playoff-spot-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/ucsb-ready-to-clinch-playoff-spot-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/ucsb-ready-to-clinch-playoff-spot-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/ucsb-ready-to-clinch-playoff-spot-tonight/","id":1259,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1258,1257,1256],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Extend Winning Streak to Six","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-30.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-30.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats UC Davis 3-2 in double overtime","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the third straight game, the UCSB men’s soccer team came from behind to capture an overtime victory, this time defeating UC Davis on the road 3-2 in double overtime.

Junior forward Matt Wiesenfarth headed home a goal in the 57th minute, while senior midfielder Alex Aguiar added a 78th minute goal to give Davis its first lead late in the game.</p>\n<p>“We knew Davis was going to be tough and we were more concerned with defending than attacking,” Baiden said. “We could have had more shots on goal, but at the end of the day, we’re happy to get the three points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB then added late game pressure as they have done in the previous two games to try and score before time ran out. The pressure finally paid off minutes before the end of the match, as UCSB was awarded a penalty kick due to a foul in the box.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Achille Campion sent the penalty kick between the posts for a 90th minute goal, tying the game and sending UCSB to overtime moments later.</p>\n<p>After an uneventful first overtime period, UCSB finally came through in the second, avoiding its first draw of the season. Murphy sent a corner kick near the back post, allowing Boyoko to head in the game-winning goal for his fifth goal and fourth game-winner of the season. For Murphy, it was his seventh assist on the season, tied for first in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“The coaches give me a general area of where to serve the ball and I’m glad Goffin was there,” Murphy said. “We get a lot of chances off corners, and a lot of it has to do with luck, but Goffin was in the right spot at the right time and he got the game winner with 50 seconds left. It couldn’t have happened at a better time.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos finished the match with three shots on goal, all of which were successful, and seven shots in total. Davis finished with 11 shots and four shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the opportunities, UCSB holds a large lead in the Big West standings with only five games remaining on the season. The Gauchos have now won their first five conference games for just the second time in program history.</p>\n<p>“We’re 14 games in now and things are finally starting to click,” Murphy said. “A lot of that has to come off the fact that we’ve been winning. A soon as everything starts to go well, things tend to click with teams and I think we’re at that point right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Sacramento State at Harder Stadium Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/gauchos-extend-winning-streak-to-six/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/gauchos-extend-winning-streak-to-six/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/gauchos-extend-winning-streak-to-six/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/gauchos-extend-winning-streak-to-six/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/gauchos-extend-winning-streak-to-six/","id":1578,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1577,1576,1575],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes Down Top Big West Team Again","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_03.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_03.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Northridge 3-1, UC Davis 3-2 at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Riding the momentum of a three match winning streak, the UCSB women’s volleyball team continued its hot run this past weekend with a pair of wins over Cal State Northridge and UC Davis.</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive weekend, UCSB defeated the top team in the Big West, dropping Northridge to 16-4 overall and 6-1 in conference.

However, despite winning the set by a score of 25-20, the Gauchos allowed the Aggies to go on a run of their own and gain momentum going into the next two sets.</p>\n<p>Momentum in hand, UC Davis used strong blocking to keep up with UCSB in the second game. Trailing 17-18, the Aggies went on an 8-2 run to win the set 25-20. The next set got even worse for the Gauchos as Davis took advantage of numerous UCSB errors, and therefore took a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Needing a comeback, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch made a crucial change by moving Sully from libero back to her favored position at outside hitter. The result was only positive for UCSB as Sully, who was already well on her way to a season high 25 digs, turned the game around with nine kills in the final two sets on an incredible .643 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>“We were a little bit out of sorts; I felt like we needed a change and it was a gamble,” Lantagne Welch said. “[We] just jumped on it and it gave us a ton of momentum.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stole momentum back from Davis in the fourth set, winning 25-20 to even the match. Entering the fifth set, UCSB finished off the Aggies 15-11, capped off by another winner by Sully.</p>\n<p>Making a big difference for UCSB was Barbeau, who ended the game with 19 kills and six digs. Thompson and freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt led the defense with nine and eight blocks, respectively.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s match against Northridge, the Gauchos came in confident after defeating No. 10 Hawaii just a week earlier.</p>\n<p>UCSB made quick work of CSUN, using a balanced offensive attack to win the first two sets 25-22 and 25-19. The Gauchos then finished off the Matadors 25-15 for a 3-0 sweep.</p>\n<p>“It’s extremely rewarding because it’s tough to play a match after you have such a big emotional win like [Hawaii],” Lantagne Welch said. “For us to come in so prepared and really take it to a team that’s been very hot, I’m very proud of the team for that.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt led the way with 12 kills and nine digs. She also hit at an impressive .375 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>Next weekend, UCSB heads to UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/","id":5276,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5275,5274,5273],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Matchups","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_07.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_07.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats UC Riverside 1-0 in OT, falls to Fullerton 1-0","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite earning its biggest win of the season this Friday at home against UC Riverside in a 1-0 overtime thriller, the UCSB women’s soccer team was unable to duplicate the same result Sunday against Cal State Fullerton, losing 1-0 on the road.</p>\n<p>Through three weeks of conference play, the Gauchos continue their pattern of splitting their weekend matches and are now 9-7-1 overall and 3-3 in the Big West.

Yet, the Titans were the clear aggressors in the half, outshooting Santa Barbara 10-1 in the half.</p>\n<p>UCSB kept its defensive pressure in the second half and the game had every indication of going into overtime. However, with two minutes left, CSUF had a corner kick and took advantage of a failed clearance, scoring on the rebound to seal the win. It was UCSB’s third conference loss by one goal.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately for us the ball just fell to one of their players about three or four yards out; [Fullerton] just snuck in the second chance,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite being outshot 18-4, including 12-1 in shots on goal, sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter had a phenomenal night, tallying a career-high 10 saves.</p>\n<p>Friday night’s game against Riverside, nothing short of physical and tough, had both teams in a defensive gridlock from beginning to end. Each side traded possession of the ball in the first half and the Gauchos limited UCR to only two shots.</p>\n<p>With time expiring in regulation, the Gauchos showed no sign of fatigue and sent the game to overtime, their first of the season.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we’ve talked about is their mentality and they’ve proved over the last two games in a row that there mentality is very good,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite fatigue setting in, UCSB was quick to attack the opposition’s side of the goal in overtime, having four shots in five minutes before freshman midfielder McKinsey Martinez scored the game-winning golden goal. Martinez capitalized on an open shot inside the penalty box.</p>\n<p>“[The ball] was fumbling around, got hit a couple times and off defenders, just bounced out to my right foot and I volleyed it in,” Martinez said. “…This is my first game ever playing; it feels awesome being able to know that it’s finally my time.”</p>\n<p>At that point, Ritter continued adding to her impressive shutout streak. All of UCSB’s wins this year had come by way of shutout, eight of those with Ritter guarding the posts.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now prepares for its final two games of the regular season where it will need to produce results to earn a spot in the Big West Tournament. The first game of the weekend against Cal Poly at home is scheduled for Friday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52551\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52551\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/","id":1562,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1561,1560,1559],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Pepperdine, Falls to Cal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WaterPolo4_KevinYang_10.05.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WaterPolo4_KevinYang_10.05.2013.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB splits its first MPSF games","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fresh off a sixth place finish in the SoCal tournament, the No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team competed in its first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation games this weekend, splitting its matches.

California attackers, junior Aleska Saponjic and redshirt freshman Farrel South, put up two early goals. Sophomore Mitchell Hamilton followed suit, notching two late goals of his own for the Golden Bears. UCSB’s leading scorer Senior Matt Gronow kept the game close however, with a pair of goals in the second quarter to keep the score at a manageable 5-3.</p>\n<p>In the second half, California’s offense began to stand out. They effectively ran the break and scored on a multitude of counter attacks.  Though UCSB was able to pull within one with about three minutes left in the third quarter, California’s balanced scoring stifled any hopes of a comeback.</p>\n<p>“This game started off with great defense,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We gave up a few too many counter goals for us to be in the game and that’s unfortunate because we did a lot of good things.”</p>\n<p>Gronow led the attack for UCSB, striking for four goals in the game to add to his total of 42 on the season. Defensively, sophomore goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge totaled seven saves on the day.</p>\n<p>“The thing that helped me out was that I caught the defense in a little bit of a lapse,” Gronow said. “The majority of the time they weren’t really expecting it and I think that’s the best time to capitalize.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game against Pepperdine gave the Gauchos a much needed opening win before Sunday’s match. The score was kept close through the first two quarters of play, as the Gauchos held the lead only 6-5. However in the second half, the Gauchos pulled away outscoring Pepperdine 11-5 on their way to an eventual 17-10 win.</p>\n<p>Sophomore two-meter Nicholas Jordan and junior attacker Eric Van de Mortel led the Gaucho offensive attack with a combined seven goals on the day. UCSB held strong on the defensive side as well. Sophomore keeper Whitelegge racked up six crucial saves in the first two quarters to maintain the Gaucho’s lead at half.</p>\n<p>Even an impressive performance by sophomore utility player Luke Hewko was not enough for Pepperdine to attain the win. Hewko provided three goals, adding to his total of 46 for the season.</p>\n<p>“[It was a] great game; [we] had an amazing performance against Pepperdine who’s top 10 in the county and in the second half we sort of ran them out,” Wigo commented. “The six on five was great all weekend; the power play had a very high percentage.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to Long Beach on Saturday to play No. 7 Long Beach State (16-5 overall) before heading home to compete against No. 1 USC (19-1 overall) on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kevin Yang of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52542\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-defeats-pepperdine-falls-to-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52542\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-defeats-pepperdine-falls-to-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-defeats-pepperdine-falls-to-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-defeats-pepperdine-falls-to-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-defeats-pepperdine-falls-to-cal/","id":5111,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[5110,5109,5108],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sees Top Keepers in Pair of Games this Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Preview UCSB women's soccer vs. UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After splitting its road games last week, the UCSB women’s soccer team will stay at home to play UC Riverside this Friday before traveling to Cal State Fullerton on Sunday, in what is the team’s second-to-last week of conference play remaining.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes into the weekend’s matches with an overall record of 8-6-1 and 2-2 in the Big West conference.

Taking over the starting position at the beginning of the season, Ritter has amassed seven shutouts, the most in the Big West. The eight combined shutouts this year rank fifth in program history for a single season and the most since 2008.</p>\n<p>Although Ritter has been one of the hottest goalkeepers, the Gauchos will encounter goalies just as impressive this weekend. Both Riverside’s and Fullerton’s goalkeepers rank in the top three in save percentage and shutouts.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside suffered its first conference loss last week against UC Irvine by a 2-0 margin. Prior to that the Highlanders had outscored its opponents 5-1 in two league matches with much of the success due in large part to sophomore goalkeeper Elizabeth Silas who ranks fourth in the Big West in total saves (73). Silas has allowed only three goals in the last four games and has emerged as an elite goalkeeper in the Big West.</p>\n<p>After playing UC Riverside, Santa Barbara travels south to Fullerton for another conference challenge. Fullerton’s goalkeeper, senior Lindsey Maricic ranks first in save percentage and total saves so far this season, being a deciding factor in the two games the Titans have earned results in.</p>\n<p>Aside from Maricic on the defensive side of the ball, UCSB will also have to take into account senior midfielder/forward Erica Mazeau.

Nevertheless, Saturday’s matchup against Pepperdine will be the first game between the two teams this season.</p>\n<p>Although standing at 7-6, the Waves head into the game with momentum, having won four of their last five games.</p>\n<p>The factor that may most impact the result of Saturday’s game is the play of Pepperdine’s leading scorer and redshirt sophomore utility Luke Hewko. Hewko ranks first on the team in goals scored with 43 on the year, including 19 this past weekend at the SoCal Tournament. In the Waves’ final game of the tourney, Hewko dominated, tallying a season-high seven goals.</p>\n<p>Then on Sunday, Santa Barbara will look for revenge against Cal after a tough 11-3 loss last weekend.</p>\n<p>In that game, the Gauchos struggled offensively, earning one goal only in each of first three quarters and none in fourth. The Golden Bears, on the other hand, went on a 5-1 run to start the game and never looked back, improving to 11-4 on the year.</p>\n<p>Eight players scored a goal for Cal, with junior attacker Aleksa Saponjic (an Olympian for Serbia) leading the way with three goals. Saponjic, who played at the 2012 Olympics for Serbia, currently has 24 goals on the season and makes up one piece of the Golden Bears’ balanced attack.</p>\n<p>To be victorious, UCSB will need to improve its offense. To do so, the Gauchos will rely on senior attacker Matt Gronow, who anchors Santa Barbara’s attack with a team-high 38 goals on the season. Not far is behind is junior attacker Derek Shoemaker with a total of 31 goals.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game against Pepperdine will start at noon at Raleigh Runnels Memorial Pool. Sunday’s home game against Cal will also begin at noon at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kevin Yang of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52511\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/no-6-gauchos-face-pepperdine-on-the-road-saturday-return-home-sunday-for-rematch-against-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52511\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/no-6-gauchos-face-pepperdine-on-the-road-saturday-return-home-sunday-for-rematch-against-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/no-6-gauchos-face-pepperdine-on-the-road-saturday-return-home-sunday-for-rematch-against-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/no-6-gauchos-face-pepperdine-on-the-road-saturday-return-home-sunday-for-rematch-against-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/no-6-gauchos-face-pepperdine-on-the-road-saturday-return-home-sunday-for-rematch-against-cal/","id":5110,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[5109,5108,5107],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seek Win Against Top Team in the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"preview women's volleyball against Cal State Northridge, UC Davis","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off what is undoubtedly its biggest win of the season in Hawaii, the UCSB women’s volleyball team returns home this weekend to host Big West leader Cal State Northridge and UC Davis.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, now at 8-8 overall, 3-1 in the Big West and in sole possession of third place in the conference, will be looking to ride the momentum of an impressive three-match winning streak heading into Friday’s match against Northridge.

The loss dropped the Rainbow Wahine from No. 3 in the nation to No. 10.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely feeling confident,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “We feel that since we did take down one of the biggest teams in the nation our abilities are unlimited right now.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB is going to be able to take down the conference’s top team for the second weekend in a row, they will likely have to follow the same winning formula that they have found in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>The key player in this formula has been Thompson, whose performance in one of the most important games of her senior year against Hawaii could go down as her best ever. The team’s leading scorer all year, Thompson ended the game with a career-high 26 points that included 19 kills and 11 blocks on her way to earning her first-ever Big West Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge honor, but obviously I didn’t do it all by myself,” Thompson said. “We had a huge team effort in beating Hawaii; they definitely helped me receive the award.”</p>\n<p>Senior Leah Sully has also been a huge part in the team’s recent wins, and not in the way she has been in the past. The team has gone 3-1 ever since Sully’s move from outside hitter to libero, and she has compiled 20 digs twice during the stretch.</p>\n<p>Northridge boasts the second-most prolific offense in the conference, only behind Hawaii, averaging 13.94 kills per set on a 0.274 kill percentage. However, the Gauchos only need to look to last weekend, when they held Hawaii to a 0.111 kill percentage, to feel good about their chances defensively.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working a lot on our blocking, so hopefully [it] carries over from the Hawaii match,” Thompson said. “If we keep an aggressive mindset we’ll be able to come out on top.”</p>\n<p>One of the Matador’s top contributors on the offensive side will be senior setter Sydney Gedryn, who is currently third in the Big West at 10.57 assists per set.</p>\n<p>“[Gedryn] is very physical,” Thompson said. “We’re definitely going to have to take care of her and also make sure that we take care of their pin hitters.”</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos will be busy trying to beat a defense led by junior libero Megan Lancaster that leads the conference in digs. Sophomore outside hitter Kaylin Sguyres will also be a player to watch out for as she leads the Aggies with 3.08 kills per set this year.</p>\n<p>“[Sguyres] is a strong right side so we definitely need to watch out for her,” Thompson said. “But once again blocking and our defense are the two aspects that we need to focus on [against Davis].”</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts Northridge on Friday and UC Davis on Saturday. Both games will be played at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52514\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52514\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/","id":5312,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5311,5310,5309],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Soccer: Back on Top","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-8.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-8.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 3 UCSB travels to UC Davis","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Off to its best start in conference play since 2009, the No. 3 UCSB men’s soccer team, leaders atop the Big West North Division will travel to UC Davis on Saturday in its first matchup against a division foe.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters Saturday with a 9-4 overall and a 4-0 Big West record after winning five-straight matches with a chance to extend its two game lead over Davis who sits second in the North Division at 6-6-1 overall and 2-2 in conference.</p>\n<p>“We just have to find a way to win the game; we don’t care how it happens,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Ever since the New Mexico and Stanford games where we found ways to lose, we’ve matured a little bit, gotten better.

Two weeks ago McNeely was named Big West Defensive Player of the Week, an honor awarded to senior defender Peter Schmetz on Monday, as Gauchos have owned the award the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>“From the start our goal has been to win our conference and after that the goal would be to win the conference tournament,” McNeely said. “Going beyond that, getting to the final four and far in playoffs would be a big step for the program.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Gaucho offense is senior forward Achille Campion, who leads the team and ranks tied for fifth in the conference with five goals scored on the season. Senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko ranks right behind Campion with four goals this season.</p>\n<p>Aiding the two seniors are a pair of freshmen in midfielder Drew Murphy and forward Ismaila Jome. Murphy’s six assists this season rank tied for first in the Big West, while Jome’s five tie for fourth.</p>\n<p>The Aggies enter Saturday fresh off a 2-0 victory over Riverside, a win that ended a two-game skid in conference play.</p>\n<p>“The stats kind of tell it all for Davis. What that tells you is they can beat anybody … but then they can also lose to anybody,” Vom Steeg said. “They don’t give up a lot and they don’t get a lot and that’s a recipe for a low-scoring game, which we have been fortunate in the last two games to find a way to win. Hopefully we can do that again on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Davis, a team known for low-scoring affairs, has scored a mere 10 goals in 13 games this season, tied for second-fewest in the Big West. Similarly, the Aggies have allowed only 11 goals this season, tied with UCSB for the fewest in the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ranks third in the Big West with 20 goals scored this season as they struggled to put the ball in the back of the net early in the season. In the last four games, however, the Gauchos have scored at least two goals in every game, once putting up three in a victory over Fullerton.</p>\n<p>One key to the game may be how effectively the Gauchos can attack a stout Aggies’ defense and put a ball between the posts. Factoring in Davis’ inability to score and the Gauchos’ knack for shutting opponents down, Santa Barbara may be on its way to taking a three-game lead in the Big West north if it can score an early goal on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We are now playing the teams in our own division and these are now six-point swings,” Vom Steeg said. “Either we jump ahead three games or we go back down to one game.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s kickoff is scheduled for 3 p.m. at Aggie Soccer Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/","id":1611,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1610,1609,1608],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Opponents Fear the Freshman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mcneely2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mcneely2.jpg?resize=980%2C625&ssl=1","description":"Freshman Goalkeeper Josh McNeely has locked up the goal for UCSB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Most fall quarter freshmen are worried about avoiding the “freshman 15” and transitioning from home to independent college life.

However, soccer always stood out to Josh as his favorite and the one he was best at.</p>\n<p>By age 10, McNeely made the part-time transition to goalkeeper, a move that became permanent at the age of 12.</p>\n<p>“I started playing goalkeeper when I was around 10, which is kind of late,” McNeely said. “My coach put me in there because I was one of the biggest guys on the team. Just making big saves in big games attracted me to the position.”</p>\n<p>Although his move to goalkeeper may have been purely random based on his size, McNeely immediately showed he had a knack for the position.</p>\n<p>His U-16 squad won the U.S. Soccer Academy National Championship, a personal highlight of McNeely’s youth career. Perhaps his most influential moments in youth soccer however came from his training with the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy. While there, he learned from Ian Feuer, current goalkeeper coach for the Galaxy and former MLS and English Premier League goalie.</p>\n<p>“He definitely was a mentor and a great coach growing up,” McNeely said. “He taught me most of what I know about goalkeeping and the position, everything from technique to the mental part of the game. He’s definitely a big reason why I’m still playing today at this level.”</p>\n<p>Growing up in Calabasas, a mere hour from Santa Barbara, McNeely had familiarity with both Santa Barbara and UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg. Josh’s parents were family friends with Vom Steeg’s sister-in-law, a coincidence that put McNeely on UCSB’s radar since he was 12.</p>\n<p>“When Josh was a young player, I would hear stories from my sister-in-law that her friend’s son was a really good soccer player. The funny part is that you hear that story quite a bit,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>McNeely committed to attend UCSB his junior year of high school, attributing the weather, location, atmosphere and large and successful soccer program for bringing him an hour north of his childhood.</p>\n<p>As coincidence would have it again, McNeely came to Santa Barbara with a fellow impact freshman in midfielder Drew Murphy, with whom Josh had played against growing up since the age of nine until they played on the same Galaxy team at 14.</p>\n<p>“The Galaxy both called us in when we were 14. And it’s funny going from rivals to being good friends on the same team,” Murphy said. “Josh, when we were little, I would like to say he was a knucklehead because of the rivalry.”</p>\n<p>Now in Santa Barbara, McNeely has risen to the challenge of starting as a true freshman, allowing only eight goals in 11 starts, four of which were shutouts. UCSB has won eight of Josh’s 11 starts and seems to have finally found its groove with its first year goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>“He’s been able to avoid mistakes and that’s kind of the real key right now. Every game that goes by, I think he gains some real confidence,” Vom Steeg said. “He has the respect of the players in front of him, he has the respect of the team.”</p>\n<p>With a senior-led backline, the Gauchos defense has been the anchor of the team the entire season, a statement made that much more accurate with McNeely’s emergence. During the first week of conference play, McNeely garnered Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors, and helped lead UCSB to four straight victories to open conference play.</p>\n<p>Already in his first two months in college, McNeely has shown he has all the tools necessary to help UCSB achieve its goal of winning the Big West crown.</p>\n<p>“The good thing about Josh is he’s very humble, he takes a workmanlike approach. I think he has the right mentality and temperament,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s a calm player; he doesn’t play nervous even if he is nervous. Those are all characteristics that can take you far.”</p>\n<p>While McNeely wants to improve as a player during college, his ultimate dream is to play professionally, either overseas or in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Without a doubt [he’ll play professionally], I don’t even think that’s a question at this point. He has all the tools he needs and it’s just up to him whether or not he wants to,” Murphy said. “As a goalie, it takes a lot more time than a field player. The pro game will without a doubt be in his future at some point.”</p>\n<p>The way McNeely has handled the pressure as not only the starting goalkeeper for UCSB but as a freshman transitioning to college, makes his future in Santa Barbara and beyond looks promising.</p>\n<p>With McNeely between the posts this season and hopefully for the next three after, the Gauchos possess one of the most promising defensive players in the entire country.</p>\n<p>“He has the skill set to play at the next level. He has the right temperament to play goalkeeper at the next level,” Vom Steeg said. “The question is going to be what he puts into it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continues play Saturday when they face UC Davis on the road for a 3 p.m. kickoff.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 16, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of UCSB Athletics.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/","id":1608,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1607,1606,1605],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dodgers Trying to Stay Alive in the Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dodgers.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dodgers.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Pitching will be key if the Dodgers want to come back and reach the World Series.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After losing game two of the National League Championship series, the Los Angeles Dodgers were having déjà vu, but it was not the nostalgic kind. Matt Kemp is out for the season, Hanley Ramirez broke a rib after being hit by a 96 mph fastball and Andre Ethier looks as rusty as he’s ever been after missing extended time with an injury.</p>\n<p>To top things off, the Dodgers had just lost the advantage of their trump card. After losing games one and two in which Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw pitched, L.A.’s greatest strength was nullified. L.A. couldn’t get across the key run in game one, wasting valuable scoring opportunities and losing in extra innings. The Dodger bats got even colder in game two, with the team failing to score a run and losing a great Kershaw start on a sacrifice fly. Yasiel Puig was hitless through the first two games, and Ramirez never got the chance to hit in a key situation with the Cardinals constantly pitching around him.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, Carl Crawford has been enjoying a power surge, accounting for the only two runs in game one for the Dodgers. It just wasn’t enough to overcome a deep and fundamentally sound St. Louis team. Ethier missed a ball in centerfield that was enough to nullify Greinke’s excellence and send the game to extras, and the Redbird crowd was ridculously loud in extra innings. Despite seeing the potential that got Los Angeles to the NLCS in the first place, it was St. Louis that kept doing the little things necessary to win the close games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With Hyu-Jin Ryu going against St. Louis Cardinals’ ace Adam Wainwright, things were looking grim for the team that was favored to win the World Series weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, Ryu is no slouch. The South Korean native finished the regular season with 14 wins and a 3.00 ERA — impressive numbers that warrant Rookie of the Year considerations. However, Ryu was less than stellar in his first career postseason start, allowing six hits and four runs in three innings. Whether it was nerves or another injury that plagued Ryu, he did not look like himself.</p>\n<p>After getting swept in the first phase of games in St. Louis, L.A. rebounded in a big way upon their return to Chavez Ravine. Ryu pitched like the master control specialist we all knew he could be. His changeup was on point, painting the corners of the strike zone for seven flawless innings, and the Dodgers won 3-0 on Puig, Gonzales and Ramirez’s RBIs. The Dodgers got their clutch hits when they mattered, and the defense backed up Ryu for the shutout.</p>\n<p>At press time, the Los Angeles Dodgers face a 3-1 deficit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series with revitalized hope. Ryu’s reemergence assures that the Dodgers will get one more shot to throw an ace on the table, with Greinke slated to go in game five. One win in two games at home will give the ball back to Kershaw for game six.</p>\n<p>After a tremendous performance that ultimately resulted in a loss, Kershaw has his eyes set on nothing short of a perfect game in his next start, should it come about. That might be aiming high for any other pitcher in baseball, but not Kershaw’s. The numbers speak for themselves. An ERA of 1.83 puts Kershaw’s name up among the ranks of Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Bob Gibson and the ‘first coming’ of Kershaw, an old Dodger named Sandy Koufax. He has allowed less than one baserunner an inning, and every start in which the Dodgers do not win when he’s on the mound is considered a failure.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers went 42-8 over a 50-game stretch that began in June when the team was in last place. It started with the return of Ramirez from injury and the 10,000-watt jumpstart known as Puig. And so was the story when L.A. won game three on Monday. The parallelism is eerily similar.</p>\n<p>Call me optimistic, but I’m expecting something special. The team can take notes and watch video of the different stretches in the season to see what they did right and what they did wrong. And manager Don Mattingly will keep the atmosphere calm, collected and focused. The Dodgers are at their best when their hitters don’t try to do too much, get on base instead of swing for the fences and trust their teammates.</p>\n<p>Ricky Nolasco couldn’t hold his own on Tuesday night against Lance Lynn, but the Dodgers will be in prime position to pull off a three game upset with Greinke going at home in game five and Kershaw in a position to potentially pull even the series back in St. Louis.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is entirely skeptical. The Dodgers are still down and need to continue to figure out ways to win. In the first two games of the series, L.A. made mistakes and did not capitalize with runners in scoring position. But St. Louis made fielding mistakes in game three that prove they aren’t perfect. Make no mistake about it; the Dodgers will go as far as their pitching takes them. The offense is hit or miss, no pun intended, with all the injuries up and down the lineup.</p>\n<p>But L.A. has been in this position before. The situation following game two is too similar to where the team saw themselves in June. They overcame injuries and missed opportunities before, and now they know exactly how to do it again. The Cardinals are known to play mistake-free baseball, so the Dodgers will have to capitalize on their superior talent by matching them play for play. After overcoming St. Louis’ ace and getting back in this series, L.A. is buzzing for baseball once more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of October 16, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Art by Emily Zhang of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52490\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52490\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/","id":3235,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3234,3233,3232],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Indianapolis Colts: A Force to be Reckoned With","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With Andrew Luck at Quarterback, the Colts Will Be Great for Many Years to Come","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Indianapolis Colts are a dynasty in the making in the NFL and will place amongst the top teams in the league for years to come. This all starts at quarterback for the Colts, with second-year player Andrew Luck running the offense. Make no mistake: Luck is a franchise quarterback and one of the top prospects to come out of the draft in the last decade.</p>\n<p>Think about how incredibly lucky the Colts franchise has been in finding itself at the top of the draft board with “once-in-a-decade” quarterbacks at the top of the list in Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. While Indianapolis may have sacrificed the opportunity to win a Super Bowl now by allowing Manning to leave town, the Colts have set themselves up for the potential to win Super Bowls years after Manning retires with Luck at the helm.</p>\n<p>Luck has the accuracy and arm strength to stretch the field and keep defenders honest. However, one of the things that really separates Luck from prototypical quarterbacks is his athleticism. If you’ve ever seen Luck play, you know he has some wheels and can shake off a defender down the field or in the pocket. He’s a big guy and combines the best of a mobile and prototypical pocket quarterback, holding the top qualities a coach would look for in each respective player type.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Aside from Luck, however, the Colts possess one of the top front offices in the NFL, with Head Coach Chuck Pagano and General Manager Ryan Grigson, who pulled the trigger by pulling off one of the most surprising trades in recent NFL memory. The Colts turned a first-round pick, likely somewhere in the late teens to early 20s, into running back Trent Richardson, the former No. 3 overall pick in the 2012 draft. Richardson may not be living up to expectations thus far in his career, but he is still one of the most dangerous young backs in the league, finishing last season with 1,317 total yards and 12 total touchdowns, an impressive total for a first-year running back.</p>\n<p>With the combination of Luck and Richardson in the Colts’ backfield, Indianapolis possesses two premiere, young offensive weapons, and the Colts have the opportunity to allow Richardson and Luck to pick apart defenses and establish one of the most balanced attacks in the game.</p>\n<p>Complementing Luck and Richardson is a trio of pass catchers that help to stretch the field. Receiver Reggie Wayne has had the opportunity of playing with both Manning and Luck and is still a dangerous and productive wideout despite his age. Wayne is one of the most underrated and consistent receivers in the NFL in the last 10 years.</p>\n<p>Wayne may be near the twilight of his career, but fellow receiver T.Y. Hilton is just getting started. The second-year pro finished his rookie campaign with over 800 yards receiving and seven touchdowns. Through five games this season, Hilton is on track to register a 1,000-yard season and is establishing himself as a dangerous down the field option.</p>\n<p>Finishing out this trio is second-year tight end Coby Fleener, Luck’s former teammate while at Stanford. Fleener may not be as established as Hilton, and seems to disappear at times, but the rapport with Luck is there and he is still projected to finish with six touchdowns and nearly 600 receiving yards this season. Fleener gives Luck a viable option over the middle of the field and is a talented receiver in goal line situations.</p>\n<p>If you notice many second-year players amongst the Colts’ offense, that’s because this is an extremely young squad. All of these players will have a chance to grow together as a unit and become one of the top units in the league.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Colts are paced by the ageless Robert Mathis, who leads the NFL with 9.5 sacks entering Monday night’s game against the Chargers.</p>\n<p>The Colts aren’t a flashy team, but they find ways to win, and against tough competition, too. Already this season, Indianapolis had impressive wins over San Francisco and Seattle, two teams many projected as the top squads in the league entering the season. Indianapolis is showing it has the team to compete now, as they made the playoffs last season as a wild-card team.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most telling game of the season for the Colts will be a Week Seven matchup when they host Manning and the undefeated Denver Broncos, thought to be the best team in the NFL this season. The results from this game will give the NFL a better idea of just how close the Colts are towards taking that next step from playoff team to Super Bowl contender.</p>\n<p>If the Colts are winning these games now with such a young roster, imagine what they can do three years down the road when all their personnel reaches the early prime of their careers. The Colts are already a scary team; I can’t imagine how much scarier they will become if all their players develop as expected. Indianapolis is once again a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/","id":3231,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3230,3229,3228],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Weekend Road Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_05.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_05.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in fourth place in the Big West standings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For its first road trip of the conference season, the UCSB women’s soccer team split its two games on the weekend, losing to the University of Hawaii on Thursday but bouncing back on Sunday for a 1-0 win against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>With the split over the weekend, UCSB is now 8-6-1 overall and 2-2 in the Big West. The two conference wins are the same number of conference victories the Gauchos had all of last year. After Hawaii’s win on Thursday night, the Warriors improve to .500 at 6-6 on the season and are 1-2 in conference. Meanwhile, the Matador’s conference struggles continue as they remain winless at 0-3-1 and 5-9-1 overall.</p>\n<p>UCSB was quick to bounce back early against the Matadors after Thursday’s disappointing loss against the Warriors. In the 14th minute of play the Gauchos got on the board when sophomore midfielder Angelisa Cortez drew the goalkeeper out of the goal, after cutting past the defense. Cortez slid the ball to senior forward Allie Ariniello who had an open goal and put UCSB up 1-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was Ariniello’s fourth goal of the season, second-most on the team, and Cortez’s first assist on the year.</p>\n<p>The game remained even from there on going into the half. Possession of the ball switched between teams in the last 45 minutes of play; each team struggled to maintain control of the ball as the defense from both teams demonstrated solid play in the backline. UCSB benefitted from the early score and played defense against Northridge in the final minutes of the game.</p>\n<p>With less than five minutes left in the game, CSUN had one last shot on goal, but sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter blocked the ball for her second save of the game, giving UCSB the victory. The 1-0 result is the fourth occasion UCSB has won by that score and more notably, all of UCSB’s wins this year have come by way of shutout.</p>\n<p>UCSB travelled to Hawaii for its first road game of the conference season on Thursday; previously the Gauchos had been a respectable 2-3-1 away from Harder Stadium going into the match. Both teams were even in the first half and went tied 0-0 going into halftime, having the same number of shots in the first period with four each.</p>\n<p>Consistency has been a problem for the Gauchos in the second half of games with the team often wearing down towards the end of matches. Against the Warriors, UCSB again had a difficult time trying to maintain its same level of play. Hawaii outshot the Gauchos 9-4 in the second half and pressured Santa Barbara for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>With 10 minutes remaining, the UCSB defense let Hawaii’s main offensive threat let loose. Junior forward Tiana Fujimoto, who entered the game second in the Big West with six goals, ran past the defense and unleashed a shot from the left side of the field that deflected off the post, and into the back of the net. UCSB had one final attempt on a corner kick in the final minutes of the game but was called for offsides, giving the 1-0 win to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB now has only four games remaining in its regular season schedule. With two weekends of play left, the Gauchos will have to earn results in the games left in order to remain in contention for a spot in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will stay at home to face UC Riverside on Friday and then hit the road once again to face Cal State Fullerton on Sunday evening.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em></em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 14, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Photo by Magali Gauthier of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52458\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52458\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/","id":1604,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1603,1602,1601],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":144,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
