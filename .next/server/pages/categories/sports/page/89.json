The Gauchos climbed a spot in the national rankings despite the loss as they now sit at 4-2 in MPSF play, 8-3 overall.</p>\n<p>The loss against the 49ers ended UCSB’s three-game winning streak. Awaiting Santa Barbara next is another prominent opponent in the Cougars.</p>\n<p>BYU is tied with the Gauchos for fourth place in the conference standings with a 4-2 record, 6-2 overall. The matchup between Santa Barbara and BYU has been even in recent years, with the teams splitting matches by a mark of 2-2 in the past two years.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s always a huge bummer losing a close one like that, but we know we are a good team who can bounce back,” redshirt junior libero Parker Boehle said. “Now we have a great chance to take down one of the top teams in the country at their home court.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ last four MPSF meetings, Boehle has been steady defensively, averaging seven digs per match. The libero has started in most of the team’s matches since the beginning of league play, but also splits time with his little brother, sophomore libero Hayden Boehle. The siblings combined for 13 digs in the Long Beach match.</p>\n<p>UCSB is heading on the road with strong confidence after its intense match against LBSU. Despite its inability to maintain its lead in the final set of the match, Santa Barbara knows it cannot allow the loss to linger as there will be opportunities to compete against the nation’s top teams throughout the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>Defeating the Cougars on the road will be no easy feat, considering the elevation of the school sits at 4,630 feet, significantly higher than the 46-foot elevation of UCSB’s campus. The thin Utah air poses a physical challenge that is difficult to prepare for.</p>\n<p>“Provo is the toughest place to play in our league and BYU is always ranked in the top three,” Head Coach Rick Mclaughlin said. “They have a real home court advantage, but coming off last Friday’s battle I think we’ll be ready to compete hard.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were well aware that they had a great chance to win the match against Long Beach State, and players were vocal that they made too many mistakes and gifted their opponents too many points.</p>\n<p>“We have to make fewer errors towards the end of games,” Parker Boehle said. That’s something we are working on going forward.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 26 hitting errors last Friday set a season-high, it was also the team’s first time with over 20 since the first week of the season. Additionally, the Gauchos made three errors –two hitting and one service —which occurred while Long Beach scored the last five points of the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are aiming to break away from the pack of 4-2 teams in the MPSF standings this week while playing at BYU, and the pair of road games are sure to provide a stern test for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces BYU this Friday, Feb. 5 at 7 p.m. at Smith Fieldhouse. The two teams play again on Saturday, Feb. 6 at the same time and location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67863\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67863\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/","id":5060,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5059,5058,5057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 11 UCSB Goes 3-1 at Michigan Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_5-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Back-to-back overtime wins highlighted a successful weekend for the Gauchos as they dropped just one game at the Michigan Invitational.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67805\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67805\" data-attachment-id=\"67805\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/no-11-ucsb-goes-3-1-at-michigan-invitational/sophie-trabucco-blocks-an-opponent-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_5-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sophie Trabucco blocks an opponent.

It was junior defender Sophie Trabucco who opened up the scoreboard at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243779\">7:00</span> mark. However, the Hawks quickly responded with three consecutive goals from Katie McKenty, LJ Edwards, and Lauren Brennan.</p>\n<p>Hartwick once again came out strong in the second quarter and went on another 3-1 run putting them in the lead 6-3 with three minutes left in the half. UCSB executed on consecutive possessions shortening the Hawks lead, but the Hawks found the back of the cage in the last second to take them into half time with a two score lead.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was a constant battle for the Gauchos who tied the score in two occasions, only to have Hartwick reclaim their lead shortly after. With little time left on the clock, Santa Barbara turned to senior center Lauren Martin who scored 21 seconds after the Hawks had gained a two-goal lead, and was followed by junior attacker Brenna Thomas on a power play to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s senior attacker Bryn Hudson scored first in overtime, Brittany Tait would give the Hawks another chance by forcing the game into sudden death. This was the first time Santa Barbara had gone into sudden death so far in the season.</p>\n<p>It was Martin who won the sprint to give UCSB the first possession, in which she capitalized with the winning goal after 21 seconds to finish 15-14.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day proved to be just as challenging for the Gauchos who came out on top after another overtime game against Pacific.</p>\n<p>Carrying on the momentum from the first match, Martin scored back-to-back goals to start the game. The Tigers found the back of the net on three occasions to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore reclaimed the lead at the start of the second period, scoring on her own rebound after her shot had gone off the post the first time.</p>\n<p>The Tigers had a comeback in the second quarter. For the first time in the game they took the lead after a penalty shot taken by Rachel Krieger. Pacific was now on top with a two-goal lead by the halftime break.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly came back and tied the game within the first minute of the third period with the help of Thomas who set up senior utility Samantha Murphy and Martin on back-to-back possessions.</p>\n<p>The seesaw battle carried on to the last period, in what looked like the Tigers would pull off the win after scoring with only 38 seconds left. But the Gauchos drew an ejection foul and took advantage on their last possession, with Shore scoring the equalizer with 13 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored first in overtime with Shore assisting Martin, followed by freshman defender Kristen Denney to end the first OT period. The tigers tried to fight back, but their goal from Ellen Tiedmann was retaliated by junior utility Miranda Schrader securing the win for the Gauchos, 13-11.</p>\n<p>Martin finished the day with a total of seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against Pacific making it the second game in the season in which she collects that many. Contributing to the day’s success were Hudson, Schrader, and Thomas with four goals of their own.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos split the final day of the invitational falling to No. 7 Michigan, the top ranked team in the tournament, in a 14-8 loss and another nail biter win over No. 15 San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines scored the first goal of the game, but were answered by Thomas to put UCSB on the board. Although the Gauchos scored once again, they also allowed two goals sending them into the second quarter behind Michigan 4-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored on three occasions in the second quarter, two of them coming from Murphy, but Michigan put away four unanswered goals to stay on top.</p>\n<p>The 11-5 lead by the Wolverines proved to be too much for the Gauchos despite two goals by sophomore utility Camila Schafer and Kreiser.

UCSB earned its first road win of the season at Fullerton, defeating the Titans 65-47.

While these aren’t groundbreaking statistics, UCSB’s decrease in turnovers helped it to establish a rhythmic flow on offense. It had recorded less turnovers than its opponents on three-straight occasions.</p>\n<p>Yet, a slow upward trend in turnovers has affected the Gauchos in their two losses. UCSB hadn’t registered over 14 turnovers since its first meeting at UCR, ending this streak with 16 at UCR and 17 at UCD.</p>\n<p>The rise in turnovers can be viewed as a warning signal for a team that once averaged 20 turnovers per game during its non-conference schedule. While the Gauchos have improved in their protection of the ball since the start of Big West play, UCSB’s battle with turnovers begins in its backcourt.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and sophomore guard Makala Roper both rank top 10 in the Big West in turnovers per game with overall averages of 3.3 and 4.2. However, the Gauchos’ average of 15.1 assists per game ranks third in the Big West in addition to them being second in steals per game with 8.9 per contest.</p>\n<p>In spite of the turnovers, Roper has been the driving force for the Gauchos’ scoring this season as she leads UCSB with a 12.5 points per game average. She also holds a fifth place ranking in the Big West in three-point percentage at 36.3 percent while her total of 41 three-pointers made this season is just five away from the conference lead. Freshman Coco Miller is just seven threes away from the conference lead of 46 with a total of 39 made perimeter shots on the year.</p>\n<p>Not known much as a scorer but rather as a floor general for the Gauchos’ offense, Jemerigbe has emerged with back-to-back games of double-figures in points despite the team’s pair of losses. She notched a career-high 16 points at UCR and had 15 points in the team’s loss at UCD.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held Fullerton to a 32.7 field goal percentage in its first matchup against the Titans. It was the Gauchos’ defense that influenced their offense as they scored 20 points off 15 Fullerton turnovers.</p>\n<p>CSUF will be hoping for an improved performance by forward Michelle Berry after a 6-23 shooting night in the team’s first game against the Gauchos. Though the first-year player concluded the game with a double-double of 14 points and 11 rebounds, Berry was responsible for seven of the Titans’ turnovers.</p>\n<p>The latest addition of junior center Dhanyel Johnson to its starting lineup may help reduce the team’s dependence on Berry for the remainder of the season. After a zero-point outing in 15 minutes of play in her first start of the season at Hawaii, Johnson took advantage of her 37 minutes this past Saturday at CSUN achieving her first career double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Junior center Je Zhe Newton scored a season-high 15 points in the Gauchos’ first bout against Fullerton, but had missed the last two of UCSB’s three games recently making a return at UCD in which she recorded seven points and five rebounds in 16 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton is set for Wednesday, Feb. 3 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB led 11-8 in the final set, but were unable to hang on for the upset, as the ‘Beach’, led by freshman outside hitter TJ DeFalco, finished the game on a four-point run to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>“We really should have won that match, we were up three points late in the fifth set, but we talked after the game in the locker room and agreed that we put together a pretty good effort and there wasn’t much to be upset about,” UCSB redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson said.</p>\n<p>Delson struggled in the first two sets of the match, notching four attacking errors and zero kills, but still showed improvements during the second. By the end of the night, the outside hitter had a team-high 14 kills. Redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh also ended the match with 14 kills.</p>\n<p>Delson and Marsh, despite each tallying double-figures in kills, struggled hitting against the tough Long Beach defense, finishing the game with .140 and .143 kill percentages, well below each of their season averages of .257 and .303, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We made way too many errors,” Delson said. “We made a ton of hitting errors and some service errors that were pretty crucial.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, however, made up for poor hitting percentages with superb team defense. Marsh and redshirt senior Austin Kingi both tallied double-doubles in kills and digs while senior setter Jonah Seif finished with a match-high 15 digs. Redshirt freshman middle blocker Connor Drake led the front line with eight blocks, also a match-high.</p>\n<p>Long Beach made its fair share of mistakes too with 26 service errors to the Gauchos’ total of 10. Despite the errors by both sides, the momentum continued to shift between both teams as UCSB gave itself a great chance to win in the fifth set, only four points away from knocking off the No. 2 team in the nation.</p>\n<p>“This was a tough loss, no doubt about it,” Gauchos’ Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “But you have to experience a few of these to learn how to better deal with that tight atmosphere late in close matches.”</p>\n<p>With the MPSF season in full swing, McLaughlin’s team faces a tough string of matches, with five of its next six matches coming against Top 10 teams in the country, including No. 3 BYU this week, followed by No. 6 Stanford, No. 8 Pepperdine, and No. 9 Irvine.</p>\n<p>“It’s good we had this game early in the season because we have to learn how to fight and pull out a win in these long matches, and it should really help us out against BYU this week,” Delson said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host BYU for a two game series on Friday and Saturday at Rob Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67827\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/no-11-ucsb-unable-to-maintain-late-lead-vs-no-2-lbsu-lose-in-five-set-battle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67827\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/no-11-ucsb-unable-to-maintain-late-lead-vs-no-2-lbsu-lose-in-five-set-battle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/no-11-ucsb-unable-to-maintain-late-lead-vs-no-2-lbsu-lose-in-five-set-battle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/no-11-ucsb-unable-to-maintain-late-lead-vs-no-2-lbsu-lose-in-five-set-battle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-01/no-11-ucsb-unable-to-maintain-late-lead-vs-no-2-lbsu-lose-in-five-set-battle/","id":5059,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5058,5057,5056],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Cold Shooting Start Allows UCD to Prevail for 80-51 Rout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-8-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-8-of-13-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-12 shooting performance in the first quarter by the UCSB women's basketball team resulted in the Gauchos falling behind 22-8 and eventually ended in a 80-51 victory for UC Davis as the Aggies shot...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>While the UCSB women’s basketball team managed to defeat UC Davis 66-59 last Thursday despite a 12.5 field goal percentage in the first quarter, the Gauchos’ 3-12 shooting performance in the first period of Saturday’s contest resulted in them being outscored 22-8.

Completing the Aggies’ consistent shooting performance was their success from behind the three-point line, finishing 9-17 from long range.</p>\n<p>Attempting 10 of Davis’ 17 shots from beyond the arc were two of the Big West’s top three-point shooters in forwards senior Pele Gianotti and sophomore Celia Marfone.</p>\n<p>After earning her first career double-double against the Gauchos earlier this season, Gianotti provided another solid performance tallying a game-high 18 points on 7-10 shooting from the field, 4-7 from three-point range in addition to five rebounds, three assists and three steals. Marfone finished with 17 points on 7-12 shooting while going 2-3 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Supporting Davis’ assertive scoring start was its effort on defense as it held the Gauchos to eight points in the first quarter, nearly repeating its allowance of seven points to UCSB in the first period of last Thursday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ off shooting performance affected their leading scorer in sophomore guard Makala Roper as she went 4-14 from the field to conclude Saturday with 10 points, five rebounds and five assists. Yet, providing UCSB with scoring was backcourt leader Onome Jemerigbe. After a career-high 16 points at UC Riverside, the junior point guard followed up with a team-high 15 points as the Gauchos attempted to overcome their out of sync shooting.</p>\n<p>But, the Aggies sustained their lead with Marfone at the forefront of their 24-12 outscoring of UCSB in the second quarter. Her 12-point scoring outburst in the quarter helped guide UCD to its 46-20 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s shooting slump was most evident from the insufficient 14 minutes of play that senior guard Jasmine Ware displayed while on the court. After a career-high 23 points at UCR, her nine-game streak of double-figures in points came to an end as she went scoreless on a 0-3 overall and 0-2 three-point shooting effort while committing four turnovers, adding to the Gauchos’ total of 17.</p>\n<p>There was a more even exchange of points in the second half as the Aggies narrowly outscored UCSB 34-31 in the final two quarters. Still, it wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which UCSB shot over 40 percent from the field (42.9 percent) but could not supersede the Aggies’ 50 percent shooting in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara’s best shooting stretch occurred in the fourth quarter, the Gauchos already faced a 18-point deficit entering the period and were eventually defeated 80-51.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home to face Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday and Hawaii on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Contributing to the offense was attacker Bryn Hudson, who had seven assists and four goals as well.</p>\n<p>Aside from maintaining a tight defense throughout the weekend, the Gauchos also counted on senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw, who had 44 saves in total. In the last game against Wagner, Brokaw recorded a season-high of 15 saves, limiting the Seahawks to just six goals.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will begin the weekend against No.17 Hartwick. The Hawks, who will see their first action of the year this weekend, tied for 18th last season with an overall record of 20-19, collecting their 14th-straight 20-win season.</p>\n<p>Senior driver Brittany Tait received ACWPC Honorable Mention, All-American and CWPA Honorable mention for the Hawks in 2015. She led the team in steals with a total of 64, and recorded 42 goals during her junior season.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the first game, the Gauchos will take on No.12 Pacific. With an overall record of 1-3, the Tigers are on the hunt for wins.</p>\n<p>One of their key players is freshman attacker Kyra Christmas. The Alberta native kicked off her collegiate career with an outstanding performance at the LouStrong Invitational, scoring 19 goals in her first four games.</p>\n<p>Christmas helped the Canadian U-19 team to third place at the 2014 Pan Am games and was the top scorer at the Worlds Hungary Tournament.</p>\n<p>On Sunday the Gauchos will play against No. 7 Michigan in the afternoon and No.15 SDSU at night.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines finished with an overall 3-2 record in their appearance at the UCSB Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Michigan swept the weekly awards with senior attacker Ali Thomason who received CWPA Player of the Week after tallying 19 goals, two assists, four steals and 17-of-19 sprints won. The Defensive Player of the Week went to senior goalkeeper Julia Campbell, who had 35 saves, and the Rookie of the Week was awarded to freshman defender Kim Johnson who managed to put 12 away.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will wrap up the weekend with No.15 SDSU, who will play its first games of the year in this tournament.</p>\n<p>The reigning back-to-back Golden Coast Conference regular season champions have four returning All-American players, including Caroline Israels.</p>\n<p>The junior utility was named GCC Co-Player of the Year and earned ACWPC Honorable Mention All-American last season.

This Tuesday at the Arlington Theatre in downtown Santa Barbara, hundreds of fans were given the chance to admire the United States’ current standard of excellence and listen to the inspiring story of a woman who has helped change what the sport of soccer means across the country.</p>\n<p>“Life has changed tremendously, and for a good reason,” Lloyd said about the past year. “Women’s soccer has changed and our team has just transcended the game. We’ve reached heights that have been amazing. I’m still Carli from New Jersey and I still train hard on that, but my surroundings have changed.”</p>\n<p>Though her name may not be the most recognizable in the U.S. behind the likes of Landon Donovan and Abby Wambach, widely considered the greatest male and female American soccer players ever, when it has mattered most, Lloyd has been the one to step up for her country, and it’s not even debatable.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, the United States has reached the final match of the Olympics or the World Cup — the two most important finals the country can reach — a total of four times, coming out as the victor in three out of four of those matches.</p>\n<p>In its three final wins, the U.S. scored a total of eight goals. Carli Lloyd scored six of them.</p>\n<p>Now, for anyone familiar with the sport, it is a well-known fact that soccer isn’t all about goals; just ask any excellent midfielder who has been overshadowed by a forward that puts up better looking numbers than they do.</p>\n<p>In this case though, especially in a country that tends to reward tangible statistics as more valuable than the true impact any player brings to a given team, it is nice to see a U.S. athlete that is both rewarded with, and indisputably considered to be deserving of, the award.</p>\n<p>“What you see is what you get with me,” Lloyd said. “I don’t do it to be cool. I do it because that’s who I am as a person.”</p>\n<p>After a highlight reel of some of Lloyd’s greatest moments opened up the night, the eighth-most capped player in U.S. women’s soccer history with 212 career appearances came onto the stage to an ecstatic reception and was showered with applause throughout the night. After catching the audience up on her latest exploits, including a hat-trick against Ireland just five days ago, she was ready to give advice to the hundreds of young girls and boys in the crowd on what it takes to reach the highest level of soccer.</p>\n<p>“It’s not enough to just practice it a couple times a week. You basically have to do more than the person next to you, and that’s sort of my motto,” Lloyd said. “I train on every holiday — Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving — because I know that nobody else is training, and that gives me the extra edge. You look at every other person in this world that’s successful; Steve Jobs knocked on every person’s door, and the 50th person said, ‘Okay, I like your idea,’ and now everybody here has an Apple product. It’s just about being persistent and working hard towards that dream and goal of yours.”</p>\n<p>Now at the age of 33 and standing atop the world of women’s soccer, Lloyd has cemented her place in the history of the sport. However, as many in the audience found out Tuesday night, she did not have the easiest path to stardom.</p>\n<p>“Throughout my youth days, I was always the best on my team. I practiced a lot, I was super passionate about soccer,” Lloyd recounted. “Then, I get selected for the U-21 National Team, and I was like, ‘Wow, I’m not that good.’”</p>\n<p>At that point, Lloyd went from being the perennial top player on her team to someone who had to compete to get on the field at all.</p>\n<p>“My third year, my coach, Chris Petrucelli, was the first one to be fully honest with me, and he basically told me, ‘You’ve got loads of talent, but you’re not displaying it, you’re not working hard enough, you’re not fit,’” Lloyd said. “That was the first moment in my life that I had actually heard criticism and I was like, ‘What is this about? I’m 22, I’m perfect.’”</p>\n<p>After approaching her parents about her concerns over whether or not she should continue to pursue a career in soccer, Lloyd was lucky to be paired with trainer James Galanis, who had landed a job coaching her brother’s soccer team close to where Carli lived.<br>\n“James basically told everybody that he was going to get me on the national team and turn me into one of the best players in the world, and everybody laughed at him,” Lloyd said. “We’ve been working towards this dream and goal for the last 13 years, and here we are today.”</p>\n<p>Lloyd was then asked to recall her experiences playing for the USWNT, from her nervous first cap to the Americans’ dominant World Cup winning run in 2015 in which she was awarded the Golden Ball for the tournament’s top player.</p>\n<p>The moment that most fans could have expected, and one which Lloyd has surely come to be exhausted with talking about over the past six months, finally came when the 2015 World Cup Final against Japan was brought up.</p>\n<p>After the U.S. fell to Japan in a penalty shootout in the 2011 World Cup Final, the following four years were a journey of redemption for Lloyd and her teammates as they looked to finish atop the rest of the world for the first time since 1999. Thanks to Lloyd’s brilliant first half performance this past June, which saw her not only record a hat-trick through the first 16 minutes, but also arguably the most memorable goal in U.S. soccer history on a chip-shot from the midfield line, the Americans went on to a convincing 5-2 victory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1CT3xQOfng?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I remember looking at the clock 22 minutes in and thinking, ‘Just blow the whistle,’” Lloyd said. “When that whistle blew I was just so mentally and physically drained, I just dropped to my knees. You almost just want that moment to pause, because it’s over in the blink of an eye.”</p>\n<p>After years of watching the United States’ No. 10 jersey dominate the world at the highest level of women’s soccer, it was a surreal experience to be seated so close to her that when I swallowed water down the wrong pipe and began coughing uncontrollably, I was faced with the fear that I might distract her in the middle of her speech.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, that either didn’t happen, or she was professional enough to ignore it and continue speaking with a level of class and humility unmatched by any of her peers that I have had the chance to witness. Not surprisingly, one of the most pertinent topics of the hour and 15 minutes she spent on stage was the impact that she and her team have had on the American youth.</p>\n<p>“If I can be a role model and help inspire all these younger generations, that to me is priceless,” Lloyd said. “I want to instill values and things that you should do on and off the field so that all of you young folks watching can pick up on those things.”</p>\n<p>I still remember the first game I ever saw of the USWNT, in an exhibition all the way back in 2007. The men were coming off a disappointing group stage knockout in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, and soccer remained an unimportant sport in the world of sports in America.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the United States’ lack of awareness for the most popular sport on the globe, I thought to myself, ‘This team is amazing. They could beat the men if they played them.’ Since that time, Lloyd and her teammates, including Wambach, Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and many others, have helped transform the meaning of soccer in America and prove that it deserves a spot alongside the country’s other major sports.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe me? How about the fact that the U.S.-Japan World Cup Final in 2015 was the most-watched soccer match in U.S. history, bringing in 25.4 million viewers across the nation and 61 million worldwide?</p>\n<p>Or how about the fact that FIFA 16, the latest installment of the world’s best-selling sports game, featured the USWNT’s own Alex Morgan on the cover and gave players the chance to use women’s soccer athletes for the first time in history?</p>\n<p>Or how about the fact that the National Women’s Soccer League, founded in 2012, is heading into its fourth season, surpassing the three-year expiration date that faced both the Women’s United Soccer Association and Women’s Professional Soccer in 2003 and 2012, respectively?</p>\n<p>“We’re now entering our fourth year, which is a good sign,” Lloyd said. “The awareness is good. We just have to continue to sell seats and get people to the games.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the efforts of Lloyd and the rest of the USWNT, soccer has discovered a new meaning in the United States. Now, the world’s top player and her peers are only concerned with how to carry on with that progress and continue inspiring young athletes everywhere to make their own mark on the sport.</p>\n<p>“We’re really transforming the sport, it just continues to get better,” Lloyd said. “The ‘99 World Cup was a big turning point.

UC Davis regained its second place standing in the conference as a result of UCSB’s loss and with a 75-57 victory over Cal Poly. The Aggies will host Santa Barbara with records of 11-7 and 4-1 in Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Prior to the start of conference play, the Gauchos’ identity as a team was a questionable matter heading into the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>However, through six Big West games, UCSB’s identity continues to gradually build around its improvements on offense. Santa Barbara has nearly improved in every statistical category since the beginning of conference play. UCSB currently ranks third in the conference in field goal percentage at 45.8, fourth in points per game with an average of 68.0 and fifth in three-point percentage at 35.5.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara has improved offensively, its prowess on defense has turned into a source of scoring as the Gauchos’ average of 9.2 steals per game ranks second in the Big West. As UCSB has forced opponents to turn the ball over, it has influenced the flow of ball movement in UCSB’s offense and will be a vital asset in the Gauchos containing the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes you just think execution is on the offensive end, but it’s on the defensive end as well,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Their [UC Davis] guards will try to post us because we’re a lot smaller. For us to try to pressure the post on a pass will be important for us.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, UCSB averages 16.0 assists per game, ranking third in the Big West. Leading UCSB’s passing attack has been junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She ranks second in assists per game, nearly doubling her average since the start of conference play improving from 3.9 to 6.7 per contest. She posted a career-high 10 assists in the first meeting versus the Aggies as she dished dimes to teammates like sophomore guard Makala Roper who scored a game-high 26 points in the victory.</p>\n<p>“As a point guard, you’re always kind of held at a different level and Coach Bonnie has made that clear,” Jemerigbe said. “She’s been pushing me and every time she pushes me I get better. My teammates help me of course, without them knocking down the shots, I don’t get the assists.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s defense has been a disruption in the passing lanes for opponents, the Gauchos’ quick hands will not always make up for their size disadvantage. It is a drawback that has affected their performance when rebounding the ball, landing UCSB with a conference low average of 30.3 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Although Davis grabbed just seven more rebounds than UCSB in the first meeting, outrebounding the Gauchos 40-33, the Aggies’ ability to rebound the ball is essential to capitalizing on their size.</p>\n<p>Davis’ length provides a versatile element which goes beyond it being a threat in the paint. It is also the reason the Aggies have been such a lethal team when shooting the ball from beyond the arc in being able to rebound the ball and make the passes to set up perimeter shots.</p>\n<p>Their 39.5 three-point field goal percentage leads the Big West as senior forward Celia Marfone and sophomore forward Pele Gianotti are the Aggies’ top sharpshooters from long range. Both rank in the top five of the conference in three-point field goal percentage with Marfone owning a Big West leading 49 percent and Gianotti in second at 40.7 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Gianotti registered her first career double-double in Davis’ loss to UCSB, tallying 19 points and 10 rebounds. Her dual-threat ability to shoot from behind the perimeter and score in the post in the ideal complement to redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch.</p>\n<p>Bertsch is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 13.1 ppg in addition to her conference leading 58.1 field goal percentage which ranks 12<sup>th</sup> in the nation. As a team, Davis holds national rankings in field goal percentage (43.9 percent) and field goal percentage defense (36.3 percent), ranking 41<sup>st</sup> and 45<sup>th</sup> in the country along with ranking second in the conference in both statistical categories, respectively.</p>\n<p>UCD held UCSB to just seven points in the first quarter of last week’s contest. Yet, both teams registered first half field goal percentages below 30 percent in the initial meeting.</p>\n<p>“We always say don’t have amnesia,” Henrickson said. “The rules on offense are: drive it, shoot it, but don’t hold it. When things work, keep doing it and when things don’t work, quit doing it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tipoff at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 30 in the Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67617\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67617\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/","id":363,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[362,361,360],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Capitalize on Momentous Win, Face LBSU Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-30-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-30-web.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"In the middle of the pack in the Big West standings at fourth place, the UCSB men's basketball team has an opportunity to even out its 2-3 conference record in its matchup against Long Beach State ton...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off a big 74-61 win over Cal State Northridge on Saturday, the UCSB men’s basketball team heads on the road hoping to continue its momentum tonight against Long Beach State.

They eventually went on to snag the much-needed win, their only victory in a three-game home stand.</p>\n<p>Against Long Beach in the prior game, UCSB bounced back from a miserable 23 point first half to put up 44 in the final 20 minutes, making a run reducing a 15 point lead to just six before coming up just short. Senior guard Michael Bryson scored a team-high 23 points on 10-16 shooting in that game and currently leads the Big West with 18.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>The 49ers were led by Bibbins in that game, whose performance was called “sensational” by UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams. The 5’8” guard torched the Gauchos for 25 points on 8-12 shooting including 5-5 from three-point range, putting in a dagger layup with 2:11 to go that ended all hopes of a UCSB comeback. He leads his team with 5.3 assists per game and averages 11.4 ppg for the year.</p>\n<p>More offensive balance would be huge for a Gaucho team that has struggled to score, averaging a second-worst mark of 65.2 ppg as a team since the beginning of conference play.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, they have made a second-best 38.2 percent from three during that same stretch, suggesting they may need to rely more on their outside shooting.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Gabe Vincent has been UCSB’s top threat from deep since finding his shot in recent weeks. He ranks second in three-pointers made since the beginning of conference, making 18-42 for a 42.9 percent mark.</p>\n<p>Getting center Sam Beeler more involved deep in the paint could also prove beneficial for the Gauchos, as the 6’10” senior leads the conference by a mile with a 74.4 shooting percentage. He is coming off a perfect 12-point, 6-6 shooting night against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Other than Bibbins, the 49ers only other double-digit scorer is Nick Faust, who puts up 15.5 points and 5.5 rebounds a night. The senior guard played three seasons at Maryland, where he was one of the Terrapins’ key contributors and was named to the All-ACC Freshman team. He transferred to Long Beach in 2014 before sitting out an NCAA-mandated redshirt season last year.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will tipoff at 7:30 p.m. at Walter Pyramid in Long Beach and will be shown on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/","id":358,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[357,356,355],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 11 UCSB Spoils No. 12 CSUN’s Undefeated Streak, Play LBSU Tomorrow","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The No. 11 UCSB men's volleyball team managed to extend its winning streak to three games with its first sweep of a ranked opponent  in a 3-0 win versus No. 12 Cal State Northridge in its MPSF home op...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67692\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67692\" data-attachment-id=\"67692\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/mvball_vsnjit-20160108-dustinharris-1-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-1-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67692\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Jumping to get a high serve, Hayden Boehle returns the ball.

The win was the Gauchos’ first straight set victory against a ranked team this season.</p>\n<p>“The passing was great and the serving put pressure on them more consistently than what we’ve been doing, and if you win the serve and pass battles, the game’s usually going to go in your favor,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>The match marked the first time UCSB played in Robertson Gym since the Asics Invitational, where it finished a perfect 3-0, and McLaughlin’s team entered the match with the intent of putting its recent weeks of practice and league games on display in front of the home crowd.</p>\n<p>“We were all really excited to play here because we’ve been playing away, and we got to really showcase our talent and what we’ve been working on,” Kingi said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed vast improvements in their play, highlighted by their 24 blocks on the night, four short of their season-high against Loyola (Ill.).</p>\n<p>Kingi tallied seven kills, the third highest on the team behind Marsh, 13, and redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson, 10.</p>\n<p>“Our blocking really came together, which we’ve been practicing a lot lately, and we’ve been swinging well. We’re just fine-tuning everything,” Kingi said.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is perhaps their toughest match of the young MPSF season, a clash with No. 2 Long Beach State tomorrow. Long Beach is 3-2 in conference, 6-2 overall and will be looking to avenge yesterday’s narrow five-set loss against national No. 1 and MPSF leaders UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos split last year’s series with the 49ers 1-1, each team grabbing their wins on the road; both matches ended 3-1. In UCSB’s win, senior Ryan Hardy had a huge night, posting 10 kills and participating in nine blocks.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s match against Long Beach State will be played at Robertson Gym at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-volleyball-6/","id":5058,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5057,5056,5055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Helping Tackle the Flint Water Crisis: Detroit Lions’ Defensive End Ziggy Ansah","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"The water crisis of Flint, Michigan has negatively altered the lifestyle of nearly all of its citizens as lead continues to contaminate water sources.

In an effort to rescue the region from its lead-contaminated water crisis, Ansah assembled a crew of teammates with one goal in mind: giving back. The Former BYU Cougar donated 94,000 bottles of water to his local community as an act of relief.</p>\n<p>A city where 40 percent of its inhabitants live in poverty, Flint has suffered the brute end of this water calamity following the city’s irrigation switch from Lake Huron in Detroit to the tainted Flint River. An ongoing epidemic since April of 2014, the citizens of Flint have voiced their frustrations to Governor Rich Snyder, yet limited progress has been made.</p>\n<p>As a result, Ansah took matters in to his own hands.</p>\n<p>The Ghana native opened up about his experiences living in the continent of Africa, empathizing with the citizens of Flint and their burdens of living under harmful irrigation conditions.</p>\n<p>“Coming from Africa, I know exactly what it means to not have clean water or to not have water at all,” Ansah stated per the Free Press. “For me to be in a position where me and my [teammates] can help out these fans down here is a great honor to us.”</p>\n<p>Fellow teammates Haloti Ngata, Darryl Tapp, Gabe Wright, Jason Jones, Joique Bell, and Tennessee Titan Angelo Blackson aided Ansah with their services stocking up cases of water and transporting them to the Flint Food Bank, Brennan Park Community Center, and other local recreation centers.</p>\n<p>With help from the Lions organization, 1,680 cases of water were safely distributed to areas affected by the water crisis, exceeding Ansah’s original goal.</p>\n<p>Among others who gave back was the defensive line of the Washington Redskins, contributing 3,600 Fiji water bottles in support of Ansah’s cause. Rapper and Detroit-native Big Sean also donated $10,000 in response to his #HEALFLINTKIDS campaign.</p>\n<p>As various other professional athletes and celebrities continue to donate water in support of minimizing the Flint water crisis, each contribution is a reminder of the platform that sports, music, and individuals of other professions possess in being able to have a universal influence that extends beyond the title of their career.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_67654\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67654\" data-attachment-id=\"67654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-26/helping-tackle-the-flint-water-crisis-detroit-lions-defensive-end-ziggy-ansah/ansah/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ansah\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67654\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?resize=600%2C450\" alt=\"Ansah (red beanie) and his teammates.

Senior Nathan Eshmade, Moreno de Alboran, and freshman Oliver Sec all captured straight set victories on courts two through four, respectively, putting their team up 3-1 overall. Santa Barbara needed just one more court to take the win.</p>\n<p>Louisville would answer with two sweeps of its own on courts one and five to put the Cardinals back in striking distance at 3-3. The match came down to court six.</p>\n<p>Freshman Anders Holm faced Christian Haushammer and found himself down early, dropping the first set of the match. Despite playing with an injury to his ankle, Holm grinded to keep the second set close. His opponent took the lead and held match point twice in the second, but Holm was able to force a break and eventually take hold of the second set. The final set decided the match and Holm emerged victorious taking a convincing win in the third to give him a 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win and No. 48 Santa Barbara a 4-3 win over No. 37 Louisville.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will return home this week to make the short trip down south to Pepperdine on Sunday, Feb. 7.

We did what we had to do to get the wins.”</p>\n<p>Against Cal Baptist, McLaughlin’s team struggled to build any major momentum as it dropped the second and fourth sets. Yet, the Gauchos were led by Marsh and redshirt junior Jacob Delson, who each tallied 17 kills, along with redshirt junior libero Parker Boehle, who led the team with 11 digs.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got to give [CBU] a lot of credit,” McLaughlin said. “They definitely outplayed us those two games. They were the steadier team, and put a ton of pressure on us with great serving at key times, but our guys played their best in the final game.”</p>\n<p>Senior Jonah Seif put in a clutch serving performance in the last set, earning three-straight points for his team to give the Gauchos a comfortable 7-3 lead before eventually securing the victory. Seif has been the most consistent player for UCSB this season, notching match-high 54 assists against USC and Cal Baptist.</p>\n<p>Seif’s first big night at USC was paired with Marsh’s best match of the year as Marsh tied his career-high of 19 kills to go along with a .400 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“Against USC I was hitting pretty well and had a couple good service runs,” Marsh said. “The team as a whole brought a lot of energy, and after the set we dropped we all got more serious.”</p>\n<p>The opposite missed all but one game last year due to injury, but has been in peak form for the first four matches of MPSF play. He has averaged 3.81 kills per set since the beginning of conference play and has been reliable when the team needs improvements in its performance. Marsh registered eight kills in the third set alone against USC, helping lead the Gauchos after their loss in the previous set.</p>\n<p>“As a team we have to finish what we started,” Marsh said. “We came out strong and then struggled in the set we lost, but it’s great to pick up a couple road wins.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has now played against each of the four bottom ranked teams in the MPSF, but will face the tougher part of its schedule in the following week tougher set of matches. Marsh and company will be looking to defend their home court against undefeated no. 12 CSUN Wednesday, Jan. 27. The Gauchos then move onto No. 2 Long Beach State Friday, Jan. 29, who were handed their first loss of the season on Friday by No. 3 BYU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67596\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67596\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsb-improves-to-4-1-in-mpsf-standings-with-wins-over-no-15-usc-and-cal-baptist/","id":5057,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5056,5055,5054],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 Gauchos Close Out Winter Invitational at 3-2, Losses to No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-2-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling to No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal, the UCSB women's water polo team finished its Winter Invitational with a 3-2 record.

With only 27 seconds left in the period, sophomore driver Carla Carraga tied the score for the Golden Bears with a short-range shot.</p>\n<p>Cal then went on a 2-0 run to take the lead for the first time in the game. After a timeout called by the Gauchos, junior utility Miranda Schrader put it in the back of the net to tie the game up 2-2 before going into half time.</p>\n<p>In the third period, the Gauchos claimed the lead once again off of a foul transition. The game went back and forth as Cal evened the score at the 4:10 mark only to be answered by Martin’s backhand scoring play, putting the Gauchos in the lead 5-4.</p>\n<p>As the battle continued, UCSB was able to contain the Bears’ offense until the last seven seconds of regulation when Carrega tied the match sending it into overtime.</p>\n<p>The first period of overtime went on scoreless, and it wasn’t until the 1:31 mark of the second period when the Bears found the winning goal by junior driver Genevieive Weed.</p>\n<p>On the second day of the tournament, the Gauchos played Cal Baptist in the afternoon with junior utility Taylor Shore, senior attacker Bryn Hudson and Martin each scoring two goals each.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense remained strong as it held off the Lancers, keeping them scoreless until midway of the second quarter, which by that point the Gauchos were already up 5-0. At the 4:42 mark Cal Baptist scored its first goal of the match, but was quickly answered by freshman utility Sarah Kreiser to maintain the five-point lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Lancers scored two more in the fourth quarter to shorten the lead 9-4, the Gauchos put one more away to end the game in a 10-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Later that night, UCSB faced its toughest competitor of the tournament, the UCLA Bruins. Despite having scored first, the Gauchos were not able to maintain its lead as the Bruins went on a 5-0 unanswered scoring streak.</p>\n<p>“I think we are countering well and we got good patience, something to improve on is reacting quicker on defense,” Kay said postgame.</p>\n<p>The first quarter ended with UCLA on top 3-1, which carried its momentum into the second quarter scoring within the period’s first minute. Although the Gauchos had the opportunity to strike back, they did not capitalize on the two back-to-back offensive fouls committed by the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Following the second period, the Gauchos managed to score two more goals, reducing their deficit to 6-3 to which the Bruins reacted quickly.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s efforts to catch up, UCLA did not give up the three-point lead ending the game 8-5 with a victory for the Bruins.</p>\n<p>“It is always fun to play against UCLA for me, those were my glory days and it is always a blast,” Kay said after facing her alma mater.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos wrapped up its Winter Invitational with a sweep over No.21 UCSD and No.20 Wagner.</p>\n<p>The Tritons were looking to finish the weekend with a perfect record in the first game of the day. However, after an intense seesaw game the Gauchos spoiled it for UCSD finishing on top 10-9.</p>\n<p>Both teams came out slow in the first quarter, and couldn’t seem to find the net. The Tritons opened up the board with a goal at the 5:26 mark to which the Gauchos counter attacked and scored a point to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Things got going in the second quarter as both teams scored a couple of goals, finishing the first half of the game with UCSB leading 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was an exciting fourth quarter in which the Tritons would fight back and tie the game on three separate occasions. Two of these were penalty shots from Alexia Wieseler.</p>\n<p>Unable to surpass a one-point lead, UCSB was aware of the importance to keep possession of the ball for as long as it could. After Schrader tallied a goal, the Gauchos held on to the ball and let the clock run to end the game with a close win over the Tritons.</p>\n<p>Despite a long weekend, the Gauchos remained focused and strong in their last game against Wagner. Great work on both ends of the pool helped defeat the Seahawks, 10-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not lose any time and put away two scores within the first minute and a half. The biggest lead came in the third quarter as the Gauchos held Wagner down 7-2.<br>\nAfter that, the Gauchos did not allow the Seahawks to get closer than three points.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a season-high of 15 saves during the game while Shore ended the day as UCSB’s leading scorer with five goals. Martin had six ejections total and three steals to contribute to the Gauchos’ total of 15.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with the team’s performance,” Kay said. “I really think we are playing with the best, but we still have a lot of areas to polish up, like technical skills and simple awareness.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their season on the road, as they head to Ann Arbor for the Michigan Invitational this upcoming weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/","id":5011,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5010,5009,5008],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Three-Game Streak Ends in 92-81 Loss at UCR, 4-2 in Big West Standings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-5-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With first-place in the Big West standings on the line, the UCSB women's basketball team was unable to extend its three-game winning streak after a 92-81 loss to UC Riverside on Saturday.

Yet, the Highlanders dominated the paint by outrebounding UCSB 36-19, a season-low for UCSB, and outscored the Gauchos in the paint 44-30.</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders’ interior offense was Rejane Verin. The redshirt junior forward justified her third selection as Big West Player of the Week nearly finishing with a triple-double. Verin registered a game-high 25 points, 16 rebounds and led UCR in assists with seven.</p>\n<p>Four of the Highlanders’ starters finished with double-figures in scoring. In addition to Verin and Curry, senior guards Brittany Crain and Annelise Ito added to UCR nearly matching its season-high of 93 points. Despite just six points in the first half, Crain ended with 23 points while Ito notched 17 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>Riverside’s control of the post became even more advantageous in getting to the free-throw line in which it finished 23-25. UCSB was efficient at the free-throw line as well, but had less attempts making 13-16.</p>\n<p>UCR finished with 10 free-throw attempts in the first quarter, but it was the early production of 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year Michelle Curry that helped the Highlanders gain a double-figure lead. She scored nine of her 15 total points in the opening quarter, making half of the Highlanders’ free-throw attempts as Riverside took an 18-8 lead.</p>\n<p>Ware helped UCSB rally from its 10-point deficit, scoring the Gauchos’ last two field goals from beyond the arc to trim UCR’s lead to 26-21 to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>Neither team could score a basket to open the second quarter as the two registered just one field goal apiece through nearly four minutes of play. Yet, the scoring outburst of Jemerigbe and freshman guard Coco Miller helped UCSB stay within a close margin of the Highlanders’ lead.</p>\n<p>The two accounted for eight of Santa Barbara’s last nine field goals, combining for 16 of the Gauchos’ total of 20 points in the quarter on 7-10 shooting from the field. Miller concluded Saturday’s contest with 18 points while shooting 7-15, 4-10 from behind the three-point line to go along with two steals. Still, UCSB entered halftime down 41-47.</p>\n<p>Riverside increased its lead to 10 in the early minutes of the second half. But a 9-2 UCSB run brought the Gauchos within three at 50-53, forcing a UCR timeout. Santa Barbara came as close as a one-point deficit at 56-57, but could not prevent UCR’s 12-2 run to close out the third quarter with a 69-58 lead.</p>\n<p>After a made free-throw by junior forward Inara Nyingifa, UCR earned its largest lead of 17 points at 78-61. A total of 10 points from Ware helped UCSB in its comeback attempts as a three-pointer by Miller with 4:08 remaining in regulation trimmed the Gauchos’ deficit to seven at 73-80.</p>\n<p>However, the scoring duo of Crain and Verin helped UCR secure its victory as the two combined for 18 points and three steals helping lead the Highlanders to their 92-81 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its road stint with a game at UC Davis on Saturday, Jan. 30 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/","id":356,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[355,354,353],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":89,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
