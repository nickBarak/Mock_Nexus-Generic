The Gauchos will have to win their six remaining games to do so.</p>\n<p>Already in desperation mode entering the game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts opted for a pitching change in the first inning after sophomore starting pitcher Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s 2-0 lead on a RBI groundout and a homerun.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter/relief pitcher Greg Mahle came in to stop the bleeding, but not before he ran into trouble in the fourth inning.</p>\n<p>With UCSB down by a run, Mahle allowed the runner on second base to score on a double down the left field line, forcing Checketts to make another pitching change.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine began separating itself from there on despite sophomore closer Dillon Tate taking over on the mound. The right-hander salvaged the inning by allowing only one more batter to cross the plate on a wild pitch. However, Pepperdine extended its lead to 6-2.</p>\n<p>The game got even uglier for the Gauchos after that. After the Waves managed only one run on a bases-loaded situation in the fifth inning, they broke the game completely open in the next three innings.</p>\n<p>Senior relief pitcher Cameron Cuneo took over in the sixth and loaded the bases with one out. Cuneo then walked the next batter before Checketts made another call to the pen.</p>\n<p>The move did not pay off as the next batter also walked with the bases loaded. In total, the Waves earned two runs on only one hit in that inning.</p>\n<p>While UCSB attempted to find the right combination on the mound, the Waves’ sophomore starting pitcher Jackson McClelland was in complete control of his game.</p>\n<p>Through six innings of work, McClelland allowed only two runs on five hits, striking out seven batters and walking only two to improve his record to 7-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put an end to its scoring drought in the top half of the seventh with a three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic had an infield single with the bases loaded and two outs to earn the first run and junior right fielder Cameron Newell hit a two-run single to tack on more runs for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine put a stamp to the game in the bottom half of the inning with a two-run homerun that pushed its run total into the double-digit range. With one more run in the eighth, the Waves finished the game with a total of 12 runs.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did have standout performances from two of its players. Junior shortstop Peter Maris hit 2-5 and Nesovic went 2-4 from the plate and one of three Gauchos to earn at least one RBI in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays again this weekend against San Francisco in a non-conference series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 14, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55296\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55296\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/","id":4431,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4430,4429,4428],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Staying Atop the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensSoccerPeterVandenbelt-e1411164336940.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensSoccerPeterVandenbelt-e1411164336940.jpg?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Hopes to Win Conference For Second Straight Year by Bringing in a Crop of New Freshmen.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s soccer team finished this season with a loss to Penn State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament after capturing the regular season Big West Conference title.

I believe this is the first year where we have a recruiting class that does not have a transfer on it.”</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB adds three forwards, four midfielders, three defenders and a goalkeeper for a recruiting class that is ranked No. 8 in the nation by Top Drawer Soccer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’d be excited as a fan of Gaucho soccer. Come see the MLS players today before they show up tomorrow, and you’re going to see a lot of that over the next couple of years,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year’s conference freshman of the year will come from this recruiting class.”</p>\n<p><strong>Forwards</strong></p>\n<p>Highlighting the forward class is Sacramento native Dalton Pando, who played club ball with the San Jose Earthquake Academy of the USSF. Pando was ranked No. 50 in Top Drawer Soccer’s top 150 academy players while also receiving the rank of No. 19 forward in the nation and No. 4 player from Northern California Region.</p>\n<p>Also coming from the San Jose Earthquake Academy is forward Alex Liua. The Los Altos native paired with Pando to form a dangerous attack for the Earthquake and will look to continue that next season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the forwards is Denis Kalamar of Seattle. Kalamar played for the Seattle Sounders Academy for three years and received a Top Drawer Soccer No. 10 ranking in the Pacific Northwest Region for his play.</p>\n<p>“I think a player like Adonis, like Kalamar, Pando, those are attacking players that can go onto a field and change it,” Vom Steeg said. “Alex is another player who attacks. Any of the guys who attack will have an opportunity to play for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Midfielders</strong></p>\n<p>Three players from the L.A. Galaxy Academy headline the midfield group of the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Adonis Amaya is the highest rated prospect coming in for the Gauchos as he received a No. 15 academy rating, No. 5 midfielder rating and a No. 4 rating in the Southern California Region. Amaya played defender for the U-17 U.S. National team and forward for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Fellow Galaxy Academy player Axel Mendez joins the Gauchos as the No. 32 ranked prospect out of the Southern California Region, according to Top Drawer Soccer. Mendez brings an attacking style of play to the midfield position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The first player that we got to commit from this whole group was actually Axel Mendez,” Vom Steeg said. “Axel is unique to us because we haven’t really had a playmaker out of midfield. He has a real opportunity to contribute right away because of the position he plays.”</p>\n<p>Ryo Fujii also comes from the Galaxy Academy ranking No. 147 in the nation from the USSF Academy system. Fujii, a native of Torrance also ranks No. 21 in Southern California and is the No. 51 midfielder in the nation.</p>\n<p>Ludwig Ahl is one of two international prospects in this season’s recruiting class hailing from Stockholm, Sweden. Ahl played for AIK Stockholm in Sweden’s top amateur league and was considered for the Swedish National Team.</p>\n<p>“In the past, you’d be lucky to find one freshman starting at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year, there’s a chance that we can have eight or nine freshman or sophomores starting on the field. I would be really surprised if at least three freshman didn’t start for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Defenders</strong></p>\n<p>The other international player is Julian Busch from Eichenau, Germany where he played for 1860 Munich. Busch played in the U-17 Bundesliga, the top amateur league in Germany against formidable competition from all over Europe.</p>\n<p>“We feel like the international players are a little more mature,” Vom Steeg said. “Those are players that you think can contribute right away because they’re 20 (years old) and once again they have played at a high level.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will add a bit of east coast flair in Dugan Zier of New York. Zier played for the New York Red Bulls Academy and is one of eight USSF Academy players in the Gauchos recruiting class.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final player hailing from the Galaxy Academy is Jeff Quezada. Quezada was team captain for the Galaxy Academy during his time there and played alongside the trio of midfielders in addition to current UCSB players Josh McNeely and Drew Murphy. All six players won a USSF National Title with the Galaxy Academy in 2011.</p>\n<p>“We’re really high on Jeff Quezada. He’s got the respect of his team, he’s the captain of one of the top teams in the country, but again, he plays a really difficult position,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s going to have a great career here at UCSB, but because of the position he plays, there’s a big, huge learning curve there.”</p>\n<p><strong>Goalkeeper</strong></p>\n<p>Brandon Berke of De Anza Force SC rounds out the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Berke will most likely play backup to McNeely this season but provides the Gauchos with solid depth at the goalkeeper position.</p>\n<p>With 11 new players joining an already talented and young squad, the Gauchos look to have a bright future atop the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>“We’ve really recruited the right type of kids with the right attitudes. I can’t say enough about these players that had the opportunity to go elsewhere; not only other colleges but obviously [they] do what they really want to do at some point, which is be a pro player, but instead they chose to play here at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “That is the attitude that will take us really far because I think players will be really committed to the team and committed to having a successful season.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 15, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55294\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55294\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/","id":1575,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1574,1573,1572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Fails to Capture First League Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos fall 2-1 to Long Beach State in the final series of the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Shelby Wisdom crouched down on the pitcher’s mound and mumbled something to herself, clearly frustrated and disappointed.</p>\n<p>The junior had just given up a grand slam and the eighth run of the inning to Long Beach State.

Long Beach improves to 38-17 overall and 15-6 in conference, winning its seventh league title.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara didn’t come away with the victory, it was a record-breaking year in many ways. UCSB ends its season with the highest win percentage (.630) in program history and tied the record for most wins in a single season in program history.</p>\n<p>Individually, Wisdom becomes the first Gaucho to record consecutive 20-plus win seasons and now owns the record for most wins in a single season for a pitcher with 63, finishing at 22-15 on the year. Freshman left fielder Kristen Clark also shattered the single season hit record of 75 against Hawaii, finishing the year with 90 hits. She also broke the single season batting average of .417 with a .437 average.</p>\n<p>However, the one record that mattered most for UCSB was winning its first ever Big West title, and the Gauchos didn’t get the job done.</p>\n<p>“From the start, we talked about the Big West [Championship] and being there in the end. No one really thought we could be there in the end,” senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil said. “We came up a little short and they were just a little more clutch than we were.”</p>\n<p>The Big West crown came down to the final day of the regular season after Santa Barbara evened the series at one, thanks to a five-run fourth inning.</p>\n<p>Winning 6-3, sophomore catcher Meme Moore anchored the Gauchos offensively, hitting 1-2 with three RBI. Brucelas also went 3-3 at the plate with one run and one RBI while Wisdom hit 1-2 with two runs. Wisdom finished the weekend with four runs and two RBI on 4-7 hitting, including 2-3 with two runs and two RBI in Saturday’s critical rubber game.</p>\n<p>“The second game they played a lot looser. In general, they had better-quality at bats,” Galicinao said. “Long Beach even pulled ahead in that second game, but we were able to punch right back. All the way to the last pitch, you can’t ever count this group out.”</p>\n<p>Game one, on the other hand, swung Long Beach’s way as Santa Barbara gave up four home runs and fell 7-5.</p>\n<p>“Long Beach is a really good hitting team and when you throw it in their wheelhouse, the chances are they’re going to hit it pretty hard,” Galicinao said. “Being the series that it was, [Shelby] was amped up, throwing a little bit harder. They took advantage.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 12th, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55268\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55268\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/","id":1094,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1093,1092,1091],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Stays Local With Recruits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WaterPoloEricSwenson.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WaterPoloEricSwenson.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Shane Hauschild headlines the UCSB men's water polo recruiting class for the 2014 season.

Jarvis will play center for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He is a really strong and physical player as well,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>The last confirmed incoming freshman for the Gaucho squad is Josh Jordan from Sacramento. Jordan is the younger brother of junior utility Nick Jordan.</p>\n<p>“He is a very versatile player, so he will help us a lot,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>UCSB also plans to welcome back senior utility Chase Racich, who played on the team his freshman year in 2011.</p>\n<p>Other than losing assistant coach John Abdou to USA Water Polo, the Gauchos 2014 season is looking to be similar to the last. Finishing last season 17-11 overall, UCSB looks to make progress from last year’s growth and improve on its seventh-place finish in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We really are going to be a deeper team,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55261\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55261\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/","id":5066,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5065,5064,5063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Beat CSUN in Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos' playoff hopes in danger after failing to sweep CSUN.

Freshman starting pitcher Shane Bieber managed to escape the inning, but the damage was done for UCSB. The Gauchos manufactured only one run in the sixth inning on a RBI hit by sophomore designated hitter/pitcher Greg Mahle.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t ready to go defensively and then we couldn’t adjust offensively later,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “They weren’t flat. They had energy, but their concentration level probably wasn’t where it needed to be.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone’s complete-game shutout on Saturday clinched the series for the Gauchos as the team won 6-0. The right-hander delivered his best outing of the season, facing only 30 batters and throwing 85 pitches to pick up the win and improve to 3-1 on the year.</p>\n<p>“He had everything working today. He hit all his spots and when he does that he’s pretty unhittable,” senior left fielder Joey Epperson said. “The fastball was coming out of his hand well. He did a good job of being deceptive at times and throwing pitches where he wants in the strike zone.”</p>\n<p>UCSB led 2-0 in the eighth inning before adding four big insurance runs to extend its lead. After junior right fielder Cameron Newell scored from second base on a throwing error, the top half of Santa Barbara’s lineup capitalized on senior relief pitcher Michael Coates’s poor outing on the mound.</p>\n<p>Coates allowed two runs on a RBI triple by Maris and a double by Epperson, which drove Coates out of the game. Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic capped off the inning with a single to bring Epperson home.<br>\nSanta Barbara previously scored two runs in the fourth inning on a two-run homerun by Epperson. With a runner on second base, Epperson smashed the ball opposite-field for his fourth homer on the year and first since March 16.</p>\n<p>“In that situation, mainly I was just trying put the barrel to the baseball and find a way to get that run in,” Epperson said. “And I wound up taking a good swing on the ball and it left the yard. With Pettibone pitching that was really all we needed.”</p>\n<p>In the first game of the series on Friday, the Gauchos’ four runs in the third inning was just enough, with the final score ending 4-3 in favor of UCSB. Newell singled to get the third inning started for the Gauchos and scored two outs later on a hit to the left side by Maris.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s senior pitcher Brycen Rutherford followed the Maris single by loading the bases, setting the stage for a two-run RBI hit from Nesovic. Freshman center fielder Andrew Calica singled one more time in the inning to give UCSB a 4-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara’s lineup gave UCSB the lead, Mahle’s versatility in the batter’s box and on the mound proved to be the difference in the game. After sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome gave up three runs in the sixth inning, Mahle came in relief with the bases loaded and pitched out of the jam to maintain UCSB’s lead.</p>\n<p>Mahle filled the stat sheet on the day. From the plate, Mahle went 2-3 with a walk and a run scored. His two innings pitched in relief secured the lead before sophomore closer Dillon Tate came on in the eighth and ninth inning to close the door on the Matadors.</p>\n<p>UCSB is back in action Tuesday against Pepperdine. The game is of critical importance in terms of UCSB qualifying for the NCAA tournament, given that the Waves are the last opponent the Gauchos will face with an RPI of above 40. Teams with an RPI above 40 have a considerable shot at earning an at-large bid, and as of now, Santa Barbara has an RPI of 52.</p>\n<p>First pitch tomorrow is set for 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 12, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55266\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55266\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/","id":4432,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4431,4430,4429],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Long Beach State With NCAA Tournament Berth at the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-09.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-09.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB battles Long Beach State as both teams are tied atop the Big West Conference standings entering the last week of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The long-awaited showdown is finally here.</p>\n<p>The top two teams in the Big West square off this weekend at Campus Diamond in a battle for the Big West Championship and a ticket to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>For the UCSB softball team, the math is simple.

It’s our last weekend at home and it’s our last series in conference, so we’re going to play with our hearts and go all out. We just to have to know that we’re better and that we can do it.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach travels to Santa Barbara at 36-16 overall and 13-5 in conference. Third-place Cal Poly also figures into the mix, just one game behind both the Gauchos and 49ers. The Mustangs play last-place UC Riverside this weekend.</p>\n<p>While both Santa Barbara and CSULB stand atop the standings, it is the Gauchos that carry the momentum as winners of 12 of their last 14 games. UCSB will also have the advantage of playing at home for its seniors with Senior Day on Sunday. Long Beach, on the other hand, was swept by Cal Poly last weekend to lose control of its lead in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We’re all really excited. Even at practice today, we had a big team talk about how we want to see our name on that selection show on Sunday,” junior third baseman Jenessa Jeppesen said. “We have to take it one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>After sweeping Riverside last weekend, sophomore catcher Meme Moore was named Big West Field Player of the Week. Moore had an incredible series, tallying a slugging percentage of .800 and a batting average of .600. In the series finale, she hit 4-4 with two runs and two RBI. Moore is currently tied for first in the Big West in doubles with 13.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, Wisdom was on her game as well, as she gave up just three earned runs in the circle while hitting 6-10 from the plate with three runs and one RBI on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>At 21-13, Wisdom is approaching an important milestone this weekend. Currently tied with Sandy Ortigies for most career wins at 62, Wisdom could etch her name into the UCSB record books with a win against Long Beach. Ortigies’ record has stood since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, the record doesn’t really matter to me unless we get those two wins,” Wisdom said. “I’m only a win away and that one win won’t matter. We need [two].”</p>\n<p>One thing these two teams have in common is that offense can come from anyone. Last weekend, the Gauchos’ offensive success was a team effort. In game one, for example, seven of 10 players in the Santa Barbara lineup got a hit and five had at least two hits.</p>\n<p>One of Santa Barbara’s biggest offensive weapons is freshman left fielder Kristen Clark, who leads the league in batting average (.432) and in hits (83). The lead-off hitter leads the league in hits by a large margin with the second-ranked player with 67, 16 less than Clark. Two weekends ago against Hawaii, she broke the single-season UCSB hits record previously owned by Assistant Coach Christine Ramos.</p>\n<p>“It helps a lot when we get our bunts down and move runners around,” Wisdom said. “Hitting is contagious, so once one person gets a hit, the next person can get a hit easier.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ success also relies on offensive production from multiple players. Senior second baseman Cya Neal is tied for third in the Big West in runs and ranks fifth in hits, while sophomore left fielder Darian Tautalafua sits in fifth in conference in runs. Furthermore, junior shortstop Shayna Kimbrough ranks fourth in conference in hits and third in batting average. Teammate and senior right fielder Sarah Carrasco is tied for first with Meme Moore in doubles. Senior catcher Karli Sandoval and senior first baseman Ashlynn Booker sit in third and fifth in league in RBI, respectively. Booker also ranks sixth in home runs.</p>\n<p>As a team, Long Beach leads the league in runs, hits, RBI, batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>“They can read the defense well, so we need to make sure we don’t let them read us,” Wisdom said. “[Long Beach wants] exactly what we want, so they’re going to come out and compete and we need to be ready for it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, senior Erin Jones-Wesley is LBSU’s top-pitcher. Her ERA of 2.96 ranks third in the Big West. UCSB, meanwhile, will counter with Wisdom, who ranks fifth at 3.17.</p>\n<p>The 49ers also have depth in their bullpen and will look to junior Amanda Hansen as well, who ranks just behind Wisdom in ERA at 3.17.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing for us is taking it one pitch at a time,” Jeppesen said. “We need to not get too excited and stay composed and play our best.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for noon tomorrow. After tomorrow’s double-header, the series will wrap up Saturday with game three beginning at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55214\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55214\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/","id":1069,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1068,1067,1066],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Matadors for Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-01.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-01.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB plays in its final home series of the season against CSUN.

Santa Barbara began the year with its second-best start in program history at 18-3 and ranked as high as No. 10. Since then, however, UCSB has been in a tail-spin, losing four of six conference series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos reached their low point of the season last weekend when they were swept by first-place UC Irvine in a series critical for Big West positioning. Before Tuesday’s win at Bakersfield, UCSB was held from winning its previous four games, the longest stretch the team had gone without winning this season.</p>\n<p>A big reason for UCSB’s struggles has been a lack of quality innings from its starting pitching. Against the Anteaters, Santa Barbara starting pitching combined to allow 12 runs in 12.1 innings of work, while the bullpen gave up a total of five runs in 10.5 innings of relief.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Gauchos’ relief pitching has been the most consistent facet of this year’s team. Despite giving up a late lead to UCI last weekend in the second game of the series, the bullpen had previously pitched the Gauchos into having a 20-0 record when leading after the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>The duo of sophomore relief pitchers Greg Mahle and Dillon Tate have provided a solid tandem in the back end of the bullpen for UCSB. Besides their reliability, the two have been workhorses for the team. Mahle ranks first in conference appearances by a pitcher with 13 and is coming off his longest outing where he pitched six shutout innings of two-hit ball in the series finale against Irvine.</p>\n<p>Mahle’s standout year has taken a backseat to Tate’s own outstanding season. Tate is second behind Mahle in conference appearances by a pitcher with 11 and after pitching three scoreless innings against Bakersfield, he lowered his ERA to 0.55. The shutdown closer has allowed just one earned run in 21 of his 22 outings this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also need to put more runs on the board against a team that ranks second to last in the conference in ERA at 3.64. Recently, junior shortstop Peter Maris has been the best hitter for the Gauchos. In his last eight games he has hit .362, including collecting three hits and two RBI against CSUB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has done significantly better at home than on the road and will look to take advantage of the Matadors’ troubles away from home. CSUN is 5-17 on the road.</p>\n<p>Aside from home field advantage, the team will also honor four of its seniors for Senior Day, including starting catcher Jackson Morrow and left fielder Joey Epperson, who leads the team with a .384 batting average.</p>\n<p>First game of the series is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of  </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/","id":4430,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4429,4428,4427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings in 10 Talented Freshmen for Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos bring in young crop of forwards, defenders and goalkeepers for 2014 season.

Brittney McKinney from Chaminade Prep in Woodland Hills, CA, is a player with a knack of putting the ball on frame and finished within the top 10 in her high school’s scoring list.</p>\n<p>Jordan Alves from Mary Star of the Sea High School can play in the forward and center midfielder position and can provide some versatility in the position. The San Pedro, CA native is in the discussion for possibly earning playing time in her first year. Recently committed Zoe Purcell from Torrey Pines High School, will add another option at the forward position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have not done a great job of scoring many goals the last couple of years,” Stumpf said. “We specifically went after some goal scorers that we thought were going to help us right away.”</p>\n<p>Defense, the strongest suit for UCSB last season, will lose three key leaders. The departure of Taylor Gehring and the Gankema twins, Paige and Lindsay, will most likely be filled by returning players, says Stumpf.</p>\n<p>However, Chace Schornstein from Redwood High School has potential to battle for a starting role, along with Kate Shoemaker from Poway High School in San Diego. The two use their size and physicality to keep the ball away from attackers.</p>\n<p>Despite a breakout season from junior Beth Ritter in between the goal posts last year, the Gauchos welcome three recruits in goalkeeping that can potentially threaten Ritter’s starting role. At 5’8”, Hannah Frogge from Bishop McGuinness High School in Oklahoma has the ideal frame for a goalkeeper and has athleticism to go with it. She had an impressive 90 percent save percentage her senior year.</p>\n<p>Remi White from Monte Vista High School and Brittney Rogers out of Murrieta Valley High School will also be in the goalkeeper rotation.</p>\n<p>“[Frogge is] going to come in and she’s going to challenge the two returning keepers pretty much right away in goal,” Stumpf said. “The other two goal keepers coming in — Remi White and Brittney Rogers — most likely, an educated guess will tell me they’re going to be backups at least their first years.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/","id":1572,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1571,1570,1569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Add Six Freshmen to Roster","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensVolleyball4PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensVolleyball4PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=410%2C597&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has big shoes to fill with the departures of several key seniors.

After her senior season at St. Lucy’s Priory High School, Bast earned All-CIF honors and was named the San Gabriel Valley Tribune Player of the Year. With four league titles and two CIF Championships throughout high school, her history of winning is something that can surely help the Gauchos as they look to repeat as Big West champs.</p>\n<p>“Sydney is a really consistent player and we noticed that she has the skills as both a passer and a defender,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>Coming into the team at 5’8”, Kelly Bielaski is the tallest of the three new liberos. During her time at Dougherty Valley High School, Bielaski set the school records for career kills, digs and aces on her way to earning two Offensive Player of the Year awards and being named MVP after her senior year.</p>\n<p>“What really stood out from [Kelly] was her passing ability,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s a really bright kid and I think that can translate well to the court.”</p>\n<p>The last of the three liberos is Jane Lamp from Thousand Oaks High School. At just 5’3”, Lamp helped lead her team to three consecutive undefeated seasons in league play and was named the team’s Best Defensive Player in her junior year. In each of her last two high school seasons, Lamp was named to the All-Marmonte League First Team as well as the All-Ventura County team.</p>\n<p>“Jane’s a go-getter. She’s not going to let her small stature get in her way,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s a really energetic, fiery player and just brings a lot of energy to the court.”</p>\n<p>Adding offensive firepower will be outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. Hoffman finished her high school career with a Riverside County record of 1,338 kills and earned numerous postseason awards including Div. II Player of the Year and All-CIF Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Chanel is an all-around player and she’s going to have an opportunity to impact the game in both the front row and the back row,” Lantagne Welch said. “One of her strengths is her ability to do so many things well.”</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB’s good young group of middle blockers and outside hitters is 6’3” Megan Sullivan. After leading the way in her senior year with an impressive .353 hitting percentage, she was named to the Delta River All-League team and the Sacramento Bee All-Metro team.</p>\n<p>“Megan is a high-touching player,” Lantagne Welch said. “Just to get another good athlete in the program that’s playing a high level along the net is going to help our team tremendously.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the new recruits is setter/right-side hitter Noa Nightingale. A teammate of Sullivan’s in high school, Nightingale was listed in PrepVolleyball’s Players to Watch and Seniors Aces list as she went for 197 kills in her senior year without missing a start.</p>\n<p>“Noa gives us a lot of depth and flexibility,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s really going to have some different looks depending on how everyone shapes out in the positions and whatnot. She’s a really hard worker and we’re excited about her versatility.”</p>\n<p>Last season, UCSB utilized numerous freshmen on its way to a Big West league title. These freshmen will have the same opportunity to make an immediate impact.</p>\n<p>“We’re not afraid to play freshmen,” Lantagne Welch said. “Our freshmen have been great in this program in the past so whoever earns it and can help us win the most is going to be out there on the floor.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/","id":5243,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5242,5241,5240],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Same Blood, Same Team, Opposite Personalities","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball-sisters.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball-sisters.jpg?resize=610%2C450&ssl=1","description":"Sisters DeJanee and Meme Moore Work Together For UCSB, Bringing Different Styles to the Field.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Taking a quick glance at the UCSB softball roster, you might notice there are two players with the last name of Moore.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, you’re not seeing double.

No one really gets to say they’ve played with their sister at the DI level.”</p>\n<p>The two are nearly inseparable. Not only do they go to school and play together, but they live together as well.</p>\n<p>“There’s only one time we’ve been apart and that’s when I was a senior in high school and she was a freshman in college,” Meme said. “That was actually really hard for me because she’s always been with me. For the first week she was gone, I slept in her bed.”</p>\n<p>As Sacramento natives, DeJanee and Meme have played softball together their entire lives and in 2011, won a Sac-Joaquin Section Division I Championship together at Sheldon High School.</p>\n<p>“I think we batted back-to-back (in high school), so it was the Moore duo,” DeJanee said. “It was cool to share that moment with her. [Playing together isn’t] new to us. Over the years, we’ve gotten closer. I don’t think when we were younger we liked it very much.”</p>\n<p>The sisters even committed to UCSB at the same time, deciding to play softball in Santa Barbara when DeJanee was 15 and Meme was 14.</p>\n<p>“She wanted to go to the same school as me, but I [originally] didn’t, being with her all the time,” Meme said. “Plus, we committed early, so we weren’t as close as we are now. I wanted to go to a different school and branch out and get my space, but it worked out.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite their closeness and genetics, the Moore sisters have very different personalities and are extremely different players.</p>\n<p>“Their personalities are so different; that’s what makes it even more fun,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They live together and to hear them talk with each other, there’s a mutual respect and love, but they also give each other a hard time. It’s fun to see.”</p>\n<p>DeJanee is energetic and the leader of the two sisters while Meme is more calm and laid-back.</p>\n<p>Their personality differences are exhibited through their choice of majors too. DeJanee is a communication major while Meme is pursing art.</p>\n<p>“I can remember back to when they came to one of our camps. They had already committed and this was the first time really working them,” Galicinao said. “I think Dej was at third and Meme was at shortstop and [DeJanee] was on [Meme] about not talking enough. She was like, ‘You need to be talking loud enough. Coach Brie wants someone who’s loud.’ And [Meme] just looked at her and was like, ‘See how mean she is to me?’ It was funny.”</p>\n<p>These differences also translate onto the softball field. Meme will be found behind home plate as Santa Barbara’s catcher while DeJanee is listed as a utility player for UCSB, mostly playing different positions in the infield.</p>\n<p>DeJanee is known as a quicker player offensively, ranking second on the team in on-base percentage. She is often used as a designated hitter for the Gauchos as well.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Meme is more of a power-hitter, ranking second on the team in runs, third on team in hits and leading the team in doubles. This past week, Meme was named Big West Field Player of the Week after posting an .800 slugging percentage, .600 batting average and four runs in UCSB’s sweep over UC Riverside. She also hit 4-4 in Sunday’s game to clinch the series and move into a tie with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“Meme is a more relaxed player,” DeJanee said. “She’s super calm and I’m a person that gets really nervous and anxious. We’re totally opposites, especially hitting.”</p>\n<p>While siblings who are on the same team have the potential to create drama, playing different positions has allowed the Moore sisters to avoid any rivalry.</p>\n<p>“I just remember the one time my child ball coach tried to make my sister a catcher,” Meme said. “I was like, ‘No. She can’t play my position.’”</p>\n<p>Playing the same position didn’t last long. DeJanee quickly returned to the infield, allowing the Moore sisters to support each other in a way only a sibling bond can. With such different personalities, DeJanee and Meme play off each other well. They know how to support and complement each other on the field.</p>\n<p>“We know each other the best, so when I tell her something, it’s because I know what she’s doing and I know I can help her,” DeJanee said. “That’s what I like about having my sister on the team. She knows me and she’s that person I can go to no matter what.”</p>\n<p>This weekend, UCSB has the opportunity to win a Big West Championship. Building off the Moore sisters’ energy and belief in each other might just give UCSB the edge it needs to take it all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photos by Dustin Harris and Anna Kodelashvili of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/","id":1068,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1067,1066,1065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Surge Pushes UCSB to Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Four runs in the eighth inning propelled the Gauchos to a 7-3 win over Cal State Bakersfield.

With the bases still loaded, senior left fielder Joey Epperson grounded out to score the runner from third and the next hitter, junior shortstop Peter Maris, doubled down the right field line to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to four runs.</p>\n<p>Sophomore relief pitcher Dillon Tate took over from there for the Gauchos. The right-hander had an easy 1-2-3 inning in the bottom of the eighth and quickly took care of business in the final inning by retiring the side in order. Tate pitched three innings of relief in total and gave up only one hit.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield had originally put the game in a deadlock in the sixth inning as sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza ran out of gas towards the end of his start. A single by the Roadrunners followed by a groundout advanced the runner to second base and into scoring position.</p>\n<p>Needing just one more out to escape the threat, Mazza allowed another single to put the game at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The game-tying run ended a three-inning scoring drought by both sides. Santa Barbara previously led 3-2 by scoring two runs on three hits and an error in the second inning. Epperson had an RBI single and Morrow later scored from third base on a pass ball.</p>\n<p>In the first inning, UCSB took the lead by tacking a run on a two-out RBI by junior designated hitter Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has had an impressive year pitching from the bullpen, was in the lineup in Tuesday’s game and singled through the right side to send Maris home from second base. Maris had previously doubled in his at-bat.</p>\n<p>The lead was short-lived as Bakersfield took the lead with two runs in the bottom half of the inning. With runners on first and second base, Mazza picked off the runner from first but allowed a triple to the next batter to tie the game at one apiece. Mazza gave up another extra-base hit before the inning ended to give CSUB a 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>UCSB now turns to this weekend when it will play Cal State Northridge for the final three-game set at home starting Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55180\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55180\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/","id":4419,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4418,4417,4416],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Three Straight in Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/baseball21.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/baseball21.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are in sixth place with six Big West games remaining.

Santa Barbara previously had a 19-0 record when leading after six innings, but sophomore closer Dillon Tate allowed the game-winning single to the first batter he faced in the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB held Irvine scoreless entering the seventh inning up by two runs until UCI began its comeback. Junior third baseman Robby Nesovic committed a throwing error to first base, allowing the runner on third to advance and tie the game after UCI earned its first run on a RBI groundout.</p>\n<p>The two runs were charged to junior pitcher Austin Pettibone, who exited the game after allowing hits to the first two batters of the inning. Pettibone worked efficiently other than his final inning pitched. The right-hander commanded the strike zone to keep the Anteaters off the board, but ran out of gas towards the end. He finished with 6.1 innings pitched, four strikeouts and two walks allowed.</p>\n<p>Junior second baseman Woody Woodward came to bat in the second inning with a runner in scoring position to earn the game’s first run on a RBI single to center field. Not until the fifth inning did we see any scoring from either side. Senior left fielder Joey Epperson knocked in a run on only his third hit of his last 26 plate appearances against a conference opponent to give the Gauchos a 2-0 lead at the time.</p>\n<p>Irvine jumped out to a two-run lead in the second inning of the series’ first game on three hits off of starting sophomore pitcher Justin Jacome. UCSB, however, was quick to counter with two runs of its own in the following inning to tie the contest at two runs apiece.</p>\n<p>Junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa knocked in both runs with a bases-loaded, two-out single to right center field. In putting up two runs on the scoreboard, Santa Barbara became just the fourth team this season to score multiple runs against UCI’s senior pitcher Andrew Morales.</p>\n<p>Jacome ran into trouble again in the fifth inning, first by allowing a single and a walk, then by giving up a two-run RBI double to junior first baseman Connor Spencer for a 4-2 Anteater lead. Still in the sixth inning, Jacome retired two batters before giving up a triple to score the runner from first base.</p>\n<p>UCI tacked on one more run in the seventh inning as Morales kept UCSB in check throughout the game. Morales improved to 8-0 on the season, pitching 7.2 innings, striking out seven and walking only three.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays tomorrow against Cal State Bakersfield on the road in a one-game solo series. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 4th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55149\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55149\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/","id":4416,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4415,4414,4413],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sweep, Now Tied for First Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB moves into tie for first place after sweeping UC Riverside.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past weekend could not have gone any better for the UCSB softball team.</p>\n<p>Going into the weekend, the Gauchos knew they needed a sweep to stay in contention for a Big West Championship.

So now that we’ve swept Riverside, we’re tied with Long Beach in first, so it’s pretty big.”</p>\n<p>After giving up 19 runs last weekend to Hawaii, Wisdom was back on her game. Wisdom gave up just four runs over the weekend, three earned, improving to 21-13 on the season. The win was the 62nd of her career, which ties Sandy Ortigies’ record set in 1987 for the most wins in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii is a really strong hitting team, so I expected them to score off of me, but this weekend I worked on keeping the ball low,” Wisdom said.</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s 5-3 victory to clinch the series, UCSB jumped out to a 5-1 lead. However, in the closest game of the series, Riverside wasn’t going to allow the Gauchos an easy victory.</p>\n<p>With one out in the seventh inning, junior shortstop Kris DeAnda doubled to score freshman right fielder Sommer Wilson and cut the deficit to two runs. UCR continued to rally, putting two runners in scoring position, but could not come up with the hit to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore catcher MeShalon “Meme” Moore anchored Santa Barbara offensively, hitting 4-4 with two runs and two RBI. Wisdom also scored two runs on 2-3 hitting.</p>\n<p>“We know we can hit the ball and string in hits and have a strong defense,” Wisdom said. “That helped us having a really good defense this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Game two of Saturday’s double header saw a 3-0 victory for UCSB as the entire team got involved offensively. Wisdom went 3-4 at the plate while senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil hit 2-3 with one run and one RBI. Senior first baseman Lauren Boser also went 1-2 with 2 RBI, and freshman left fielder Kristen Clark, who broke the single season hits record last weekend, hit 3-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB first got on the board in the third inning when Pilpil singled to score the eventual game-winning run. In the fifth, the Gauchos were able to get numerous runners on base due to Riverside sophomore pitcher Sophie Slagle walking batters. Three of her five walks came in this inning. With the bases loaded once again, Boser singled to center field, scoring two runners and clinching the game.</p>\n<p>Winning the first game 4-1, seven of 10 players in the Gauchos’ rotation got a hit and five had at least two hits as they outhit UCR 13-5.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that all of us were hitting, moving runners and scoring them,” Wisdom said. “It helps a lot and helps us score more easily.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the final two games, the Highlanders got on the board first. Their best hitter, senior center fielder Dionne Anderson, singled and stole second before junior first baseman Karina Romero singled up the middle to score Anderson. During Saturday’s double header, Anderson was 4-5 with one run while Romero hit 4-6 with one RBI.</p>\n<p>The lead was short-lived, however, as UCSB evened the score in the second inning. Pilpil singled, Boser was hit by a pitch and freshman shortstop Emily Brucelas walked to load the bases. Then, freshman center fielder Stacy Cavazos was also hit by a pitch to score Pilpil.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added two additional runs in the fourth and fifth innings before putting the Highlanders away in the sixth inning with a home run from Wisdom, her sixth of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final series of the season next weekend at home against Long Beach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 4th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/","id":1067,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1066,1065,1064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Playoffs First Round Winners and Losers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nba-logo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nba-logo.jpg?resize=500%2C487&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Michael Jorgenson discusses the biggest successes and failures of the first round of the NBA Playoffs.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>True NBA fans don’t get their yearly fix of basketball heaven during March Madness — they get it in May and June.

But he made it clear from his first moments wearing a Trail Blazers uniform that he was not just another early first-round point guard bust. Lillard took the NBA on in his rookie year <em>à</em><em> </em>la Chris Paul in 2005, taking home Rookie of the Year honors in a landslide. He was fearless, he was very good and just about everyone who saw him knew that he was going to be something special.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to this year, and to say that the Blazers’ future is bright would be a huge understatement. Lillard finished his first ever first-round series with averages of 25-6-6, with all of his main statistical categories making drastic improvements. With LaMarcus Aldridge complementing Lillard’s all-star play, the Blazers were able to take down the fourth-seeded Houston Rockets in six games. The last play we saw from that series will surely be remembered for years to come. With 0.9 seconds left, trailing by two, Lillard caught the ball off a screen, quickly planted his feet and knocked down one of the most cold-blooded threes I have ever seen, sending his team to the next round.</p>\n<p>He’s a guy who plays well beyond his years, and if he keeps progressing at this rate, we’re going to be seeing him hold up an MVP trophy someday, whether it’s in May or June.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Dwight Howard – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Speaking of Lillard’s shot, my favorite moment was actually the one we saw shortly after. The Laker in me will hate the Blazers as a team forever, but it will always love that post-game celebration for one reason: Dwight Howard’s face.</p>\n<p>Dwight was once a top MVP candidate in Orlando and the easy choice for Defensive Player of the Year. He was once considered Superman. But ever since the Dwightmare began, it’s all gone downhill for him. He was out with a back injury for his final days in Orlando, traded to the Lakers, experienced the worst, most embarrassing year in the Kobe Bryant era at the time (and there have been a couple of really bad ones) and ran away from the bright lights to Houston. It didn’t take long for him and the rest of the league to realize that Dwight’s days playing second fiddle to a shooting guard were not over yet.</p>\n<p>This team has been clearly established as James Harden’s team from the second Harden arrived two years ago. Let’s face it though — Dwight’s numbers are still up there. He averaged 26 points and nearly 14 rebounds per game in the first round — it’s just the way he looks on the court. He used to be the closest thing to Shaq we had left. He used to be a dominant force. For the last two years, though, he’s looked like a pushover. His mentality is that of a pushover, and his record of 2-8 in the playoffs since leaving Orlando is something that is surely haunting his already-tarnished reputation right now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Oklahoma City Thunder – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Losing Game Five at home — no matter how close it was to a win — was not something that these hopeful champs should have let happen. They did what they were supposed to do, winning Game Six in Memphis in a convincing fashion and finishing it off at home in Game Seven, but there are some holes in the Thunder’s armor that the rest of the league is surely aware of.</p>\n<p>The last time Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were both healthy in the playoffs, they made it to the Finals. However, San Antonio will have no fear playing the young Thunder superstars with home-court advantage and the powers of the anti-aging serum Gregg Popovich has been feeding his team for the last 10 years. That is, if the Spurs even make it to the conference finals, because Chris Paul is hungry for some championship action. Time to shape up, OKC; this is supposed to be your time to shine, not the Clippers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Brooklyn Nets – Looking Good</b></p>\n<p>This is a team that was built for the playoffs. Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce look fresher than they did all season. Deron Williams and Joe Johnson are perennial All-Stars and have plenty of playoff experience themselves. The Nets swept Miami 4-0 in the regular season. Yes, it’s just the regular season, but when it comes to taking down the champs in the playoffs, you need to take every advantage you can get. The Nets have the advantage of confidence and leaders who have beaten LeBron numerous times in the past. Brooklyn-Miami will be a fun series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Indiana Pacers – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Well, when you talk about OKC going down 3-2 to Memphis, at least you’re talking about a pair of 50-win teams. The Pacers should be embarrassed for going down 3-2 to the Atlanta Hawks, a team that was well below .500 and still managed to make the playoffs in a poorly contested Eastern Conference. They tend to step up their game against Miami, but after barely slipping by Atlanta, this team had better get its act together quickly. Luckily, they have the Wizards in the second round and not the Nets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let’s hope for more amazing games in round two!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/","id":2066,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[2065,2064,2063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Chasing A Ticket to the Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 24 Gauchos Travel to No. 20 UC Irvine in Biggest Series of the Season  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 24 UCSB baseball team will play in its biggest series of the season beginning tomorrow when it travels to face the top team in the Big West, No. 20 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“This is a big one when you look at our RPI numbers,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We’re close to Irvine, so going down there and getting a series win on the road against a good RPI team would be good for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters with a 26-11-1 record overall and 7-8 Big West record after Tuesday’s 5-5 tie against UCLA.

It’s the same mentality going into this weekend as any weekend.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine comes into the weekend’s contest as the hottest team in the conference with an 11-1 league and 29-14 overall record on the year after defeating USC in a one-game series on Tuesday. Prior to that game, UCI swept three of its four conference series with its lone loss coming against UC Riverside. However, the Anteaters’ conference record at this point might not reflect the team’s true identity.</p>\n<p>Irvine has preyed on the lesser teams of the conference and has yet to face a ranked Big West opponent. This series against the Gauchos marks the beginning of a tough stretch of ranked conference opponents for UCI, which has to play Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton to close out the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been hurt by inconsistent starting pitching that has resulted in the team playing from behind on many occasions. UCSB will need its pitchers to go deeper into games and command the strike zone against an Anteater team that features many threats on offense. Among those hitters is junior first baseman Connor Spencer, who leads the team with a .366 batting average and 33 RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send out its same three starting pitchers it did in its previous conference series. Sophomore Justin Jacome will take the mound in game one after displaying a solid outing in his last start. In that performance against UC Riverside, Jacome pitched into the seventh inning and allowed only two runs to pick up his fifth win of the year.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Pettibone will try to bounce back from a subpar start last week. The Gauchos’ ace was not his usual self in his last game as he allowed five runners to reach home plate, which raised his ERA to 4.94. Freshman Shane Bieber will take the mound in the third game of the series.</p>\n<p>Besides pitching playing a key role in gaining the upper hand, the Gauchos will also need to perform better offensively to come out with a series win.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have be better at executing,” Checketts said. “It’s a difficult park to score in and they have good pitching, so we’re going to have to be able to [play] short game and be able to bunt and be able to execute hit-and-runs and do the little things we didn’t do against [UCLA].”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Anteaters enter in first place primarily due to their pitching. Irvine has a combined 2.50 ERA and senior Andrew Morales leads the staff with the nation’s third-best ERA at 0.78.</p>\n<p>If UCSB establishes a lead in the final innings of any of its games, the team has an excellent track record of closing the door on its opponents because of its bullpen. Junior relief pitcher Greg Mahle has excelled in his role as setup man for the Gauchos this year. In 24 appearances, Mahle has a 1.90 ERA to go along with 30 strikeouts. Against the Bruins, Mahle retired the six batters he faced without trouble.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s most consistent pitcher all year long however, has been sophomore closer Dillon Tate. Tate has served as the lights-out stopper coming out of the pen for UCSB this year. To put into perspective how dominant the hurler has been so far, he has struck out 39 batters in only 29.1 innings of work. Tate had his longest outing of the season against UCLA, throwing four innings of shutout ball before the game was called a draw.</p>\n<p>Despite pitching four innings on Tuesday, Tate will be available to pitch as early as the first game of the series if the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<p>“He went through 56 pitches [against UCLA]. He should be able to bounce back and be okay,” Checketts said. “It probably won’t be a long save. We usually don’t use him long on Friday, but if he has a save opportunity I think he’ll be available.”</p>\n<p>First pitch at Irvine is scheduled for tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 1st’s print edition of The Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/","id":4414,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4413,4412,4411],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":125,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
