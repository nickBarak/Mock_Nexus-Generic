The Gauchos will face the Mustangs for the first time since April 10, a game in which UCSB won at home 6-5.</p>\n<p>“It was a close game,” senior outfielder Joey Wallace said. “There’s definitely a rivalry between us so any time we play each other is going to be a close game. I would expect nothing less from this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently ranked No. 6 in conference with a 10-11 league record and a 24-24 mark overall. Cal Poly, which will be hosting UCSB this weekend for the first time all season, currently stands at No. 4 in the Big West with a 10-8 league record and 30-20 mark overall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cal Poly’s home record has been strong this season; the Mustangs are 19-7 when competing at Baggett Stadium. Cal Poly has swept three teams in three-game series this year — first visiting Oklahoma State, then San Diego State, and most recently University of the Pacific. UCSB has leveled off at .500 in road games, and has swept two teams in three-game series, San Jose State and University of the Pacific.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have been fueling their wins from behind the plate all season. Cal Poly currently leads the Big West conference with a .288 batting average, .416 slugging percentage, 285 runs scored, 499 hits and 264 RBI. The Gauchos rank No. 2 in slugging percentage with a .372 mark, and No. 3 in RBIs with 260.</p>\n<p>“We definitely know they’re an offensive threat, so we need to stay focused on defense and our pitchers need to pound the strike zone,” Wallace said. “We can’t give them any extra opportunities since they can take advantage of them … they’re a good hitting team.”</p>\n<p>Pitching for UCSB this weekend will likely be freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez, who has seen a considerable amount of time at the mound this season, and has likewise seen his performance improve over the weeks. Vasquez currently leads the league with a 1.73 ERA and is ranked No. 1 in opponent’s batting average by only allowing other teams a .197 average against him.</p>\n<p>Vasquez and the Gaucho pitching staff will see an unusual competitor from behind the plate this weekend in Cal Poly junior outfielder Mitch Haniger. Haniger leads the Big West offensively with a .616 batting average, and ranks No. 3 overall with 39 runs scored.</p>\n<p>When the two teams met for a nonconference, solo-game series on April 10 in Santa Barbara, Haniger hit 2-for-5 with a team-leading two runs scored, yet the Gauchos were able to pull off a 6-5 victory. The games saw three different pitchers take the mound for UCSB, including senior righthander Matt Vedo, who allowed just two runs and five hits in 6.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a better idea of what they’re going to bring offensive-wise,” Wallace said. “It’d be huge to go up there and win a series. We’ve worked hard all year and that’d be a nice little payoff.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for 6 p.m. tonight at Cal Poly’s Baggett Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47003\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-18/ucsb-faces-cal-poly-final-season-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47003\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-18/ucsb-faces-cal-poly-final-season-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-18/ucsb-faces-cal-poly-final-season-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-18/ucsb-faces-cal-poly-final-season-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-18/ucsb-faces-cal-poly-final-season-series/","id":4519,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4518,4517,4516],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"13 Freshmen To Aid Gauchos Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With 10 seniors set to graduate this spring, the UCSB women’s soccer team is in a state of flux after their 2-6 last place finish in conference this season (7-11-2 overall).

Although extremely raw and immature physically, Beeler has shown great potential and is already a capable defender with great hands. According to ESPN, Beeler is the No. 131-ranked power forward.</p>\n<p>“He can run and shot block at this level now,” Williams said of his tallest recruit. “He has got to get way more physical, but his upside is as good as anybody in this class — that is why we had to beat out Washington State and other bigger conference teams to get him, because it’s so hard to find bigs that can run at this level.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mitch Brewe</strong></p>\n<p>Mitch Brewe, a 6’8” forward out of Seattle Prep in Seattle, WA, may have the best chance out of any Gaucho to make an immediate impact as a freshman. Brewe is the No. 65 power forward in this year’s class. The lack of depth in the UCSB frontcourt may allow this 230-pound power forward to contribute as a defender and high-energy post player off the bench.</p>\n<p>“Brewe is very strong, very physical and ready defensively,” Williams said. “He is fundamentally sound and can make an immediate impact as a great screener, defender and ball movement guy.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Michael Bryson</strong></p>\n<p>A 6’4” guard from Foothill High School in Sacramento, CA, Michael Bryson has the all-around game to make an immediate and lasting impact on the program in the coming years. Bryson, the No. 81-ranked shooting guard in his class according to ESPN, is known as a great shooter with range. Despite averaging just over 14 points per game in high school, Bryson attracted coach Williams with his all-around game.</p>\n<p>“He is a good shooter but a better basketball player,” Williams said. “He has got a really good basketball sense and makes a great commitment to the defensive end of the floor. He is a complete player that will only improve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Dalante Dunklin</strong></p>\n<p>Dalante Dunklin is a 6’0” point guard out of Francis Parker High School in San Diego, CA. The No. 40-ranked point guard according to ESPN, Dunklin is an athletic beast. A strong and active player, Dunklin is a physical presence that can blow by a defender for a dunk or hold his ground defensively. With junior Nate Garth and freshman T.J. Taylor returning as point guards, it is unsure whether Dunklin will redshirt or not, and if he will be able to acquire playing time next season. “[Dalante] is way more of a physical presence than any point guard we have had recently,” Williams said. “I think he is physically ready to come in and play at this level. The adjustments will come within growing up and being a point guard in terms of leadership and all that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Aamahd Walker</strong></p>\n<p>Coach Williams’ latest recruit, Aamahd Walker, committed to attend UCSB after signing a national letter of intent in early April. The 6’2” shooting guard from Culver City High School in Culver City, CA is a natural wing scorer in the mold of recently departed senior shooting guard Orlando Johnson or last year’s recruit, redshirt freshman John Green. According to ESPN, Walker is the No. 69-ranked shooting guard in the nation in his recruiting class.</p>\n<p>Walker averaged 20.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.5 steals, 3.0 assists and 1.1 blocked shots per game during his senior season. He also shot 46 percent from the field, 33 percent from three-point range and 76 percent from the free throw line. Walker’s outstanding performance led to a Second Team All-CIF selection and First Team All-Ocean League.</p>\n<p>“He is really talented offensively — a natural scorer,” Williams said. “If we don’t redshirt him, I would expect him to make an immediate scoring impact. … He made such a commitment of wanting to be here. He really had to work and change certain aspects of his academics and he worked very hard to make it happen.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the freshmen of this year’s class, UCSB will return three redshirt freshmen in 6’5” guard John Green, 6’8” forward Taran Brown and 6’1” walk-on guard Duke DaRe. The rest of the Gaucho roster is expected to be filled out by three sophomores, two juniors and a lone senior.</p>\n<p>“A lot of how we play and determining which of our freshmen will redshirt next season will depend on our bigs,” coach Williams said. “In Big Al [Williams], we have a legitimate center, but with him off the court we have to play a smaller lineup. If Brewe or Beeler can come in and contribute right away, then we won’t have to worry about catering to our big lineup and our small lineup in different situations.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46971\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46971\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/","id":721,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[720,719,718],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Seventh Wonder of the World","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a freshman at UCSB, Barbara Nwaba didn’t know what the heptathlon was.

Yet, former Track and Field coach Josh Priester saw something more and began training Nwaba in her sophomore season for the heptathlon, a race that takes place over two days and involves seven events: the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200-meter run, long jump, javelin throw and 800 meter run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Immediately, Nwaba took to the event. She ran her first heptathlon March 13 and 14, 2009 at the Sam Adams Combined Events and earned a score of 4772, breaking the school record of 4767 set by Erika Bornhorst in 1996.</p>\n<p>“My high school coach mentioned [the heptathlon], but I had no idea what it was,” Nwaba said. “Then, [when I was a sophomore], the coach here thought I’d be really good at it. I was really scared, but my first time out I broke the school record, so I was like, ‘I’ll keep with this.’”</p>\n<p>Since then, Nwaba’s success seems endless. In 2010, Nwaba was named an NCAA All-American and broke her own UCSB record twice in the heptathlon, including at the Big West Championships, where Nwaba scored 5,552 and won the event.</p>\n<p>“She’s done so much for the program and you know when she steps onto the track, she’s going to put 110 percent into it,” senior Ryan Martin said. “Pretty much every time she competes, she’s PR’ing. I know she wants to do great things and I think she’s going to.”</p>\n<p>This April at the Sam Adams Multi-Events, Nwaba finished the heptathlon with a phenomenal score of 5,986. The score was not only a personal best for Nwaba, but was good enough to break the overall Big West Conference record. As a result, Nwaba also earned the No. 1 ranking in the nation in the heptathlon.</p>\n<p>“That day was so perfect,” Nwaba said. “Day one went really well — way better than I was expecting. I wasn’t worrying, I was just competing. To see how close I was to 6000, it was a great day.”</p>\n<p>Two weekends ago in the Big West Multi-Event Championships, Nwaba won again with a score of 5,709 and surpassed the conference record set by Sharon Day four years ago in 2008. “I was a little disappointed by the score, but I still broke the record, so I felt I accomplished something,” Nwaba said. “I’ve come a long way. It was good to get a win there because the first time [I competed there,] I came in third.”</p>\n<p>After the victory, Nwaba earned her fourth consecutive Big West Athlete of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>“I remember at the beginning of the year I thought it would be cool to get one [Big West Athlete of the Week award], and now to have four is amazing,” Nwaba said. “I’m happy I’m doing so well this year.”</p>\n<p>While Nwaba has proven to be the best heptathlete to compete at UCSB, she strives for perfection and is never happy with just a win.</p>\n<p>“To get a PR is a good feeling so that reinforces you to keep [training],” Nwaba said. “And I’m competitive with myself.”</p>\n<p>The training is strenuous, but for Nwaba, has always kept practice interesting.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot more hours [of practice] because there are so many events, so it’s so hard to get them all in during the week,” Nwaba said. “It takes a lot of dedication when you have to master seven events, but it’s definitely fun.”</p>\n<p>The determination may pay off, as this summer, Nwaba will have a shot at earning one of three heptathlon spots at the Olympic Games in London. Like most athletes, the Olympics have been the ultimate dream for Nwaba as long as she can remember.</p>\n<p>“In the last Olympics, it [gave] me chills to see [the track athletes] cross the line and win,” Nwaba said. “I want to excel and I know that’s the biggest accomplishment ever, so that pushes me.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba’s dream could very well become a reality. She is currently No. 2 in the nation in the heptathlon behind senior Brianne Theisen. The last two years, Nwaba has also taken a step toward her dream by competing at the USA Nationals. Nwaba placed eighth this year, but knows she can do better.</p>\n<p>“It was defining to be with girls whose scores were so big, but I knew I could do just as well,” Nwaba said. “I started to feel like, ‘I could beat this girl. I can compete with them.’ I didn’t really believe [my dream was possible] until I was competing [there] with the U.S. National Team.”</p>\n<p>Olympic trials will be held in Eugene, Oregon, beginning June 21.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be hard because there are three great heptathletes in the U.S., but she has a chance,” Martin said. “If she competes well in the trials she could do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/","id":3174,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3173,3172,3171],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tennis Reloads with Talented Recruits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For the second straight year, the UCSB men’s tennis team will bring in a highly touted “blue chip” recruit from California: Matthew Alves from Gold River, who has been ranked as high as No. 19 i...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the second straight year, the UCSB men’s tennis team will bring in a highly touted “blue chip” recruit from California: Matthew Alves from Gold River, who has been ranked as high as No. 19 in the country among high school seniors by tennisrecuiting.net.

With the game 2-1 in the sixth inning, senior outfielder Brooke Putich singled with the bases loaded to add to the lead.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom, who went on to pitch all 21 innings of the series, struck out six batters and limited the Matadors to one run on three hits for a 4-1 win.</p>\n<p>“We were engaged in the win; our defense made the plays and our offense adjusted,” senior catcher Lainey DePompa said. “We enjoyed each other and really playing together. Being present in the moment is what we did.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had no trouble scoring runs in the second game of Friday’s doubleheader. With the game scoreless, UCSB exploded in the fourth inning for a five-run inning. The Gauchos added on two extra runs in the seventh inning as Wisdom delivered her fifth home run of the season, a two-run blast over the left center field fence for a 7-0 win.</p>\n<p>Friday’s first match saw Wisdom’s first collegiate no-hitter. Wisdom retired the first nine batters she faced in order as the Gaucho offense also struggled manufacturing a run. Not until the seventh were the Gauchos able to break through with RBI hits by junior outfielder Jessica Soria and sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil to win 2-0.</p>\n<p>Only two Matador runners were able to reach base, both on fielding errors as Wisdom broke the school record for most strikeouts in a season in the process; she finished with 247 strikeouts on the season and 24 wins.</p>\n<p>“We expected [Wisdom] to do great things before she got here and she lived up to those expectations,” Galicinao said. “She’s really matured over the course of the year. It’s exciting we still have another three years with her.”</p>\n<p>With the season now over, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to next year where they will be lead by their two seniors, Jennings and Soria, and a talented supporting cast.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/","id":966,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[965,964,963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Series to No. 8 Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hosting No. 8 Fullerton in its last home series of the season, the UCSB baseball team lost two of three games to one of the best teams in the nation in a wild weekend affair.

We’re all clicking and as long as we stay within ourselves and play relaxed, I think we have a chance.”</p>\n<p>At 27-28 overall and 12-6 in confer- ence, the Gauchos have the opportunity to go over .500 for the first time this season with a sweep of the Matadors. If they sweep, it will mark the first time since 2008 that the Gauchos win 30 games in a season. Northridge, losers of five straight, come in 10-39 overall and 5-13 in league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB is currently in a three-way tie for second place along with Pacific and UC Davis. The Gauchos need Pacific to beat first place Long Beach State twice this weekend and have UC Davis lose at least one game to secure the conference’s at-large bid to qualify for the postseason. If Long Beach only wins one game, the possibility of a three-way tie for first place exists, with UC Davis winning due to head-to-head competition against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy that everything is coming down to this one weekend,” sophomore infielder Kathryn Pilpil said. “We have to do our job and hopefully the other teams can beat each other out so we can come in first in Big West.”</p>\n<p>Hoping to pitch the Gauchos into the postseason for the first time since 2007, freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom looks to put the finishing touches on her spectacu- lar freshman campaign. Already setting the school record for most wins in a season (21), Wisdom ranks No. 27 in the nation in strikeouts (227) and is seven strikeouts shy of breaking the school record for most in a season.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos to come out on top this weekend, they must carry over the offense they displayed last weekend when they scored 17 runs in a sweep of Cal Poly.

Irvine contained the UCSB offense to just four runs in the series, including two shutout losses. UCSB’s Vertigan led the team with three hits on the weekend, while freshman left-handed pitcher Andrew Vasquez only allowed one run in 6.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The Titans are coming off a three-game series sweep against Pacific on the road last weekend, and a solo- game series win against USC just days before. In its last 11 games, Fullerton is 9-2 overall, with five wins coming on the road.</p>\n<p>A dynamic to watch for throughout the weekend will be the play that originates behind the plate for each team. While Fullerton is tied for No. 1 in the league with a .285 batting average, and leads the league with a .366 on-base percentage, UCSB is No. 4 in both categories. Vertigan currently leads the league in batting average with a .371 mark and is No. 2 in on-base percentage behind teammate sophomore infielder Brandon Trinkwon.</p>\n<p>However, the defensive play of both teams will likely determine who takes the wins this weekend. Both squads boast impressive statistics in regards to allowing runs for opponents; Fullerton gives up just 3.59 runs per game while UCSB allows only 4.62.</p>\n<p>“I feel like pitching is going to be strong in this series too,” Vertigan said. “I think it’s going to be similar to the Irvine series. Not a bunch of runs scored … we have three solid pitchers going out there and I know they have some good guys too.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could potentially break into the top three teams in league with a strong showing against Fullerton this weekend, which would further their chances of post- season success.</p>\n<p>“If we win these three against Fullerton, and then the next three against Cal Poly, we still have a chance to take first in league,” Vertigan said. “But a lot of things have to go into that happening.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for today at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46872\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46872\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/","id":4375,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4374,4373,4372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From Abroad to All-Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Seniors Mathieu Forget from Geneva, Switzerland and Natalia Lozano from Valladolid, Spain helped lead the way for the UCSB men’s and women’s tennis teams this season.

We got Second Team before and this year we beat a couple ranked teams, so we did really well.</p>\n<p>Mathieu: I’m really, really happy … to prove myself and prove my coaches they made good decisions getting me here. Anybody can do it if you put the work in.</p>\n<p>David: Head coach Marty Davis [of the men’s team] was named Big West Coach of the Year—</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>M:Oh, he was?</p>\n<p>N: Yeah!</p>\n<p>M: Well I’m really happy for him … we had really good chemistry on our team and Marty was able to keep it together. He deserves it; I owe him a lot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Junior Benjamin Recknagel was also named First Team and Ndimande was named Second Team in singles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is your biggest individual accomplishment?</p>\n<p>M: Playing No. 1 my senior year. Freshman year I was maybe last on the team. Also, beating Fabian Matthews [of UC Irvine] twice who kicked my [butt] last year.</p>\n<p>N: Improving during four years. Doubles was also really important, because I didn’t play doubles before and it became the most fun. I will always remember the win against the Ellison sisters [of San Diego State].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is your biggest team accomplishment?</p>\n<p>M: Winning Big West my freshman year; we were the underdogs for sure. But I think best of all is beating [No. 22] Texas Tech this year. I wasn’t able to win at No. 1 but I was so happy I didn’t even care; it was such a good team win.</p>\n<p>N: When we beat Long Beach last year. Also Cal Poly’s match [in this year’s Big West Tournament] — that was amazing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At what point did you know you would go to college in the United States?</p>\n<p>N: I didn’t know [until] I met people from here who were studying in Spain, so I started looking at colleges. I was gonna give it a try but I didn’t even know I was gonna stay four years.</p>\n<p>M: Two years before I graduated high school. I knew you could play sports. I didn’t get recruited but I wanted to go abroad, so I decided to take a year off and practice everyday and get a scholarship.</p>\n<p>N: In Europe either you go pro or study, so this is the best opportunity someone ever gave me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During your freshman year, how did you see yourself as a senior?</p>\n<p>N: It was rough; it was a different way of life—</p>\n<p>M: Different way of playing tennis, too. It’s so individual in Europe, so playing tennis on a team was kinda weird. But I told myself freshman year, “I’m gonna play No. 1 one day here.”</p>\n<p>N: It’s been an unbelievable experience for four years; we’ve grown a lot and are completely different people now.</p>\n<p>M: It’s funny ‘cause we were neighbors freshman year, and now realizing we’re both seniors is just crazy. It’s crazy it went that fast.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Plans for next year?</p>\n<p>N: I’m definitely hoping I can stay around SB and find a job. I’m always gonna be linked to tennis and maybe play in tournaments for fun.</p>\n<p>M: I’m still debating if I want to play on the tour for a little bit or follow my passion about performing … I love performing so much and definitely think I’m gonna get a job in Los Angeles. From then on, just audition for any music videos, movies — anything.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One word or phrase your teammates use most often to describe you?</p>\n<p>M: Baby Beast. I used to be the baby on the team, but then when I started winning a lot they said I was going beast mode.</p>\n<p>N: Funny. But I don’t know if I would say that.</p>\n<p>M: No, you’re funny.</p>\n<p>N: They always give me [crap] about my accent. You can put that. Sometimes I’m not trying to be funny and they think I’m hilarious because of my accent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is the hardest part about playing tennis?</p>\n<p>N: You are by yourself. If you’re having a bad day, you have to stay out there as long as you can for your team.</p>\n<p>M: It’s such a nerve-wracking sport and it’s demanding physically … and mentally, you have to stay focused. Losing a couple points might mean lose you the match. It’s stamina.</p>\n<p>N: [The best part is] it helps you grow. It makes you more responsible, and I think that’s why both teams have the highest GPA.</p>\n<p>M: It teaches you how to stay focused for a long time and manage your time. You have to find a solution by yourself, which is where the nerve-wracking part comes in … you have to use your entire body.</p>\n<p>N: You talk too much.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One person who you enjoy competing against the most?</p>\n<p>M: Fabian Matthews. [This year it was] one of my best wins. He used to beat me really bad.

It was just a feeling I guess.”</p>\n<p>Jennings came into the program as a freshman ready to make an immediate impact, starting the first nine games of her career. However, Jennings suffered a devastating setback when she broke her leg, sidelining her for the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>“That was literally the first time I’ve ever been injured; I knew I wasn’t going to be able to play for the rest of the year,” Jennings said. “The second it happened I knew I broke my leg. It was definitely scary because I heard it crack and I was kind of in shock.”</p>\n<p>Despite suffering the season-ending injury, Jennings redshirted and returned the next year to lead the team in home runs and was one of three Gauchos to play in every single game, fulfilling the potential that was realized from her the year before.</p>\n<p>Building on her strong sophomore campaign, Jennings began the 2011 season by playing in 41 games and leading the team in batting average, slugging percentage and home runs. All was going according to schedule until injury struck Jennings once again. This time, a torn ACL sidelined her with another season-ending injury.</p>\n<p>“My second injury last year was harder; it was a different kind of feeling when you tear your ACL but I knew something was wrong because I wasn’t able to get up,” Jennings said. “It was really hard because your role as a teammate changes more as a supporter rather than actually being able to affect what’s going on on the field.”</p>\n<p>Yet, despite suffering another devastating injury, Jennings was determined to come back and play for the Gauchos in her final two seasons of eligibility.</p>\n<p>“I knew I would be able to come back,” Jennings said. “I wanted it bad enough to be able to come back and play. It’s the sport I love to play.”</p>\n<p>Now in her fourth year as a Gaucho, Jennings has not showed any signs of slowing down, playing a huge part in the run the team has made this season — a run that has UCSB within reach of a Big West title.</p>\n<p>“She’s come back from a lot; she’s been working hard and putting in the work necessary to come back,” Galicinao said. “Hitting in the fourth spot is challenging and she still has success hitting from that spot.”</p>\n<p>Because of her redshirt status, Jennings has the opportunity of becoming one of the greatest hitters in UCSB history before she leaves. Quickly climbing the record books, she currently ranks fourth overall for most home runs with 21, and has cracked the top 10 in doubles and runs batted in. However, even with a long list of statistical accolades to her name, Jennings still remains focused on the team goal of winning the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m not one to focus on stats,” Jennings said. “Coming into the season, obviously the big team goal is to be Big West champs. Individually, I just came in basically just wanting to play softball. I was mainly there for the team goal and coming in and focusing on everything little by little.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Championship to be determined in the final weekend of the season, the Gauchos hope to make program history. But, looking ahead to next season, there is also reason for optimism — as long as Jennings is penciled into the lineup.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/","id":964,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[963,962,961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fantasy League Gone Wrong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What do you do when everything goes wrong?

Where do you turn when the players you drafted for their production are not producing and that one random player who you didn’t expect to produce much at all stops being so surprisingly useful? That’s my situation at the moment, folks. On paper, my roster is fantastic. My hitters are led by players like David Ortiz and Matt Wieters, and my pitching staff should be unbeatable. And yet here we sit in week five of the 2012 season, and I find myself in last place in my league.</p>\n<p>To be fair to myself, injuries have decimated my roster. Andrew Bailey, Jacoby Ellsbury, Chase Utley and Doug Fister currently reside in that black hole we refer to as the disabled list, yet the players I have left should have been more than capable of holding the fort until their compatriots returned. Clearly, that has not been the case.</p>\n<p>The problem is threefold. First, many of my supposed stars, especially on my pitching staff, are not burning quite as brightly as they usually do. Jon Lester has had a rough start to the season, though it seems he might be turning it around, and Josh Johnson, who I have defended and believed in through out all his injury struggles, has been downright awful, leading many to speculate that he is, once again, injured. Even Roy “Doc” Halladay, who may be the best pitcher in baseball, has proven more vulnerable than usual as of late.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Secondly, my hitters have done little offensively despite generally hitting for high average. Six of my nine starters are hitting over .290 and five of those six are hitting over .300. Despite that, my team ranks in the lower half of my league in every other offensive category. My sluggers are not slugging, my base stealers are not stealing and the fucking snozzberries most certainly do not taste like snozzberries.</p>\n<p>Finally, even when my hitters do have good days, they seem to never have them on the same day. If David Ortiz goes 4-4 with two home runs, the rest of my team will lay a fat goose egg and fry up a delicious omelette that I can’t have any of. And it wouldn’t even be a golden goose egg. Yes, this is the Willy Wonka column. Get me some damn chocolate.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to my problem. You can’t trade away an entire team, and you can’t replace your entire team with free agents. Well, you could, but it would be difficult and far too risky. The only thing I can really do is wait and hope that my team picks itself up out of the gutter.</p>\n<p>Patience is a key to success, both in real baseball and fantasy baseball. In real baseball, hitters need to wait for their pitch, for the right moment to strike. At the moment, I am essentially waiting for my entire team to get their collective pitch. I know I drafted a talented team. I know what they are capable of, and because of that, I am willing to wait out this bad stretch. I’m not after the everlasting gobstopper or the golden egg or even that weird soda that makes you float, although that would be awesome. No, I want it all. I want the whole factory, which is, for those of you who aren’t following because you haven’t seen “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,”</p>\n<p>a metaphor for first place in this case.</p>\n<p>They say that good things come to those who wait. Lucky for me, I’m a champion at waiting. I’m the best at it. I’ll go into hibernation if I have to. I might do that even if I don’t have to. Now that I think about it, hibernating sounds like a great idea. Wake me when the Red Sox win the World Series.

With runners on the corners in the fourth, freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom singled the runner home, and one out later, sophomore outfielder McKenzie Kane gave UCSB a 3-1 lead on an RBI single.</p>\n<p>Wisdom was able to take over the game, allowing only one other batter to reach base and striking out seven hitters total, pitching a complete game to get the win, 4-1.</p>\n<p>“We were so loose, even though the game was only a three-run win,” Pilpil said. “On the field, it didn’t seem like that even though it was only a 4-1 win, it felt much better than that.”</p>\n<p>More offense was on display for game two of the doubleheader as both teams combined for 24 hits in the matchup. Jeppesen gave the Gauchos a 1-0 lead in the second with a single, scoring the runner on third. Wisdom was victim to the long ball, giving up solo homeruns in the third and fourth innings to give the Mustangs a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Down to their last out and trailing 4-3, junior shortstop Keilani Jennings belted her team-leading sixth home run of the season to send the game into extra innings. Cal Poly failed to advance two runners on base in the eighth, setting the stage for Jeppesen to drive home the game-winning run in the bottom of the inning on her fifth hit of the day.</p>\n<p>“Our plans in the bottom of the seventh were to just push one run across and push the game into extra innings, and with one swing we were able to do that,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They really believed they were going to win that game.”</p>\n<p>Five seniors were honored in their final home game before the start of the third game. In the series finale, UCSB again came out swinging early in the game by way of the long ball; with runners on second and third, Jeppesen hit a three-run homerun for a 3-0 lead. UCSB added two more runs — one in the fourth inning and one in the fifth — as Wisdom dominated from the mound.</p>\n<p>Wisdom threw a complete game shutout, allowing only three hits and striking out at least one batter in every inning. The game was called after the sixth inning as the Gauchos put up three more runs and won 8-0 on the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>“They did a good job of focusing, and all the seniors played a role in the win,” Galicinao said. “It was really good for the seniors to cap off their final home game like that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB now goes on the road this Friday to Cal State Northridge with the potential of winning the Big West if Long Beach State stumbles in the final weekend of play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46697\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46697\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/","id":963,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[962,961,960],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Swept by Irvine, Drops to Fifth Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A three-day trip to face lower-ranked UC Irvine turned into a three-game series sweep for the Anteaters and two shutout losses for the UCSB baseball team.

Thurman, who holds a 2.61 ERA on the season thus far, threw six strikeouts in Friday’s series opener to add to his 6-2 record on the year.</p>\n<p>“Their pitchers did a really good job of minimizing innings,” Vertigan said. “All of our hits were spread out. We just didn’t get hits at the right times of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to put runners in scoring position four different times throughout the game, yet could not get a foot past third base. Senior Kevin Gelinas saw action in his first weekend start since February, and though the lefty gave up just two runs in the fifth inning, it was enough to hand him his first loss of the year.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game provided similar results to the first, highlighted by another 2-0 loss for UCSB. Gaucho freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez’s phenomenal performance over 6.1 innings may have been overshadowed by the loss, yet Vasquez was still able to lower his ERA to 1.69 by allowing just one run during his time on the mound.</p>\n<p>UCSB was again able to manage just four hits in the game, two of which came from the bat of Vertigan. Vertigan, who has twice been named Big West Player of the Week so far this season, currently leads the team offensively with a .370 batting average and a .519 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>In the closing game of the series on Sunday, UCSB was able to put players past home plate four times, yet it wasn’t enough to match the five runs scored by UCI. Gaucho sophomore inf ielder Brandon Trinkwon led all hitters in the game with four hits in five at-bats, forcing the UCI pitching staff to switch up its gameplan.</p>\n<p>“We actually got to their bullpen and were able to put some pressure on that first [pitcher],” Vertigan said. “Once we got him out of the game, it was kind of a big deal because once you get to their pen, it gets easier to get after teams.”</p>\n<p>Digging in to the Anteater bullpen for 12 hits on 38 at-bats wasn’t enough for the Gauchos to overcome Irvine’s four-run inning in the fourth, as they fell 5-4 in the top of the ninth.</p>\n<p>“We definitely pitched good enough and played good enough defense to win those games,” Vertigan said. “If we had played our game, we could’ve beaten them in all three games.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return to practice this week to prepare for a three-game home series against Cal State Fullerton this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/","id":716,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[715,714,713],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Play in Final Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a disappointing series loss to UC Davis last weekend, the UCSB softball team returns home for a three game series against rival Cal Poly this weekend.

The loss against Davis cost the Gauchos control of the No. 1 spot in the Big West, a ranking they will continue to compete for in the final homestand of the regular season.</p>\n<p>“[Cal Poly] plays pretty straight up softball,” senior catcher Lainey DePompa said. “They’re always good competition considering it’s Blue-Green rivalry. I think we’re really prepared, especially after facing Davis last weekend.”</p>\n<p>With two conference series remaining, UCSB sits in fourth place with a 24-28 overall record and a 9-6 conference record, two games behind Long Beach State and Pacific. Cal Poly enters Campus Diamond in seventh place at 12-31 overall and 4-11 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos honor five seniors in their final home games: DePompa, outfielder Allison Taylor, outfielder Brooke Putich, utility Jenny Liepman, and pitcher Krista Cobb. DePompa leads the team in home runs (5) and is second on the team in slugging percentage (.401). Taylor leads the Gauchos in RBI (22) and is right behind DePompa in slugging percentage</p>\n<p>(.366). “I couldn’t ask for a better</p>\n<p>group of seniors to play with,” sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil said. “This program means so much to them. They really showed us what Gaucho softball is all about.”</p>\n<p>In last weekend’s series, the Gauchos dropped two out of three games by a combined total of three runs. The top performer for Santa Barbara was freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom, who set the school record for wins in a season (19) with her complete game in the series finale against Davis. Wisdom has been the best pitcher for the Gauchos all year long, leading the staff in ERA (2.52), complete games (23), innings pitched (227.2) and strikeouts (206).</p>\n<p>Wisdom will have to find a way to subdue Cal Poly’s main offensive threat, sophomore shortstop Kim Westlund. As the leadoff hitter, Westlund is tops on the team in batting average (.326), slugging percentage (.450), hits (42) and RBIs (23). A consistent threat in the batter’s box, Westlund has hit safely in 31 games this season, including reaching base in 12 of the last 13 games. She also leads the team with 10 multi-hit games. “We need to come out, play our game</p>\n<p>and not worry about what they’re doing,” Pilpil said. “If we just worry about Cal Poly, that’s just going to hold us back from beating them. If we play how we normally do and play relaxed and loose, we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have found success at Campus Diamond recently, winning three out of the last four series. However, the Gauchos are 13-6 at home this year and Cal Poly has yet to win a conference series on the road this season.</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for Saturday at noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46656\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/gauchos-play-final-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46656\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/gauchos-play-final-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/gauchos-play-final-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/gauchos-play-final-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/gauchos-play-final-homestand/","id":955,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[954,953,952],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":169,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
