\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB accounted for the first of those three back on Nov. 5 in Irvine when the Gauchos were in the midst of their first substantial winning streak during the conference schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis has been the most potent offensive force for the Anteaters, averaging 3.50 kills per set in Big West play, seventh in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She sports a solid .241 kill percentage and is one of 11 players to cross the 200-point threshold throughout the conference schedule, joined by her teammate, sophomore outside hitter Harlee Kekauoha. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another senior, setter Shelley Anderson, is responsible for creating opportunities for Dennis and her fellow outside and opposite hitters, averaging just under 10 assists per set during the Big West season, right behind Gaucho redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley’s 10.22 which rank fifth in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Anteaters, Kekauoha, who ranks second on her team in kills per set, also gives them an edge in the service game as she’s led All-Big West competition with .58 services aces per set. Junior libero Luna Tsujimoto is one of seven Big West players to average at least four digs per set in conference play; her mark of 4.28 per set is about a half dig shy of Gaucho sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi’s 4.71 league-leading number. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this will surely be UCSB’s final match of the year, there are still many bright spots in what was a vastly improved season for the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lindsey Ruddins will wrap up a tremendously successful conference schedule in which she averaged 3.83 kills per set (fifth in the Big West), .56 service aces per set (second), 2.06 digs per set (28th) and 4.5 points per set (third). If she can top 20 kills in the contest, it would be her third time in four matches and fifth this season. After missing out on the 2015 season, Ruddins has proved to be every bit as good as billed in 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After transferring from Wisconsin, Hannah Juley, too, was an absolute standout for the Gauchos in 2016. Finishing with the fifth-most assists per set amongst her Big West competition, Juley hit her stride when the conference schedule started. Since then she’s accumulated five double-doubles, eight matches with at least 40 assists and two with at least 50. A key concern this season for the Gauchos was locking down the setter position, and Juley has left no question about the direction for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB can also rest easy knowing it has possibly the Big West’s best libero in Petrachi. The sophomore from Modena, Italy leads the conference in digs per set and comes into the match with four straight 20-dig efforts after only five up to that point in the year. On the verge of completing her second season, Petrachi’s experience will be vital for the Gauchos going forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior middle blockers Elizabeth Sheffield and Phoebe Grunt will compete in their final match for UCSB Wednesday night, hoping to cap their careers with a victory. Grunt averaged career bests in kills per set with 1.95, and in hitting percentage with .355 in 2016, capping a stellar season despite playing in the fewest matches in her tenure with the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her second year with the team, Sheffield improved her hitting percentage from .244 to .312, and her kills per set from 1.73 to 1.75. She’s gotten to at least 10 points in nine of her last 12 matches and will look to continue that trend in the last match of her collegiate career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With one match left in what has been a rollercoaster year, the Gauchos still have much to glean from the 2016 season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and UC Irvine face off in the final match of the season for both teams at 5 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 23,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the Thunderdome. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/","id":5001,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5000,4999,4998],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Men’s Swimming Finish 1st at A3 Invite, Women’s Clinch 3rd","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For another consecutive year, UC Santa Barbara impressed in the overall rankings at the A3 invite.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Competition was fierce these past few days at East Los Angeles College’s swim facility where, for the fourth year straight, the A3 Performance Invitational was held.

Another top three finish for the women’s, this time in an 11-team meet, has them in good form for the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>Following this outcome, Santa Barbara’s formerly undefeated women settle at 3-1 on the season, whereas the Men’s side even out at 2-2.</p>\n<p>The invitational began on Thursday and lasted until Saturday. Races commenced with 9 a.m. preliminaries and ended with daily 5 p.m. finals.</p>\n<p>UCSB tournament highlights included a win for the men in the 200 yard free relay in which junior Billy Mullis, sophomore Mason Tittle, freshman Riley Ferguson and senior Yoessef Tibazi put up a 1:19.71 finals time. This team would also go on to repeat a win of 3:12.99 in the 400 yard medley relay, in which Ferguson was replaced by senior Andy Castilleja.</p>\n<p>This was followed by sophomore Logan Hotchkiss’s first-place time of 4:19.84 in the men’s 500 yard free finals.</p>\n<p>The men’s side would continue their domination of freestyle competitions by also placing first, second, third and seventh in the 50 yard free.</p>\n<p>The men’s A relay team posted yet another victory with a finals time of 1:28.35 in the 200 yard medley relay with Castilleja being substituted for junior Jonathan Panchak.</p>\n<p>The women’s squad would receive their first win in a nail biter, with freshman Heaven Quintana’s 53.70 finals time in the women’s 100 Yard Fly. Second, third, fourth and fifth came up just short, within fractions of a second of each other.</p>\n<p>Billy Mullis provided another win with a finals time of 47.25 in the men’s 100-yard fly.</p>\n<p>Quintana Heaven once again beat the competition by a time of 1:01.11 in the women’s 100-yard breast. She bested second, third and fourth for yet another close call.</p>\n<p>Castilleja ensured a win in the men’s 100-yard breast with a finals time of 54.38, barely beating his teammate Panchak, who secured second place with a time of 54.95. The duo would then swap positioning in the 200-yard breast in which Panchak’s time of 1:59.43 just held off Castilleja’s 1:59.45</p>\n<p>Mullis, Hotchkiss, freshman Joe Lastelic and senior Dylan Kubick would go on to claim another relay win. Their performance of 6:32.56, in the men’s 800 yard free, finalized their authority in the relay section.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Michael Wang joined the A relay team of Mullis, Tibazi, and Tittle, for the men’s 400 yard free, which wrapped up Santa Barbara’s remarkable tournament with a first place time of 2:57.65.</p>\n<p>Altogether, Gauchos men’s swim put up a whopping 2028 points, in the scoring for overall Team Rankings through event 304, ensuring them a first-place tournament win and their second A3 Performance Invitational victory.</p>\n<p>The women’s came up short of UCLA’s first-place finish by 451.5 points in overall scoring. Third place may have been less than what they had hoped for, but a top three finish out of an 11-team pool is a positive regardless.</p>\n<p>Both the men’s and women’s teams will look to keep up their current forms as the season progresses into its midway stages.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will resume their swim season on Dec. 1 in Austin, Texas for the Texas Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

SMU’s win was the most recent as it beat UCSB 80-73 in an overtime match on Dec. 8, 2014. With only 10 seconds left in that game, guard Gabe Vincent nailed a game-tying three to send the game into an extra period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent has played a big role in the Gauchos offense since his arrival in 2014. The former Big West Freshman of the Year has averaged a team-high of 16 points per game to start the season including a 23-point effort in a loss to USF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the junior guard has hit his fair share of struggles this year only shooting 30 percent from the field and 24 percent from three-point range. Last year, Vincent had the same woes through his first three starts, shooting only 24 percent from the field before ultimately getting on track and shooting 40 percent by the end of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior point guard Eric Childress will also need to be a key factor if the Gauchos hope to notch the first win of the season against a very tough opponent. Childress is coming off a career-high 14-point outing against CSU Bakersfield and leads the team in assists with four per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the biggest key for Santa Barbara will be taking care of the ball. Against the Roadrunners, the Gauchos turned the ball over a season-high 21 times, negating the fact that they outshot their opponents and outrebounded them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key will be to keep the energy high through both halves of the match. This year, Santa Barbara has been outscored 102-100 in the first half but 124-93 in the final half of games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing this, SMU will surely try to take advantage with their high-octane offense. In the second half of games this season, Southern Methodist has outscored its opponents 164-114, meaning the Gauchos will definitely need to be on high alert or the game could turn into a blowout.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Mustangs average 73.2 points per game and are shooting an impressive 45 percent from the field and 36 percent from beyond the arc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Guard Shake Milton has played a big role in the SMU offense averaging 12 points per game and shooting a solid 43 percent from the field. The Oklahoma native was one of 20 candidates named to the 2017 Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award watch list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior forward Semi Ojeleye will also be another player the Gauchos must be weary of. The forward was named American Athletic Conference Player of the Week for Nov. 14 after averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds in both games that week. Ojeleye leads the team in points per game with 20.3 and shoots a team-high 48 percent from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defeating SMU will not be an easy task but a necessary one if Santa Barbara wants to get its season on track. A big road victory would be something that could definitely boost the confidence of all the Gauchos, especially the young ones who are dealing with this type of adversity for the first times in their careers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on SMU at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 22 at the Moody Coliseum.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

NAU, currently on a two-game losing streak, is now 2-2 as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB made a season-high 12-of-14 free-throw attempts in the game. Its 85.7 free-throw percentage was more efficient than any of its free-throw performances from last season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most notably, the Gauchos held the Lumberjacks to their lowest point total through four games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hard fought battle between the two programs ensued as both shot 35 percent from the field in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to get Edelman the ball was evident from the game’s first quarter as she established her dominance in the paint, scoring six points on 3-5 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After taking an 11-7 lead at the 6:15 mark of the game, UCSB was held scoreless until a made layup by junior forward Taylor Farris with 18 seconds remaining in the period. Farris gave the Gauchos stability during their lethargic start, concluding Sunday with eight points on a 4-6 shooting night and six rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just feel like I’m doing whatever the coach asks. If you want to play, you have to come out hard,” Farris said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the score, NAU managed to overcome its four-point deficit with an 11-0 scoring run in the closing minutes of the first quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving life to NAU’s offense was senior guard Brittani Lusain. The senior guard led Northern Arizona in scoring, rebounds and assists with 17 points, nine rebounds and three dimes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NAU earned its largest lead of five points, up 16-11 as a result of a three-point make by redshirt junior forward Kenna McDavis. The Boise State transfer was responsible for two of the Lumberjacks’ total of four three-point makes, sinking 2-3 from deep to end the first half with 10 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to UCSB, Northern Arizona experienced stagnancy on offense as McDavis’ basket would be NAU’s last field goal of the first quarter and the drought continued into the second. NAU went scoreless from the 2:04 mark in the first until McDavis scored its first points at the free-throw line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams continued to trade baskets, leading to a 25-25 tie at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NAU’s last lead of the game, 33-31, was formed by senior guard Rene Coggins taking a wide open right lane to score the go-ahead layup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite going 1-11 from behind the three-point line, coming out of an NAU timeout, the Gauchos gained a spark in the closing minutes of the third quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s penetration of the paint helped provide spacing on the perimeter as an assist from inside by Edelman to Porter for the three-pointer was made. NAU would go on to knot the score at 36-36 in responding with a long distance make by senior guard Taylor Leyva, who has six points and three rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing UCSB with a comfortable lead was a quick 7-1 run to close out the third. The Gauchos gained a 43-37 lead after sophomore guard Coco Miller’s only three-point make of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the fourth quarter, NAU pulled within a one-point deficit a total of four times, but was unable to regain the lead over UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping fend off the Lumberjacks, who trailed 47-46, was senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe in recording her first field goal of the game with 4:42 remaining in the game. She achieved a career-high in free-throw makes and attempts, missing just one as she went 9-10 at the line to register 11 points. Jemerigbe and Miller tied for the game-high in assists with five. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite five fouls limiting her to just 25 minutes, the redshirt sophomore made her first start of the season.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoring each of her field goals from beyond the arc, going 3-5, Porter knocked down a clutch three-pointer to push the Gauchos’ lead to 56-50.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter’s three-pointer was UCSB’s last field goal of the game as the Gauchos secured their victory at the free-throw line. Adding further security to the win was a steal by Miller on an inbound attempt by NAU, leading to Jemerigbe being fouled and ending the game with free-throws. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be back on the road on Friday, Nov. 25 at the University of San Diego.

An eight-point Hawaii run would follow, and UCSB never posed much of a threat for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The third frame saw a similar effort from the Gauchos to begin the set, but another devastating 10-2 Hawaii run midway through, pushing the lead to 20-13, was again UCSB’s downfall.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The Gauchos weren’t able to put up much of a fight in the fourth game, never holding a lead on the way to finishing with only 10 points</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB was held to hitting percentages of -.031, .159 and .000 in the final three sets, starkly contrasting with the .323, .304, and .400 marks achieved by the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Lindsey Ruddins was still very productive for the Gauchos, accumulating 21 kills, albeit on a whopping 68 attempts (.235 kill percentage), along with three service aces and six digs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">She fell just short of Hawaii’s Nikki Taylor, who concluded Saturday’s match with a double-double on 22 kills (.405 kill percentage) and 11 digs, adding three service aces for good measure. Both were far more prolific than their averages, 4.59 kills per set for Taylor and 4.13 for Ruddins.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The difference in Saturday’s match was Taylor’s support compared to Ruddins’, as three other rainbow Wahine finished with at least eight kills, while only two other Gauchos were able to accomplish the feat. Furthermore, four Gauchos finished with negative hitting percentages, all of whom participated in at least three sets.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Freshman Rainbow Wahine setter Norene Iosia slightly outplayed UCSB’s Hannah Juley, finishing with 40 assists as opposed to Juley’s 34, and completing a double-double with 15 digs while Juley could only get to four of her own.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Emilia Petrachi, the sophomore who’s arguably the Big West’s best libero, paced all players by 10 digs with 25 on the night, though only one other Gaucho was able to top double-digit digs and three members of the Hawaii team were able to do so.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Hawaii will look to move up from their 14th position in the national rankings after sweeping its weekend contests against the Gauchos and the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB will have one opportunity to conclude their season on a high note despite the sting of missing out on the playoffs with a home match against UC Irvine on Wednesday, Nov. 23 at 5 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/","id":5000,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4999,4998,4997],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel To Seattle in Search of a Second Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"If the early offensive pattern for both Seattle University and UCSB holds true, spectators can expect to see a lot of three-pointers when the two teams meet in Seattle on Friday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to truly determine a trend from only a couple games.

They have one girl who’s taken 19 threes in two games and they’ve taken only eight free throws, which is really indicative of a lot of catch-and-shoot from three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of Seattle’s offensive production, including its production from three-point land, comes from just two players: senior wing Kaylee Best and senior wing Alexis Montgomery. Best, a 5’8” senior wing, is shooting over 47 percent from long range and is averaging a Western Athletic Conference-high 21.5 points per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just need to limit (Best’s) touches,” Hendrickson said. “We need to execute ball-side deny, we need to know their personnel and where she is on the floor, and we need to keep our hands up on defense. The main thing is just going to be keeping the ball out of her hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow Montgomery has started off on fire, shooting 50 percent from three and scoring 14.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopping Best and Montgomery, or at least keeping them relatively quiet, is UCSB’s best chance at forcing the Redhawk offense to a halt. Only one other Seattle player — senior guard Claire Metoyer — is averaging over five points per game. If the Gauchos can get the ball out of Best or Montgomery’s hands, they’ll have succeeded in getting the Redhawks out of their offensive comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their two regular-season games, plus their exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles, the Gauchos have shown a definite affinity for the three, but Hendrickson isn’t planning on making that a focus on Friday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our advantage is inside, so we’ll focus on getting high percentage touches there,” Hendrickson said. “If we can do that consistently, the defense will collapse and we can kick it outside. If we can score a number of different ways it really puts pressure on the defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Redshirt junior Drew Edelman will be the key to success of Hendrickson’s game plan. The 6’4” center put up 16 points, all in the second half, to push the Gauchos past Pepperdine on Tuesday and will be the player point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and junior Drea Toler will look to funnel the ball down low to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should Hendrickson’s vision come true, and the Gauchos succeed in forcing the Redhawk defense to collapse, there will be several beneficiaries among the UCSB offense. Sophomore wing Coco Miller went off for 24 points, including five threes, against Pepperdine, and, along with guards junior Makala Roper and sophomore Sarah Porter, will be eager for kick-outs from Edelman and the other Gaucho bigs.</span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Seattle University at 7 p.m. on Friday, November 18 at KeyArena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74355\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74355\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/","id":309,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[308,307,306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Refreshing Change of Scenery: UCSB’s Conference Turnaround","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-11-MensWopo-Pepperdine-SeniorNight-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-11-MensWopo-Pepperdine-SeniorNight-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos decision to change conferences this past year might have hurt some feelings and strained some relationships, but there is no doubt that there decision to move, was the right one.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74228\" style=\"width: 677px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74228\" data-attachment-id=\"74228\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-refreshing-change-of-scenery-ucsbs-conference-turnaround/the-gauchos-get-pumped-for-the-game-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-11-MensWopo-Pepperdine-SeniorNight-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Gauchos get pumped for the game.

Such is the case for the UC Santa Barbara men’s water polo program who, after 24 years in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), made the decision to transition over to a new conference: the Golden Coast Conference (GCC).</p>\n<p>UCSB’s decision to move was influenced by many different factors, but one of the biggest was the lack of winning in the conference that was made up of the four perennial powerhouses of NCAA water polo: UCLA, USC, Cal and Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Throughout that same time span, the four big teams won every single conference tournament, with USC winning the most at nine MPSF titles and UCLA, Cal and Stanford each winning five apiece.</p>\n<p>Most notably, an MPSF water polo team has won the national title since the inception of the conference in 1992.</p>\n<p>In the 24 years the Gauchos spent in the MPSF, they never once enjoyed the luxury of taking home a conference tournament or an NCAA title.</p>\n<p>Only one team was not a part of the big four, as Pepperdine won the NCAA championship back during the 1997-98 campaign. In the other 23 years, USC again has had the most titles with nine after winning six straight titles from 2008-2013. UCLA has the second most with seven, Stanford has five and Cal wraps it up with three.</p>\n<p>With those four squads constantly dominating a water polo conference that held as many as 10 teams a year, it was hard for the Gauchos to embrace being in the middle of the pack time and time again.</p>\n<p>“We always try hard no matter what league we were in,” junior attacker Shane Hauschild said. “But it was a bit deflating not being able to go to the NCAAs just because you couldn’t beat the top two teams [in the country].”</p>\n<p>The frequent finish in the middle of the conference undoubtedly had a discouraging effect after gradually achieving upsets over some of the nation’s top teams each season. To feel like the peak of the season could be to earn a No. 4 seed in the conference tournament, then losing to the No. 1 ranked team in the country after just upsetting the No. 2 seed was demoralizing.</p>\n<p>During many years in the MPSF, teams like Santa Barbara had great seasons that ended all too soon because of one loss. UCSB has had the talent in years to defeat teams like UCLA, which it did back in 2012 during the Southern California Tournament. Before winning against the Bruins, the Gauchos also defeated the Cardinal before ultimately falling to USC in the championship.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, that result alone highlights the issue at hand. At that time, UCSB was ranked No. 6 and defeated No. 3 Stanford, then No. 2 UCLA and was expected to beat No. 1 USC all within 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The reality of the matchups were nearly implausible considering that those three aforementioned teams garnered players from other countries that already had Olympic experience on their rosters.</p>\n<p>In comparison to other sports, specifically the current college football season, No. 1 Alabama opened the season against No. 20 USC, which it routed. But the week after they weren’t expected to compete against another top-20 team, let alone a top-five opponent.</p>\n<p>It is deflating to think that the only way UCSB and other schools like Pacific, LBSU, UCI and other middle-of-the-pack teams of the MPSF could make the NCAA tournament is by having to knock off the top three teams in the country first. This is something that isn’t expected in most other collegiate sports, unless it’s in the actual NCAA Tournament, and even then it’s not always the case.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74229\" style=\"width: 426px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74229\" data-attachment-id=\"74229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-refreshing-change-of-scenery-ucsbs-conference-turnaround/tommy-fellner-passes-the-ball-to-a-teammate-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-22-16_8-web-1.jpg?fit=2400%2C1590&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1590\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tommy Fellner passes the ball to a teammate.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>That is why, after 24 years, Santa Barbara men’s water polo and Head Coach Wolf Wigo decided to make the jump and move on to a new conference, one more suitable and one that could give teams such as itself what they desired: a chance to make a run at the NCAA championship.</p>\n<p>The GCC had already established women’s water polo, which UCSB also is a member of dating back to 2013. When the circumstance emerged that many teams were looking for a new home for men’s water polo, the GCC jumped in.</p>\n<p>Moving on, just like UCSB, are Pacific, Long Beach State, UC Irvine, Pepperdine and San Jose State. Each program’s departure left only the big four schools in the MPSF, leading to the conference being in a temporarily troubled state.</p>\n<p>“We lost six of our 10 teams after they were forming a new league in an effort to find an easier path to the NCAA Tournament,” MPSF Commissioner Al Beaird said. “That did put us in a difficult bind since the NCAA requires six teams to have an automatic bid into the championship.”</p>\n<p>In order to help soften the blow, the MPSF announced on June 30 that it was able to find one more team to join the elite four and granted membership to Penn State University Behrend. Getting the fifth team, the MPSF was granted a grace period to retain an automatic qualifier for this year; however, they still will most likely lose that bid come next season.</p>\n<p>“Even if we can get six teams next year, we probably will not be able to qualify for an automatic [bid] because those six teams have to play together for a total of two years,” Beaird said. “We will have to earn our way into the tournament with at-large berths which isn’t the ideal situation, but the quality of the MPSF teams is still strong.”</p>\n<p>On the other side, despite not being able to get an automatic qualifier for the first year, UCSB was happy to be in a conference that feels more evenly matched than stacked against them.</p>\n<p>Earning immediate results, UCSB went out and proved itself in its first year.</p>\n<p>In the inaugural GCC season, the Gauchos ran away with the regular season conference title going a perfect 5-0 after defeating Pacific, LBSU, UCI, Pepperdine and San Jose State.</p>\n<p>The perfect GCC finish was UCSB’s first undefeated conference season since 1979, which coincidentally was the last time Santa Barbara won their first and only Division I NCAA title. Now, the Gauchos hold the No. 1 seed heading into the conference tournament, something they never experienced when they were in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>The newfound confidence in this Gaucho team is evident. They closed out the season winning their final seven games and 10 of the last 11. Influencing the successful finish was not having to face the challenge of playing the top-four nationally ranked talent every single game.</p>\n<p>“Having a legitimate shot of winning the conference, even if you’re a low seed, and getting a shot at the NCAA is huge,” Wigo said. “Any team in the GCC can beat a Pac-12 team, but they can’t typically win three games in a row against them, and starting next year, you win one game and suddenly you’re in the National Championship where anything can happen.”</p>\n<p>And even when they did face top talent this season, UCSB did well. Despite not beating UCLA or Cal, the Gauchos played each game pretty close. Not only that, it did knock off Stanford earlier this year to reach the No. 4 spot in the national rankings, its highest spot since 1990.</p>\n<p>Even though it’s still early and hasn’t been a full calendar year yet, it’s pretty safe to say that the Gauchos made the right decision in making the move out of the MPSF. It was not done out of spite or hate but instead out of what was truly better for UCSB’s program going forward.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t in their best interest for us to leave, but it was in all our best interests, and I think it’s in the best interest of the sport,” Wigo said. “They were a little upset at first, but anyone not in the MPSF would recognize it was a good move.”</p>\n<p>Even though most coaches declined to be interviewed for this piece — most of them due to the fact they were getting ready for the MPSF Tournament this week — it is clear there is still a respect among all the coaches, especially due to the fact they still all scheduled to play each other.</p>\n<p>“We do some joint scheduling and ensured that coaches from both conferences and commissioners like myself maintain those relationships, because having that competition is important to both conferences.” Beaird said.</p>\n<p>Overall, although the move did hurt the MPSF a bit, it is clear that this was the right thing for the Gauchos to do. The confidence that has peaked in this team — as it knows that it can win its conference year in and year out — is apparent especially in seniors who have experienced UCSB’s past before its present state.</p>\n<p>“It’s great that we now have that confidence of going undefeated during season,” senior attacker Mitchell Hamilton said. “And it really helps drive us to win those last two games [conference tournament] and win our division.”</p>\n<p>It is underwhelming to stay in the same middle of the pack each year, never feeling like you are living up to the true potential that lives inside you as it does in every person, every family and every team.</p>\n<p>Like UCSB proved, moving forward and pivoting from that same old structure could make the difference by you not only living up to your potential, but also finding that confidence to be as happy as you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

night in which LeBron James sat out the second game of a back-to-back trip, the Cleveland Cavaliers remain the best team in the NBA thus far.</p>\n<p>The mission to “Defend the Land” has been placed in full drive with the Cavs, who once again look like the clear favorite to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals come June.</p>\n<p>The journey to repeat as NBA champions is no guarantee, but through 11 games — 10 of which have been against Eastern Conference opponents — the Cavs are 9-2. Most notably, they have defeated two of the East’s projected top contenders: the Toronto Raptors (twice this season) and the Boston Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its first defeat, the Cavs’ 6-0 start stands as the best team start in LeBron James’s career, having reached the 5-1 mark a total of three times in two consecutive seasons with Miami in 2012 and 2013 in addition to last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>\n<p>The end result of each season that started 5-1? Three NBA championship titles.</p>\n<p>It was the second-best start in franchise history, falling short of the 1976-77 Cavaliers’ 8-0 start.</p>\n<p>Although records don’t tell all about a team, Cleveland’s current squad could be the best team that has ever surrounded James, who is currently in his 10th season with the franchise since returning in 2014.</p>\n<p>Despite still being in his prime, at 31 years old James faces the reality of father time creeping up, considering the retirements of basketball legends Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett this past season and offseason.</p>\n<p>Although the King’s dethronement isn’t expected anytime soon, having recently surpassed NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon for 10th place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, the Cavaliers’ hometown superstar has about four to six years remaining in his career.</p>\n<p>It is a time span that reinforces the same message since his return to Cleveland: Win now.</p>\n<p>No one can predict what the Cavaliers will become post-LeBron, especially after the additions made in recent years, but it is likely the team will lose its value as a top contender. The immediate decline in wins from 2010-2014, occurring during James’s stint with the Heat, was more than enough evidence that it must build around their star player.</p>\n<p>The first step toward rebuilding during those four seasons was the selection of Kyrie Irving with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA with a foot injury and offset by other nagging injuries throughout his career, the most significant being his fractured kneecap in game one of the 2015 NBA Finals, Irving slightly became a forgotten cause as a player with the potential to be one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>Despite Irving earning the 2011-12 Rookie of the Year award and being known for his ability to score, a lack of acknowledgment for his game still remained.</p>\n<p>After LeBron James signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension during the 2014 offseason, his unexpected return that same year has worked in the favor of Irving ever since.</p>\n<p>Playing in just 53 games last season after recovering from the previous year’s knee injury, Irving has excelled, proving his ability to take over on the game’s biggest stage in the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Convincing many that he outplayed the two-time NBA MVP Steph Curry in the series, averaging 27.1 points per game and scoring the game-winning three-point dagger in his face to secure Cleveland’s first-ever title, Irving used the postseason to remind and prove to the world he is one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>It was obvious then, and it is obvious now that without Irving the Cavaliers cannot win an NBA championship.</p>\n<p>Whenever it seems like the Cavs are down and out on the brink of defeat, it is Irving who has stepped up as the team’s savior when even James wouldn’t be expected to prevail.</p>\n<p>Although other players such as J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Kevin Love and more play pivotal roles in the Cavs’ success as well, the tandem of Irving and James has formulated a one-two punch that is capable of carrying Cleveland to future title victories.</p>\n<p>The pairing of the two has helped reduce the pressures on James and provides Cleveland with an option to stay within winning games as the team’s leader rests.<br>\nFor purposes of rest, James intentionally sat out for the first time this season in the Cavs’ game against the Pacers.</p>\n<p>In addition to scoring the ball well, ranking third in the league in scoring at 109 PPG, Cleveland has remained consistent on defense, allowing 103.5 PPG. Despite the average, the Cavs have allowed 100-plus points in just six of their 11 games this season.</p>\n<p>Although the Golden State Warriors, considered Cleveland’s rival as we anticipate a third-consecutive Finals meeting between the two, are a team capable of going back and forth in a shootout with any team, their occasional lapses on defense detract from their league-leading 117.3 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Warriors are tied for allowing the seventh highest opponent PPG average at 109.3. In comparison to Cleveland’s six games, Golden State has allowed 100-plus points in nine of its 11 games.</p>\n<p>It is true the Warriors are still adjusting to their addition of former NBA MVP Kevin Durant and the departures of primary role players Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut, but Golden State must find a way to resolve its inconsistencies, which mainly fall on it becoming smaller around the key and paint areas.</p>\n<p>One can only hope another Cavs-Warriors championship matchup will take place. After leading in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks in the NBA Finals, if James and co. were able to defeat the self-embraced “Super Villains” of Golden State, he would achieve the ultimate victory that would earn him a nod in surpassing two of the game’s greatest in Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Much is still to occur throughout this season. There will be phases during which Cleveland will look like the best team or falter to its high expectations, preventing the prediction of the Cavs winning it all in 2016-17.</p>\n<p>It’s a game-by-game process in which teams continue to develop, even in the case of the Cleveland Cavaliers heading into year three of James being back at the helm. Their “All In” mentality is a motto that persists in the championship-or-bust expectations that have become standard for fans such as ourselves to judge accordingly.</p>\n<p>All stats are accurate as of Nov. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/","id":3338,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3337,3336,3335],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Poised for Success, On Road for Conf.

Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Thanks to their 5-0 conference record, the Gauchos were able to lock up the No. 1 seed in the tournament and will have a bye for the first round. Their most formidable opponent will most likely be No. 5 Pacific, who has the No. 2 seed in the tournament and holds the home field advantage, but they have already beaten the Tigers at their own home 13-9.</p>\n<p>If UCSB ends up playing Pacific, that match won’t happen until the championship round on Sunday. Instead, Santa Barbara will face off against the lowest seed of the Friday match winners on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are led by many key players such as senior utility Reed Cotterill, who ranks third in the conference in goals with 43. Senior goalkeeper Liam Lenihan has also been great in the cage, posting 154 saves this year — third most in the GCC — and has not allowed double-digit goals in the last seven outings.</p>\n<p>The possible opponents the Gauchos can face in the first round are No. 9 Pepperdine, No. 19 UC Irvine or unranked San Jose State, the only team in this tournament that is not currently ranked in the NCAA national rankings. These three teams are the No. 4, 5 and 6 seed in the competition, respectively.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Pepperdine would be the most likely matchup on Saturday, and, if so, the Gauchos hold the advantage as they have beaten the Waves three times this season, each time scoring at least 10 goals in the game.</p>\n<p>In those three victories, UCSB has outscored its opponent 35-23 and has defeated them once in a neutral site, once on the road and once at home. Just this past Friday, the Gauchos clinched their 5-0 record by defeating Pepperdine 10-8 in front of their home crowd.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest keys for Santa Barbara in that match will be shutting down the offensive powerhouse that is attacker Marko Asic. The 6’1” sophomore currently leads the conference in goals with a whopping 62, 16 more than any other player, and is also second in total points with 71.</p>\n<p>During the match against UCSB last Friday, Asic scored five of the team’s eight goals, including three in the third quarter, to help bring his team back from what could’ve been a blowout.</p>\n<p>If they face UCI, revenge will be on the mind of the Gauchos as last year’s loss in the MPSF tournament is still very fresh and allowed the Anteaters to finish with a higher place at the end of the competition.</p>\n<p>This season UC Irvine has struggled mightily, posting a 9-13 regular season and only a 2-3 GCC record in the inaugural season. If it doesn’t win at least one match this postseason, then it would have its worst winning percentage in a single season since the 2006 campaign when it posted a .35 winning percentage (12-22).</p>\n<p>San Jose State would be the easiest opponent the Gauchos could face, but that doesn’t mean they should underestimate them. The Spartans have the lowest seed because of their winless conference season but has the necessary players to pull off an upset against LBSU in its opening round match.</p>\n<p>SJSU’s best player is actually the brother of Santa Barbara’s own Shane Hauschild. Ben Hauschild has been a great addition for a very young Spartan team, especially on the defensive side. His 49 steals are the most in conference this year, and he has 23 goals and seven assists to go with that.</p>\n<p>No matter whom they face, the Gauchos will be ready. This is the first time in over 20 years they can say they are the favorites, and that excites not just the coaches and players, but fans as well.</p>\n<p>UCSB starts its postseason run at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 19 at Pacific’s Chris Kjeldsen Aquatics Complex, against whom to be determined.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 17 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Hawaii hasn’t lost since an overtime match with Long Beach State on Oct. 8, and it dominated the last match against UCSB in straight sets, 25-20, 25-14, 25-19. The Rainbow Wahine have only dropped one set since the LBSU match and have now swept seven straight league opponents, including that same 49ers team two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Rainbow Wahine senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor has been one of the league’s premier scorers this season, racking up 4 kills per set in conference play. She’s aided by sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato and middle hitters senior Annie Mitchem and junior Emily Maglio, each of whom rank in the top 25 for kills per set against Big West competition with at least 2.20.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Maglio paces all players with a .409 kill percentage against conference competition, as she’s been good for 100 kills and only 17 errors over the span. Mitchem also ranks fourth with a .353 hitting percentage, completing what has been a ferociously efficient duo in the middle for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos, Hawaii also relies on first-year setter Norene Iosia. UCSB’s redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley and Iosia have put up very similar stats through their respective Big West schedules, as Iosia barely trails Juley’s mark of 10.35 assists per set with 10.20 of her own.</p>\n<p>Iosia is coming off double-doubles in her last two matches, with 33 assists and 12 digs against UC Davis following a 28 assist and 11 dig effort against UC Irvine,</p>\n<p>Hawaii is one of two teams in the Big West without a player averaging four digs per set in conference play, though junior libero Savanah Kahakai’s 3.96 figure is just shy of the mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi and every one of her 4.59 digs per set against Big West foes Saturday, as she presents a situation where UCSB may have a talent advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue to ride the offensive shockwaves of their redshirt first-years Lindsey Ruddins and Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>Ruddins has been seventh-best in kills per set during Big West play, averaging 3.70. While she was relatively shut down with 12 kills in the match against UC Riverside, Ruddins had 27 kills in a monster outing against Cal State Fullerton the night before, showing just how deadly she can be.</p>\n<p>Juley had 94 assists over this past weekend, 47 in each match, and will have to be on her A-game for the Gauchos to have a shot against the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>She’s been on an upward trajectory throughout the year, a trend that will need to continue for the first-year if UCSB is to have any hope of their postseason dreams becoming reality.</p>\n<p>Mindset will be important for the Gauchos heading into the final two matches. With their playoff hopes lingering in uncertainty, intensity is a focus for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We can go into this with absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “An aggressive mindset is absolutely what we need.”</p>\n<p>Relating to gains throughout their season, UCSB’s best weekends this year have come after stretches of great practices, a trend that was shaken last week.</p>\n<p>“Over the last month, every week we’ve had great practices except for last week,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “They know that, they recognize that and they realize how important that is and how much it carries over to the games. The key is that we just stay confident.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and maintain that confidence and defeat a Hawaii team that has appeared, at times, unbeatable.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to breathe some fire back into their season on Saturday night, facing off against Hawaii at 9 p.m. Pacific time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November, 17 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74290\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74290\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/","id":4999,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4998,4997,4996],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns First Victory in Home Opener Behind Miller’s 24 Points","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite having a lower field goal percentage than its opponent in Pepperdine, the UCSB women's basketball team managed to earn its first win of the season with its three-point shooting and attack in t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a rewarding ending at the Thunderdome for the UCSB women’s basketball team Tuesday night as it defeated Pepperdine 66-57 in its home opener.

Nearly all of her field goals in the game were from three-point distance except one jumpshot as she ended the game 6-15 from the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman emerged big in the second half. After no shot attempts in the first half due to two fouls limiting her to play for just four minutes, Edelman recorded all 12 of her field goal attempts in the game’s last 20 minutes. Her domination of the paint led to her finishing with 16 points on 8-12 shooting to go with five rebounds and one block. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was definitely exciting to not be in foul trouble anymore,” Edelman said. “My teammates are great about throwing me the ball. When they kick it in and I’m getting double teamed, I can kick it out and I know that Coco will knock down an open shot. It’s definitely a good thing we have going.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to penetrate the paint to open up shots on the perimeter worked out the gates as Miller drained a three to give UCSB its first points of the games. The deep make ignite the Gauchos’ 5-0 run to start the first quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the 7:01 mark of the period, Pepperdine had earned its first lead, responding with a 9-0 run of its own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the Waves’ scoring charge were their guard tandem of redshirt freshman Sydney Bordonaro and senior Allie Green. Hitting her first three-pointer of the game during the run, Bordonaro scored five points to contribute to her team-high total of 15 points on 6-12 overall and 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green scored the other four during the scoring stretch, ending the game with 12 points on 4-11 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB gained its first double-figure lead of 21-11 during its 10-0 run that carried over from the end of the first to the second period. It earned its largest lead of 14 points at 27-13 as a result of a made layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB pressured the Waves’ offense into turning the ball over a total of 22 times, but was inefficient in capitalizing on its opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite shooting 6-16  from three-point range in the first two quarters, the Gauchos struggled inside the three-point line and had issues converting on their forced turnovers, going 3-18 on layups in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you miss a wide open layup, you’re focused on the wrong thing,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “You’re wide open, you’ve got to finish. We missed nine [wide open layups]. We just absolutely didn’t reward our defense for opportunities in transition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inconsistencies in transition ultimately led to Santa Barbara’s being held scoreless in the remaining 5:47 of the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pepperdine embarked on a 9-0 run to end the first half, trimming the Gauchos’ lead to 27-22 at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first tie of the game occurred at the 7:42 mark of the third quarter as Pepperdine’s Green had an open left lane to the basket, knotting the game at 29-29. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping improve the Gauchos’ 24.3 field goal percentage was their improvements in shot selection in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a balance to UCSB’s three-point attack was its emphasis on getting the ball to the paint in the second half. It attempted just eight three-point attempts, finishing the game 8-24 from downtown, and displayed its commitment to Edelman early. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to feed Edelman in the paint was beneficial as she ended the third quarter with 10 points on 4-7 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A three-pointer by Porter just 30 seconds into the fourth quarter regained a double-figure lead for UCSB, building its lead to 45-34.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoring eight of her 12 total points in the fourth quarter of the game was Pepperdine’s sophomore forward Yasmine Robinson-Bacote. Able to convert on an and-1 opportunity Robinson-Bacote after a successful drive to the hoop, bringing the Waves’ deficit to 51-44.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A steal followed by a go-ahead layup by sophomore guard Paige Fecske allowed the Waves to stay in contention, trailing 58-51, as they called a timeout after the field goal with 51 seconds remaining.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of Pepperdine closing in on their lead, the Gauchos managed to secure their first victory at the free throw line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB kept its poise at the line, making 13-21 free throws in the fourth quarter alone as it ended 16-25. Miller and senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe led UCSB in its foul shooting, making a combined 13-18 from the line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An arid pass out of bounds by Bordonaro followed by a turnover in Pepperdine’s final two possessions of the game allowed UCSB to milk the clock in the game’s remaining 12 seconds, finalizing UCSB’s 66-57 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will hope to maintain their momentum on the road at Seattle University tonight at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74360\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74360\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/","id":312,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[311,310,309],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"To Silence the Voice of the Voiceless?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CHecks-and-Balances1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CHecks-and-Balances1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It's hard being an athlete but it's only made harder when you have critics are constantly trying to silence your voice.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fear, happiness, anxiety, shock.

The teams also wore shirts in memory of the five victims of the Dallas shooting.</p>\n<p>The WNBA fined the three teams (the New York Liberty, the Indiana Fever and the Phoenix Mercury) $5,000 each, and each player was fined $500 for violating the league’s uniform policy.</p>\n<p>The WNBA later rescinded the fines and vouched support for the players’ protest, but the initial punishment is exactly the type of action that prevents and intimidates players from attempting to use their platform to make their political statements.</p>\n<p>No matter what the political views or stances are that athletes desire to use their platforms to advocate for, the leagues must commit to providing an environment for athletes to utilize their First Amendment rights and demonstrate if they choose to do so without fear of reprisal.</p>\n<p>Players like the ones in the WNBA, Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are no different from the likes of celebrated athletic and cultural icons like Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos.</p>\n<p>These players from the past and present have used their platform and influence to evoke change, not because of a need to boost their own profile, but to serve the basic human desire to speak out against something that is unjust and unfair.</p>\n<p>These players deserve to be seen as people, not just athletes, who patriotically utilize their First Amendment rights to take a stand despite criticism from the public or even their own league.</p>\n<p>All athletes from across the country, whether at the professional, collegiate or high school level, deserve an environment conducive to exercise their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>“In any protest, I think you make a statement to try and reach the far ends of the Earth. What better way to do it than if you’re in a sport,” Carlos said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 17, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74273\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74273\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/","id":1921,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1920,1919,1918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Swim Prepares for A3 Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The men and women's gaucho swim teams are back to action this week in the annual A-3 Invitational.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74227\" style=\"width: 502px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74227\" data-attachment-id=\"74227\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-swim-prepares-for-a3-invite/11-05-swim-ucsd-ericswensonnexus-8-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"11-05-swim-ucsd-ericswensonnexus-8-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74227\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web-1024x684.jpg?resize=492%2C329\" alt=\"Melissa Mullis jumps off the block for the backstroke event.

Junior guard Gabe Vincent led in UCSB points that game, scoring 18 in his 37 minutes of play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Vincent has been a constant source of leadership for the Gaucho team along with senior Eric Childress, each scoring 12 and 10 points, respectively, in the Omaha-Nebraska game. These two guards make plays and take shots, pushing along the speed of play.</p>\n<p>Childress played hard all 34 minutes that he was on the court, coming away with four defensive rebounds as well as four assists. Despite Santa Barbara accounting for 18 total turnovers in their opener, Childress was a bright spot only turning the ball over twice.</p>\n<p>An up-and-coming power player for the Gauchos is redshirt sophomore forward Ami Lakoju.

In addition to an offensive rebound, he managed to grab five defensive boards as well.</p>\n<p>Lakoju first gave the UCSB fans a glimpse of his abilities in an exhibition game against Fresno Pacific where he made three baskets in under one minute.

Having worked his way to a starting position this season, the former Serbian U-20 Men’s National Team player scored nine against the Flames along with four assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>Two returning starters, forwards Nate Renfro and Chase Foster, stand to step up into bigger leadership roles this year. Last season they only scored a combined three points against the Gauchos. Now that their top dogs are gone, it is their chance to show the team just what kind of players they are.</p>\n<p>As a freshman last year, Renfro shot 51.2 percent and had 19 blocks on the year, proving his capability as a starter. Against Illinois-Chicago, he scored 12 points over 27 minutes along with three assists.</p>\n<p>Foster came away with eight points, shooting 4-9 against the Flames. During the 2015-16 season, the Colorado native made 27 three-pointers and played in all 30 games.</p>\n<p>Senior Ronnie Boyce shone brightly as a leader against the Illinois-Chicago, scoring 28 points in 26 minutes of playing time, 13 points more than any other player on the court. Boyce, a guard originally from Oklahoma, will definitely be a player to watch.</p>\n<p>Transferring to USF as a junior in 2015, he earned his position as third-leading scorer on the team, including a career-high 25 point performance away with a career high of 25 points, a personal record he has already beat in just the first game of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>In last year’s UCSB-USF game, Boyce played only two minutes. Judging by his performance last week, the Gauchos will most likely be seeing plenty of him.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams faced-off, UCSB may have won, but the Dons fought it to the end, scoring six points in the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>Having just lost at home, the Gauchos will be looking to turn around that 0-1 record at the Thunderdome on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74256\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74256\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/","id":310,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[309,308,307],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Weekend Split Might Have Dashed Postseason Hopes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB split its weekend series after defeating Cal Poly, but falling flat against UCR in a tough match.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74168\" style=\"width: 656px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74168\" data-attachment-id=\"74168\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/wvball_vsucr-161112-dustinharris-06-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"wvball_vsucr-161112-dustinharris-06-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74168\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=646%2C431\" alt=\"After missing a block in the middle, Megan Rice, Phoebe Grunt and Chloe Allen struggle for the ball.

Cal State Fullerton proved to be a worthy opponent despite their 1-11 Big West record (6-20 overall) entering the match, outlasting the Gauchos 27-25 in the first set.</p>\n<p>UCSB was taking no part in a close contest for the rest of the match, however, as a 10-point run to start the second set led to the Gauchos holding the Titans under 18 in each of the final three games.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense was immaculate in those three sets, as Cal State Fullerton wasn’t able to hit above .185, plummeting in the third set with a -.077 kill percentage and seven errors. UCSB’s offense also steadily improved throughout the match, peaking in the final set when it hit .387 with only two errors.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins was in spectacular form throughout the evening, compiling 27 kills with only four errors, a .411 kill percentage and 15 digs, completing yet another double-double. A career-high in kills for the outside hitter, Ruddins also provided five service aces and was by far the most dominant player on the court.</p>\n<p>She was aided heavily by fellow redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley, who also contributed a double-double with 14 digs and a match-high 47 assists. Juley was also feeling it from the service line, joining Ruddins and redshirt sophomore Sydney Bast as the three Gaucho players with at least three aces.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi topped 20 digs for the second-straight match, finishing with 21 on the evening and providing the defensive spark that allowed the Gauchos to dominate after a shaky first set.</p>\n<p>Sophomores outside hitter Madeline Schneider, middle blocker Summer Kerins and outside hitter Shimen Fayad each had at least eight kills for the Titans, though Fayad was the only player to breach double-digits with 13.</p>\n<p>Fayad was able to notch a double-double as well with 11 digs, second most on the team to first-year defensive specialist Madisen Babich’s 16. Freshman setter Rachel Hall was also impressive throughout, her 37 assists good for just under 10 per set.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos riding a tremendous hot streak, heading into their match versus UC Riverside appeared an easy task for the ascending Gauchos as UCR is second to last in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>UCSB would take a close opening set 25-23, a late Riverside run giving the Gauchos their first scare of the night, as they had held the fellow UC at a comfortable distance for most of the game. The Highlanders controlled the second, though a late 7-2 run from the Gauchos, including two of first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s eight kills, brought UCSB within two.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside had little trouble finishing the job, however, as two kills from junior middle blocker Meg Graham contributed to a comfortable second-set Highlander victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to turn the corner in the third, playing one of their best sets of the season on the way to a 25-9 win. UCSB hit .400 in the game, compared to a -.172 for the Highlanders, and forced 10 turnovers while limiting itself to only one.</p>\n<p>After gaining a 15-11 advantage in the fourth, a six-point Riverside run proved sufficient to force a fifth set. They carried their momentum into the tie-breaker, grabbing an early 9-5 lead before a quick four-point retort from the Gauchos locked the teams in yet another draw.</p>\n<p>A 6-2 run by the Highlanders clinched the match as the Gauchos fell just short and dropped to two games behind Cal Poly for third place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Emilia Petrachi again paced the Gauchos with 21 digs, her third-straight match with 20-plus. Lindsey Ruddins, Megan Rice, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt, senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen all had at least eight kills, though Allen’s hitting percentage of .242 was the highest of the bunch, as errors were a steady issue for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley had 47 digs for the second-straight match, eight more than UC Riverside’s sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle. Doyle completed a double-double with 14 digs, and was one of four Highlanders with at least 13.</p>\n<p>One of those four was senior outside hitter Cristina Maietta, whose 14 digs, 17 kills and two aces accounted for a large portion of her team’s production. Four UCR players also had at least 10 kills, including middle blockers Meg Graham and junior Brooke Callahan, as well as first-year outside hitter Mickayla Sherman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ postseason hopes took a major hit this weekend, but the team will still try to finish the season on a positive note with its final two matches next week.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to Hawaii Saturday, Nov.13 for its second match against the Rainbow Wahine before hosting UC Irvine Wednesday, Nov. 23 for the final match of the 2016 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74177\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74177\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/","id":4995,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4994,4993,4992],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":65,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
