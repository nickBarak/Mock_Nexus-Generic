The Gauchos are currently ranked in fourth place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation alongside Long Beach State. The Anteaters hold a record of 10-8 (7-7) and are tied for eighth place with Stanford in the MPSF. The UCSD Tritons will host the Gauchos without having had a single win yet, with a record of 0-15 (0-14 MPSF). UCSD is currently in last place in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Coming out 2-0 this week would be huge,” senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson said. “Irvine is a really good team.

Earlier this season when UCSB hosted UCI, they lost to the Anteaters in a dramatic fifth set ending. UCSB held a 13-12 lead and reached match-point with a kill from senior opposite Evan Licht, but multiple attacking errors from UCSB allowed Irvine to score five points and take the game.</p>\n<p>In order to be a dominant force this weekend, UCSB will not only need to keep its attacking errors at a minimum, but will also need to demonstrate strong serving and passing.</p>\n<p>“We did well on the serve and pass last week against Stanford, we just didn’t execute other parts of our game plan,” junior outside hitter Kevin Donohue said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also need to keep a close eye on UCI’s junior opposite Zack La Cavera. La Cavera is currently leading Irvine with 205 kills on the season and a team-high 21 service aces. La Cavera was responsible for most of the kills that stole the win from the Gauchos back in January.</p>\n<p>“In order to get the win against Irvine we need to win the serve and pass and come out with a lot of energy and make sure we sustain that energy through the final point,” sophomore libero Parker Boehle said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their trip down the coast to San Diego on Saturday night. Aside from having lost all of their matches this season, the Tritons do possess some standout individuals. Nick Iorfino and Mike Brunsting are the driving forces behind the UCSD offense. Brunsting is also leading the Tritons serving game, with 11 service aces on the season.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I can really say about San Diego at this point is that they have a tough gym to play in,” Thompson said. “With that being said, we shouldn’t take the game lightly because that is when we get ourselves into trouble.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UCI on Friday night, followed by UCSD on Saturday. Both matches are scheduled for 7 p.m. start times.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Kodelashvili of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54240\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-6-gauchos-travel-to-no-9-uc-irvine-last-place-ucsd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54240\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-6-gauchos-travel-to-no-9-uc-irvine-last-place-ucsd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-6-gauchos-travel-to-no-9-uc-irvine-last-place-ucsd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-6-gauchos-travel-to-no-9-uc-irvine-last-place-ucsd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-6-gauchos-travel-to-no-9-uc-irvine-last-place-ucsd/","id":5290,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5289,5288,5287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Continue Strong Start to Season Against Princeton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSBbaseball-1_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSBbaseball-1_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Coming off a road victory over defending national champion UCLA, the UCSB baseball team hosts Princeton University for a four-game series this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It is always a big story when David defeats Goliath, no matter how early it is in the season.

The win marked the first road victory against the Bruins since 2011 and the program’s first win against a defending champ since 1999.</p>\n<p>In that game, Santa Barbara had a solid outing from sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza who went into the sixth inning allowing only two runs to the potent Bruin offense. UCSB also benefitted from timely hitting by junior infielders Tyler Kuresa and Pete Maris who each went deep: Together they accounted for five of UCSB’s six runs in the game.</p>\n<p>So far in the season, the Gauchos have relied on its bullpen to get them out of trouble in late game situations. Sophomore Dillon Tate has converted on both of his save opportunities and junior Greg Mahle is developing into a reliable setup man for Tate. Before Tuesday’s game, the bullpen came in with a 2.40 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB has been on an offensive tear as of late, as it has put up a combined 16 runs in its past two games. Senior third baseman Joey Epperson has excelled at the top of the lineup and leads the team with a .450 batting average, while Kuresa has been the Gaucho’s power hitter with two homeruns in five games.</p>\n<p>In its first game of the season, Princeton enters looking to improve on last year’s 14-28 finish where the team was mostly hurt by its fielding errors; the Tigers had the most in their conference with 74.</p>\n<p>Although being among the middle of the conference in batting average and ERA last season, the Tigers return players capable of becoming big threats this season. Senior infielder/outfielder Alec Keller batted .378 with four homeruns and will be counted on to lead the offensive production for the young Princeton squad this year.</p>\n<p>Another potential threat in the lineup of the Tigers is sophomore infielder Danny Hoy who managed a .307 batting average to go along with 21 RBIs and two homers.</p>\n<p>On the mound, sophomore Cameron Mingo will have to step up for the Tigers after the loss of their two best pitchers from last year. The right-handed pitcher posted an ERA of 2.92 and 1-4 record last season and is one of the best prospects in the Tiger’s conference.</p>\n<p>Friday’s opening game at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium is scheduled for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54236\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54236\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/","id":4437,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4436,4435,4434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Face San Jose State on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels north to face San Jose State after notching its first conference victory last week against Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a strong conference win recorded last Saturday against Cal State Fullerton, the UCSB women’s tennis team looks to carry the momentum to the Bay Area, where it will face San Jose State this Saturday.</p>\n<p>After defeating Fullerton last weekend, the Gauchos improved to 2-7 overall with a conference record of 1-1, while San Jose St. currently sits with a 4-8 record.</p>\n<p>UCSB, which received its first win after a five-match losing skid, has been focusing heavily on making its team stronger and healthier.

We’ve been working on our doubles play and our consistency in our singles play. We’ve been working on being aggressive when the opportunities present themselves.”</p>\n<p>The Spartans find themselves on a two-game winning streak, but previously fell into a horrific losing streak of seven games. In their last two matches however, they have beaten difficult opponents in Cal Poly and Pacific.</p>\n<p>In its last match, San Jose State uprooted Pacific in a commanding 5-2 victory. UCSB lost to Pacific in a tough decision on Feb. 16 by a 6-1 margin.</p>\n<p>Starting at first doubles for the Spartans is freshman Marie Klocker who has had an impressive first year. In Klocker’s match against Cal Poly, she displayed a superb sequence of endurance defeating her opponent 7-6, 3-6, 6-0. A very impressive stat comes from Spartan senior Sabastian Leon Chao who won her 119th match against Cal Poly; with that victory Chao boosted herself to second place all-time on the Spartan’s career win list.</p>\n<p>This is without a doubt a strong and imposing Spartan team; UCSB will have to arrive riding the taste of victory it received from its impressive win at Fullerton. The Gauchos have been in a season-long pursuit for improved mental strength and physical stamina. If Santa Barbara can harvest these two components, then it has a good chance of gaining the advantage over San Jose St. this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The biggest challenge will be dealing with various injuries, which can lead to some confidence issues,” Scatliffe said. “Everyone is doing their best to stay or get healthy and compete as hard as possible no matter what obstacles we face.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are set to take the courts this Saturday at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54230\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54230\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/","id":746,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[745,744,743],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts No. 71 Nevada, Pacific to Begin Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces Pacific this weekend, the team it beat in last year's Big West Tournament championship game.

The top doubles pairs will consist of Echargui and Mege, Ouvrard and freshman Robert Allan and Poustie with junior Fernando Sunago.</p>\n<p>“Nevada has a lot of international players, very steady, don’t make a lot of unforced errors and [they are] very good,” Davis said. “I expect it to be a very close match.”</p>\n<p>Nevada played Pepperdine last night and will return home for a stretch of matches at its home court after playing UCSB.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Pacific will be coming into Santa Barbara looking for vengeance after the Gauchos knocked the Tigers out of the Big West Tournament last spring. Though no longer in the Big West Conference, the Tigers will be another tough test for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Tigers are 3-5 overall and won their last match over Sacramento State 7-0. They will be playing Cal Poly on Saturday before coming down the 101 to take on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We edged this team in the finals last year for the conference title,” Davis said. “They aren’t in our conference anymore but I’m sure they will all remember that. I’m sure they’ll be looking for some revenge.”</p>\n<p>Pacific is led by its star sophomore Sem Verbeek. Verbeek was named Big West Conference Freshman of the Year in 2013.

UCSB is 18-7 overall and has won two straight games, while Irvine is 18-10, previously losing its one-game lead on the Gauchos with a loss to Cal State Northridge last Saturday. Needless to say, tonight’s game in Irvine holds major implications for both teams’ chances to finish on top of the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“I think they’re pretty confident in themselves when we play high level teams and competition,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve played well in big games this year; we played well in the preseason at UNLV and Cal, UCLA and Colorado.

In that victory, however, Irvine was without junior forward Will Davis II, last year’s Big West Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“He’s a key player for them, no doubt. He’s not one of the top three scorers, but what he is, is a really versatile four/five,” Coach Williams said. “Even though you don’t see him at the five much, I think you will see him at times at the five today. I think you’ll see them go to a small team, press us, play small with the five, and it gives them way more versatility than with their big guys they have.”</p>\n<p>Another player to watch for Irvine is freshman Mamadou Ndiaye. The 7’6” freshman is the tallest player in collegiate basketball and ranks 8th in the nation with 3.19 blocks to per game. Irvine features much depth along its starting line with freshman guard Luke Nelson and senior guard Chris McNealy each averaging over 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>Because of its depth, Irvine has played well of late, as the Anteaters were winners of five straight games before falling to Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the test against Irvine,” Coach Williams said. “We’re sure that they will play much better than when they played here against us, and I think we’re ready for the challenge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game with plenty of momentum as well, winning six of its last seven games; the lone loss coming in overtime to the same Northridge team. Leading the Gauchos is junior center Alan Williams. Big Al leads the nation with 12.0 rebounds per game and ranks 8th in the country with 22.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Part of [his rebounding ability is] he creates space, but the other part of it is he’s leaner, he’s moving really well, he’s got great instincts, he follows where the ball is going and he reads it really well,” Coach Williams said. “He’s just got great gifts, tremendous feet, tremendous hands, he’s a very good player.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have come to expect greatness from Big Al, another player in junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has emerged as a game-changer for a UCSB team hitting its stride. Harmon ranks second in the nation with a 4.52 assist to turnover ratio and is second in the conference with over 5.2 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Even more impressive, Harmon has compiled 50 assists and only three turnovers in his last nine games. In addition to his superb ball handling, Harmon has also become an efficient scorer for the Gauchos, notching two 20-point games in the last three contests. In the team’s last game, Harmon racked up 20 points and 10 assists, the first Gaucho to accomplish the feat since 1989.</p>\n<p>“He continues to get better. He makes great decisions and takes great care of the ball, obviously,” Coach Williams said. “He’s shooting the ball with much more confidence now, he’s playing his best basketball of the year and we just kind of expect him to continue to grow.”</p>\n<p>No doubt that on Saturday the Gauchos will rely on what has been working for them all year — feeding Big Al down low and relying on its perimeter shooters to hit outside shots and drive to the rim for open looks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to play tremendous defense against an Irvine squad that ranks first in the conference in field goal percentage at 47.5 percent. Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to under 36 percent in the victory earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounding and will challenge Big Al, the nation’s top rebounder, down low. In the team’s previous matchup, Big Al managed to dominate as he has done all season with 26 points and 10 rebounds, with the Gauchos winning the battle on the glass by eight.</p>\n<p>“There’s high energy, a lot of emotion in this game because it is such a big game and the environment is going to be hostile and they always bring a good crowd,” Big Al said. “It’s definitely going to be a lot of fun to play there and go up against Irvine. We’re really excited. It’s a big game.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s clash between the first-place teams is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center in Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54257\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54257\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/","id":546,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[545,544,543],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Anteaters After Snapping Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in eighth place in the Big West and will try to win its second straight game Thursday night against Irvine.

We may look to double, and that’s just out of respect for what she can do when she gets the ball.”</p>\n<p>Following Buckley’s lead, the Anteaters rank second in the conference in scoring during league play at 73.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams met up in Irvine, Buckley was the biggest reason her team came away with the 77-60 victory. Buckley was dominant, scoring 27 points on 7-12 shooting, including 13-15 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>She also grabbed 15 rebounds, aiding the Anteaters in winning the rebounding battle 43-28. Santa Barbara currently ranks last in the Big West in rebounding at just 33.9 boards on the season. The statistic carries significant weight in the win-loss column too, with the Gauchos getting 39.9 rebounds in wins compared to 31.1 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure [Buckley] doesn’t touch it,” junior center Clair Watkins said. “That’d be the easiest way to make sure she doesn’t score. It’s going to be up to the post players to stay lower than her and be physical with her.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB will throw multiple defensive looks at Buckley, Watkins will earn plenty of time on the dominant senior. She comes off a solid weekend herself in which she earned her first double-double last Saturday in Santa Barbara’s win over Cal State Fullerton. She scored 10 points and tallied 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton was more finesse and Clair had to guard guards and three-point shooters,” Mitchell said. “Now it’ll be a physical game, so I’ll be interested to see how she does because I think she’s understanding now that that’s what we have to have from her. That was the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Last weekend, the Gauchos split their games, losing to last-place UC Riverside in the team’s most devastating loss of the year before rebounding for a victory over Fullerton. While inconsistency continued to plague the Gauchos in Riverside, UCSB came out strong and sustained its energy for the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>“We all were upset about the Riverside game, but we went into Fullerton with a chip on our shoulder and came out with a lot of energy,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “That’s what won us the game, so if we come with that same energy and mindset for Irvine, I think we should win the game.”</p>\n<p>With three of the team’s final games at home, Santa Barbara has the opportunity to try to improve its seed for the conference tournament. At 8-17 overall and 3-9 in the Big West, UCSB currently stands in the eighth and final playoff spot, 1.5 games up on UC Riverside. Fullerton sits in a three-way tie for fifth place at 13-13 overall and 6-6 in conference.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s still a little hurt from that Riverside game,” Watkins said. “That’s one we should’ve came away with fairly easily, but we have four games left. We have to get all of them. Each one counts more now than ever because we want to get into the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/","id":544,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[543,542,541],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"For Love of the Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-basketball-32-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-basketball-32-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Clair Watkins is Getting Her Game Back After Two ACL Tears Derailed Her Career","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One in 10 female NCAA athletes will tear their ACL.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has exactly 10 members.

The Charlotte, NC native was a top-notch recruit, coming off a 4A State Championship, a McDonald’s All-American nomination and was named North Carolina Female Athlete of the Year by the Charlotte Observer during her senior year.</p>\n<p>But at her first ever practice as a freshman, disaster struck.</p>\n<p>“It was the first day of practice and we were just running a full court drill,” Watkins said. “I looked over my shoulder to catch the ball, and I just landed completely straight legged at a really weird angle.”</p>\n<p>Done for the year. Just like that. Watkins had torn her right ACL.</p>\n<p>The injury was in typical fashion for an athlete — a noncontact play where a sudden deceleration or landing maneuver put the leg in a vulnerable position. While ACL injuries most often occur in team sports, 80 percent involve little or no contact with another athlete.</p>\n<p>Watkins redshirted that year and returned to the court as a sophomore, where she made her college debut. As a redshirt freshman, Watkins began to find her stride on the court. Early in the season, she tallied three blocks against University of South Carolina Upstate and four steals against Florida, both of which remain career-highs today.</p>\n<p>Against Sam Houston State in late November, Watkins recorded a career-high 12 points on 6-10 shooting and in early December, she posted a career-high at the time of eight rebounds versus Denver.</p>\n<p>“It was tough, because I was technically a freshman,” Watkins said. “I had a year sitting out, so I was really rusty. I love the team there and it was fun being part of the program, but basketball-wise it was rough because I was still getting my feet back under me. I had to keep up with fast-pace SEC basketball.”</p>\n<p>During her redshirt sophomore year, however, Watkins’ was dealt another tough blow. Leading up to the Tennessee game on Jan. 24, Watkins was at practice and was hit on the side of the knee setting a screen.</p>\n<p>The result was another ACL tear. This time it was the left one, leaving Watkins sidelined the remainder of the season once again.</p>\n<p>“At that point, I’m like, ‘Wait, what is going on? This can’t be happening,’” Watkins said. “It was so surreal. I don’t think I even cried. I cried over the first one a bit because I was disappointed, but the second one, I didn’t even cry because I was like, ‘man, alright, just going to do rehab again’ and it was second-nature to me.”</p>\n<p>Sitting out with her second ACL tear in two years, Watkins realized that the old saying that everything happens for a reason might have some truth to it.</p>\n<p>“The second [ACL tear] was actually a blessing in disguise, because I realized that my time at Vandy was over and that I did what I needed to do there,” Watkins said. “I sat back and thought about my options and realized I wanted to go somewhere else and have a new experience. Oddly enough, if I hadn’t hurt this knee, I don’t think I’d be here right now.”</p>\n<p>Now, Watkins is here at UCSB, but not as an undergrad. She currently studies at the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education, working towards her Master’s in Education.</p>\n<p>Simply because she’s not an undergrad doesn’t mean Watkins’ basketball career is over though. After rehabbing and twice surviving the injury known as “the commonest cause of the ex-athlete,” Watkins is back on the court and playing for the Gauchos with her two remaining years of NCAA eligibility.</p>\n<p>“She’s a lot like [center Kirsten Tilleman from last year] in that they love the game so much that they want to have a positive experience through it,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “With Clair, she wants to have fun again. It’s hard for her to even remember the high school days where that’s where her enjoyment of the game was. Her mom told me when she was here that that was the first time she’d seen [Clair] smile on the floor in a couple years. That means a lot.”</p>\n<p>Not on the roster to start the season, Watkins was taking extension classes during fall quarter. After she was admitted into the university, Watkins was cleared immediately by the NCAA to play.</p>\n<p>Joining the team midseason in late December put Watson at a fairly sizable disadvantage: a new style, new teammates and the expectation of serving as the team’s inside presence. At 6’4’’, Watkins brought height to a guard-driven team lacking in size and experience in the paint.</p>\n<p>“I definitely learned something from each [knee injury]. I’m definitely more appreciative when I do get to play,” Watkins said. “[Being back on the court] is a lot of fun. It’s a lot different than at Vanderbilt with different coaching styles, but I love it. And I get to walk to practice between palm trees with mountain[s] on one side and ocean on the other. It’s paradise out here.”</p>\n<p>So far, in her 15 games for Santa Barbara, Watkins has averaged 5.1 points and 5.5 rebounds, which is second on the team. She also averages 0.9 steals and leads the team with 1.0 block per game.</p>\n<p>While the statistics don’t show a player ready to dominate the Big West, Mitchell knows Watkins needs time, not only to adjust to UCSB’s ways, but find her game again after not being on the court in nearly a year due to the ACL injury.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the game happens really fast when you haven’t played for a long time. There’s nothing you can do to emulate that playing time on the floor,” Mitchell said. “But there’s no pressure; she needs to have fun and finish her career like she deserves to. I still think Clair will leave here being one of the best players in the Big West. Just like Sweets [Underwood] did, she could easily average a double-double every night.”</p>\n<p>A glimpse of the Watkins that caught so many recruiters’ eyes as a freshman was on display this past weekend. While any basketball fan could see Watkins had the skill, it’d yet to show up in the box score.</p>\n<p>Saturday at Cal State Fullerton, Watkins shined, earning the first double-double of her career. She scored 10 points and grabbed a career-high 15 rebounds, giving UCSB the presence inside it’d been missing all year long.</p>\n<p>“When basketball has been tough for her the way it has for her the last two years, it’s easy for her to get down on herself,” Mitchell said. “We’ve worked really hard on keeping her confident and reminding her every day that she could dominate in this conference. She’s an amazing talent, and we have to make sure she continues to work on her game and consistently gives us those numbers every night because there’s no reason she can’t.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of Feb. 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/for-love-of-the-game/","id":542,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[541,540,539],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Defending Champs UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-PLEASE-CROP-TO-SUPER-VERTICAL-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-PLEASE-CROP-TO-SUPER-VERTICAL-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos beat UCLA 6-4 on the road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be a month away from conference season, but the UCSB baseball team sent a major statement to the Big West last night, defeating defending champion UCLA on the road 6-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 4-1 on the season with the win, with three of the victories coming away from home.

This game was won in the circle with stellar performances from both sophomore pitcher Alex Pingree and senior pitcher Andriana Collins. Collins started the game and pitched four innings, only giving up one run in the process on a wild pitch. Pingree would then come into relief to pick up her first save for the team, recording four strikeouts in her two innings of play.</p>\n<p>The team’s next matchup was the first of a back-to-back with the University of Northern Iowa, which owned a record of 7-4. Santa Barbara put on a defensive clinic by once again only allowing one run in this 15-1 victory. Junior Shelby Wisdom would pick up the win and improve her ERA to 1.97.</p>\n<p>Along with great defense, the Gauchos performed incredibly on offense with a 10-run seventh inning. Freshman outfielder Kristen Clark continued to show her young talent as she led the way with three hits and three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had another strong defensive outing in their rematch with UNI on Saturday morning. They would again beat Northern Iowa, but this time it was no easy win, taking eight innings to put away the Panthers.</p>\n<p>Pingree was the starter and the finisher in the game, earning her third win while allowing only two runs in eight innings. Santa Barbara found itself down 2-0 in the bottom of the seventh inning, but was able to capitalize in clutch time by evening the score with a double from freshman infielder Emily Brucelas. Then in the eighth inning, senior infielder Kathryn Pilpil would seal the deal with a walk-off single into left scoring the runner from third.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara headed into its fourth game with a tournament record of 3-0, ready to take on No. 10 Florida State, the tournament’s host. The Gauchos dropped this matchup 5-2 as the Seminoles improved their record to 13-1. This was Florida State’s 13th straight win with the help of pitcher Lacey Waldrop, who carries a microscopic ERA of .50. Waldrop picked up her seventh win as she handled the Santa Barbara offense.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be the Louisville Slugger Invitational, which begins Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna  Kodelashvili of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54157\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54157\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/","id":1036,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1035,1034,1033],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Opening Weekend of Big West Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Tennis-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Tennis-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos fall to No. 44 UC Irvine before defeating Fullerton","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Conference play opened this past Saturday and Sunday for the UCSB women’s tennis team as it looked to pull out the upset over strong Big West contender and No. 44 UC Irvine, but fell to the Anteaters 6-1.

Boyer dropped the first set quickly, but battled back to win the second set. Gong simply overpowered Boyer in the third set and closed the match with a final score of 6-1, 4-6, 6-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came close to a second victory in the fifth singles match, which featured junior Stacy Yam and Irvine junior Kat Facey. The match resulted in a third set tiebreak in which Facey prevailed over Yam 6-1, 5-7, 10-6.</p>\n<p>The afternoon clearly spelt out a theme of domination on Irvine’s end. This is one of the Big West’s fiercest opponents and the Gauchos were aware of this coming into the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then headed north to face Cal State Fullerton on Sunday where they arose with a win in a 4-3 decision. With the win, the Gauchos improved to 1-1 in conference play while Fullerton dropped to 2-7 overall with a winless 0-4 record in conference play.</p>\n<p>This was a hard sought after win for the Gauchos, who split the six singles matches 3-3. The match came down to doubles play where the UCSB duo Boyer/Luisa Ortiz Candido defeated Fullerton’s Kalika Slevcove/Alexis Valenzuela in an eight-game pro set 8-4 and led UCSB to their first win in five matches.</p>\n<p>This win may act as a booster for Santa Barbara, which had dealt with many hardships this season in terms of injury and dominant opponents. With conference just getting under way, this win at Fullerton may act as the spark the Gauchos need to push themselves into the win column.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to San Jose State this Saturday, March 1 for their next match. Play is set to begin at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, Hecht had his usual stuff on display against the Spartans.</p>\n<p>Hecht did not allow an earned run through six innings of work and walked only two batters with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the offense for the Gauchos was clicking from the beginning of the first inning. Sophomore designated hitter Robby Nesovic brought in two runs home on a hit and then scored on a single by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, giving the Gauchos a 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Behind the arm of Hecht, UCSB tacked on to the lead in the second inning with one run, and an additional three more runs in the fourth inning. Santa Barbara added three more runs later in the game and won the contest 10-1.</p>\n<p>Nesovic went 3-5 from the plate with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s afternoon game was a close affair until the seventh inning, when SJSU broke a 3-3 deadlock. Sophomore pitcher Hector Lujan gave up a hit and walk before being pulled out from the game.</p>\n<p>The Spartans loaded the bases after another walk allowed, putting catcher Kyle Gallegos at the plate. Gallegos hit a clutch double, giving San Jose a two-run lead going into the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara responded with two runs to even the match. However, UCSB put itself into a further hole in the bottom half of the inning when they allowed two more runs giving San Jose a 7-5 advantage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara could not come up with the needed runs in the final and dropped the decision.</p>\n<p>Despite getting 16 hits in the game, UCSB couldn’t get the timely hits it needed to pull ahead. Junior right fielder Scott Quilan had the best performance from the plate, going 3-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Justin Jacome took the mound for the Gauchos in the opening game of the series. The lefty threw six solid innings, giving up two earned runs, two walks and four strikeouts before being lifted.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara got on the board in the second inning on a single by freshman outfielder Andrew Calica, who brought a runner home from third base. San Jose scored in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game at one apiece.</p>\n<p>Held scoreless for the next five innings, the Gauchos put a runner in scoring position with two outs, trailing by one run. Kuresa delivered the game-tying single UCSB needed that sent the game into extra innings.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless ninth inning pitched by sophomore Greg Mahle, the Gauchos started the tenth inning with a runner on second base after a walk and sacrifice.

However, once again, they were unable to come away with a victory.</p>\n<p>Cal got out to a quick start, shutting out the Gauchos for the entire first half until freshman attacker Brenna Thomas put UCSB on the board at the second-quarter buzzer. The Bears put in three goals in each of the first two quarters, heading into the half with a 6-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>The third period was the Gaucho’s best offensively in the game, with sophomore utility Samantha Murphy scoring to open the half. Unable to stop the prolific Cal offense, though, UCSB conceded three goals for the third-straight quarter.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Carly Christian came up with UCSB’s lone goal in the fourth quarter and the Gauchos fell with a final score of 10-4.</p>\n<p>In the next game against UC Davis, Santa Barbara came out ready to play. Murphy scored an early goal to give UCSB an early lead, followed by a goal from sophomore utility Jessie Porter to give the Gauchos a 2-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Aggies answered back with a goal of their own, but Thomas put away her second buzzer beater of the day to give her team a 3-1 lead heading into the second period.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Megan Linder and Porter each scored a goal of their own in the second, but Davis scored three before halftime to make it 5-4.</p>\n<p>In the second half, it was the Jessie Porter show. The sophomore put away a penalty to open the scoring for her team in the second half before scoring four more goals, answering every push the Aggies made.</p>\n<p>With just a narrow 10-9 lead, freshman attacker Jenna Solberg scored to make it 11-9 and seal a UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>Porter led the way with a season-high seven goals. Sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw finished the game with four saves.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road this weekend when they play in the Cal Lutheran Invite.

The Gauchos lost the doubles point again, with losses from doubles pairs junior Ziad Sultan and senior Sasha Gryaznov as well as junior Tobias Galskov and junior Miles Seemann. The third doubles pair made up of freshmen Teague Hamilton and Erik Johnsson put in a great effort as the pair was tied 7-7 with USC’s freshmen Nick Crystal and Rob Bellamy before they ended their match as the other two double match losses decided the doubles point in favor of the Trojans.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did not fare any better in singles against the Trojans, as all six matches went to USC with the Gauchos not winning a single set.

Yet Galskov/Seemann won their doubles match 8-3 over senior Sam MacNeil and freshman Alexandros Georgios.</p>\n<p>This marked the sixth match in a row the Gauchos lost the double point and it ultimately coming back to haunt them in the 4-3 loss. The team will certainly look to improve with conference matches in the very near future.</p>\n<p>In singles, Hamilton defeated freshman John Darmstaedter 6-3, 6-0 in the fifth position, giving the Gauchos their first victory. Finishing next were Gryaznov and Sultan’s matches in quick succession with Gryaznov losing to freshman Erik Komati 7-5, 6-1 and Sultan losing to MacNeil 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>Galskov played a fantastic match in the number one position, his first time playing there this season. He lost the first set, but came back to win the next two, winning the match over junior Sai Kartik Nakireddi 4-6, 6-2, 7-6. Galskov’s win gave the Gauchos a chance for victory with two matches remaining in the overall battle as the team was already down 3-1.</p>\n<p>“I thought we wasted a heroic performance from Tobias,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “Coming back from 5-4 down in the third [set] against a quality guy at No. 1, that was a hell of a battle. It was physical and I felt [Tobias] did most of the work. I’m really proud of Toby’s effort.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then looked to Seemann and Johnsson, needing both players to win their individual matches. Seemann looked to have his match against freshman Ethan Lopez wrapped up after winning the first set 6-4 and leading in the second set 4-0 while Johnsson had lost the first set 6-2 to sophomore Nikolas Papic yet was battling in the second. With both teams’ players looking on, Johnsson had a 5-4 lead over Papic, but could not finish the set with Papic coming back to win it 7-5 and leading the Bulldogs to victory while Seemann won his match 6-4, 6-1 as merely a consolation prize.</p>\n<p>“Teague played his best match of his Gaucho career so far,” Davis said. “Miles had a nice debut, so kudos to those guys but, I’m hugely disappointed overall. We just aren’t accustomed to losing at home and we’ve done it twice already this season, so I’m not too happy with things overall, but we did have a couple good performances today.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will move on from this weekend looking to more possible lineup changes with the move of Galskov to No. 1 working as he won on Sunday. The team hosts Nevada State on Friday and Pacific on Sunday, looking to change its losing ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/","id":725,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[724,723,722],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Rebounds Against CSUF on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos defeat Fullerton 64-54","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lack of consistency has been the UCSB women’s basketball team’s weakness all season long.</p>\n<p>Falling victim to coming out slow in both halves has resulted in a poor conference season for the Gauchos.

We had a lot of collapses late in the game, but [the key was us mixing] it up tonight,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think a lot of teams are nervous to play Fullerton because they can shoot it so well. By extending our zone, it was causing some issues [for them].”</p>\n<p>Plus, on a guard-driven team, UCSB finally found its post presence inside. At 6’4’’, Watkins headed the Gauchos’ zone defense and her height helped hold Fullerton from downtown. Then on offense, she earned the first double-double of her career with 10 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“That’s the personality and identity we’ve been looking for,” Mitchell said. “We had an inside presence (tonight) and it makes a world of difference when you can get double figures from an inside post player. That, by far, was the biggest difference in what we did tonight over any of our previous [25] games.”</p>\n<p>With the win, Santa Barbara improves to 8-17 overall and 3-9 in the Big West, keeping its playoff hopes alive with four games remaining on the season. Fullerton drops to 6-6 in conference and 10-15 overall.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began the game with energy, going on a 9-0 run, which UCSB held onto to take a 28-22 lead going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms, UCSB continued to increase its lead, extending the margin to 19 points with just under four minutes remaining. While Fullerton made a push in the final minutes, the large lead would be enough to keep the Titans at bay.</p>\n<p>“We were excited at halftime and happy about the way we were playing. We looked at each other and said, ‘They came back last time. We don’t want it to happen again,’” Watkins said. “There was a will to win because we just didn’t want a repeat of last time. The last couple minutes, I think everyone had a slight heart attack on the bench, but we were able to pull it out.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB shot 49.1 percent from the field compared to 33.9 percent for Fullerton. The Gauchos also outscored the Titans 32-22 in the paint.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos gave up a game-high 29 points to Titan senior guard Alex Thomas, Santa Barbara featured three players in double figures. While senior guard Nicole Nesbit led the team with 19 points and six rebounds on 8-16 shooting, it was a career night for senior guard Melissa Zornig, who reached the 1,000-point mark with her first basket of the game. Zornig finished the night with 18 points and four assists.</p>\n<p>“[She brings] so much consistency and leadership. She’s a very selfless player and it’s encouraging to coach someone who will do anything for the team to win,” Mitchell said. “She wasn’t worried about the thousandth point, but it’s nice for her to be able to have that for her scrapbook someday and to be able to sit down with the grandkids and let people know that back in the day that she was a scorer.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home next weekend for its final road series of the regular reason, facing UC Irvine Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/","id":543,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[542,541,540],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Moves Into Tie for First in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=921%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos defeat Fullerton 80-65","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off of a close win over UC Riverside Thursday, the UCSB men’s basketball team needed a win over Cal State Fullerton Saturday to move into first place in the Big West.

Harmon knocked down a pair of threes and matched Fullerton’s entire team with 10 points just eight minutes into the game.</p>\n<p>“Anytime we can get a win like that in a fashion where everybody’s playing well, hustling and executing, it’s always a great feeling,” Harmon said.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos extended their lead to 27-10, it was smooth sailing. The Titans went on a run to cut the deficit to 32-21, but with less than 30 seconds left in the half, Harmon found sophomore forward Taran Brown for a two-hand facial dunk, sending UCSB to the half with the momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s always exciting to get a dunk because you get the crowd into it and you get your teammates all going crazy on the bench,” junior center Alan Williams said. “It’s an opportunity to increase your level of energy and it’s on [your teammates] to match that.”</p>\n<p>As he has all year, Williams dominated both offensively and defensively. From the opening minutes, the big man played with an extra bounce in his step, making it look easy on his way to a 22-point, 18-rebound double-double on 8-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Titans fought back for the entire second half, led by guard Michael Williams. The senior single-handedly kept his team in the game, scoring a game-high 29 points and knocking down 5-10 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos always found an answer, however. Big Al gobbled up every rebound he could reach in the second half, and a one-hand highlight dunk off a loose ball pushed UCSB’s lead back up to 46-29 with just under 13 minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>With just four minutes to go, a three-pointer by Michael Williams cut the Gauchos’ lead to 63-54. The next time down the court, Bryson answered with another UCSB dunk, pushing the lead back up to 11 and dismantling any hope of a Titan comeback. Santa Barbara closed out the final minutes by knocking down free throws on their way to an 80-65 win.</p>\n<p>“It got a little closer [in the second half] but it was nice not to have to fight until the bitter end,” Bryson said. “We’re on a good track right now.”</p>\n<p>Harmon ended the night with 20 points and 10 assists while committing zero turnovers. In his last nine games, he has accumulated 49 assists and just three turnovers.</p>\n<p>“There’s no way we’ve had a player go through a stretch like this since I’ve been here,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He’s been amazing and has just gotten better and more confident as the season’s gone on.
