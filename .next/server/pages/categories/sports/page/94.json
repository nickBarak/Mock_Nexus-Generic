Prior to its last two victories, Santa Barbara had been on an 11-match losing streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look to end their latest slump against two familiar conference opponents, facing Cal State Fullerton in a primetime ESPN3 matchup on Friday and UC Riverside on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“It already gives our team some confidence going into the weekend because they can fall back on the success they had against them [CSUF &amp; UCR] the last time,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “But at the same time, we have to appreciate that the teams have gotten better and improved over the season. We need to be ready for a stronger opponent especially playing in their home gyms.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_66360\" style=\"width: 501px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"346483776\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66359\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66360\" data-attachment-id=\"66360\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/jaylen-villanueva-dives-for-a-short-ball-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Jaylen Villanueva dives for a short ball.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB looks to improve its 6-17 overall, 2-10 conference record. Despite earning victories over the Titans and Highlanders in previous meetings earlier this season, the Gauchos have struggled when playing on the road and are 1-6 in away matches.</p>\n<p>The troubles for Fullerton continue to pile up as it remains winless this season. CSUF is 0-24 overall and 0-12 in conference play. Dating back to the end of last season, the Titans are now on a 27-match losing streak.</p>\n<p>Still performing at a high level for the Titans is junior outside hitter Paige Reed. Overall, she ranks fifth in the Big West in digs per set with a 3.95 average. Since the start of conference play, she has moved up to fourth place, averaging 4.26 digs per set. She leads Fullerton in digs with 179.</p>\n<p>With regard to teams getting better, the gradual improvements throughout UCR’s season have resulted in some historical highlights for the Highlanders, who are 9-16 overall and 4-8 in conference matches. For just the fifth time in program history, Riverside won back-to-back Big West matches with their five set victory over Cal State Northridge and sweep of CSUF last weekend. Its nine overall wins is its most since 2005.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the sweep of Northridge handed UCR its fourth conference win of the season, tying its program record for Big West wins.</p>\n<p>Despite earning the 3-1 victory, Santa Barbara’s offense seemed to be a little disheveled by the Highlanders’ defense, having finished the match with a .152 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>“We need consistency,” Lantagne Welch said. “A lot of that stems from our serve-receive and our passing. Riverside is a really good defensive team. We’ll be more ready for that this time. If we’re passing the ball well, we’re going to have opportunities to score.”</p>\n<p>Improvements on the defensive end will be important for UCSB as well in hopes of containing the Highlanders’ senior outside hitter Helena Peric.</p>\n<p>She recently earned Big West Offensive Player of the Week honors after a phenomenal performance against CSUN. She tallied a career-high 23 kills and had 12 digs for her second double-double of the season to go along with a .308 hitting percentage. She continued her dominance with 15 kills, six digs, two service aces and a .379 hitting clip against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ containment begins at the net, a component of their defense in which they have excelled.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s average of 2.10 blocks per set ranks third overall in the Big West. In three of its last four matches, UCSB has registered double-digit blocking totals. The centerpieces to the Gauchos’ denial at the net are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield.</p>\n<p>They both rank within the top 10 overall of the Big West rankings in blocks per set and total blocks. Sheffield holds the team lead in both statistical categories with 82 blocks and a 0.95 blocks per set average while Grunt is second with 78 blocks and a 0.91 average.</p>\n<p>While UCSB was unable to find much success offensively in its first match versus UCR, it did respond with a .302 hitting night against Cal State Fullerton the following night. The Gauchos’ confidence helped carry them to a strong attack but they must find that same determination when they are out of sync as well.</p>\n<p>“It comes and goes,” Lantagne Welch said. “When we’re doing well, we’re very confident. When we struggle, we lose it too quickly. That’s something about getting tougher in that scenario and knowing that teams are going to make big plays and we’re going to mess up some. That’s okay, it’s just we need to respond right away.”</p>\n<p>ESPN3 will nationally broadcast the match between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton this Friday, Nov. 13th at 4:30 p.m. The Gauchos will bring their weekend to a close at UC Riverside on Saturday, Nov. 14th at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Senior forward Matt Wiesenfarth played the hero in that game, scoring his fourth goal of the season on a breakaway in the 93rd minute.</p>\n<p>In UCSB and UC Davis’ two meetings this season, the Gauchos came away victorious thanks to three goals from sophomore holding midfielder Kevin Feucht, all of which came from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’ve gotten three goals from the spot means that we’re doing some damage in the box,” Selemani said. “Obviously you want to get goals in other fashions, but I think the fact that we’re getting goals is important and the fact we’re getting wins is all that matters right now.”</p>\n<p>In the two teams’ first meeting at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost a 1-0 lead after conceding a 74th minute goal to junior Steven Guzman. It was a trademark goal for Davis that was characteristic of the gameplan it has continued to utilize against UCSB, being scored by a defender following a scramble off a long throw into the box.</p>\n<p>“We have to have high pressure and keep them from scoring set piece goals because that’s where they’re most dangerous,” junior left back Ismaila Jome said. “Their two center backs have their most goals, so if we just keep them from getting any headers in the box and play as well as we have throughout the season we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>However, junior forward Nick DePuy was dragged down in the box just 50 seconds after the Aggies’ equalizer, leading to Feucht’s second penalty of the game and eventual game-winner.</p>\n<p>Davis brings to town a physical, sluggish style that serves as somewhat of a foil to UCSB’s more traditional approach of passing and making good runs into the box. The Gauchos ended the season with the eighth best offense in the nation, scoring 38 goals through 19 games.</p>\n<p>“They have two guys, [sophomore forward Evan Barrett and junior forward Dashiell MacNamara], who are pretty quick,” Selemani said. “We just need to make sure we take those guys down and we have a good chance to win again.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ offensive attack can be summed up by the fact that its top two goal scorers during the regular season were defenders in senior Lucas Mohageg and redshirt freshman Roy Boateng. They will be looking to keep the score low as they wait for their chance to pack the box and find a goal off a good ball in or a fortunate bounce.</p>\n<p>“We work on [clearing] every practice, but especially [this week],” Selemani said. “We had everybody setting up in [Davis’] formations and defended like we would tomorrow, so hopefully that works as well and we get the result.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have had great success during conference play in recent years, they have been unable to get it done when it matters most, going 0-3 over the past two postseasons. That will likely change this time around with an experienced core group that has grown together over the years.</p>\n<p>“Since I’ve been here this is the best team as far as talent-wise, just collectively,” Jome said. “We have a good mix of younger guys and older guys and we know how big of a struggle it is to get into the postseason and win games.”</p>\n<p>Under Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, who received a record fifth conference Coach of the Year Award, UCSB’s dominant record this season was reflected in its dominance of the Big West yearly awards.</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy earned his second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Year after scoring 15 goals through 19 games. To put that number in perspective, the four players who tied for second in goals in the conference had less than half of DePuy’s total with seven. Only one NCAA player, USC Upstate’s Gordon Wild (16), has scored more goals than him this year.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 DePuy has been unstoppable all season thanks to a combination of size, good feet, extremely accurate shooting, and an excellent supporting cast that has given him great service. All of these factors have helped catapult him to a nation-leading eight game-winning goals. His individual success has led to the team’s success ever since he switched from the midfield to forward midway through last season, proven by UCSB’s undefeated record of 16-0-4 in games he has scored in.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s aforementioned supporting cast includes Big West Freshman of the Year Geoffrey Acheampong, who scored four goals and led the Big West with 10 assists, good for sixth-best in the country. UCSB first-year players have now won the award in four consecutive seasons and six of the past seven.</p>\n<p>The former Cate School star received a Big West Honorable Mention alongside sophomore left back Randy Mendoza and freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Other players joining DePuy on the All-Big West First Team were Feucht, who was second on the team with five goals, junior midfielder Josue Espana, and senior defender Duncan Backus.</p>\n<p>Selemani rounds out the long list of Gauchos receiving accolades, being named All-Big West Second Team with four goals. He ranked third in the conference with 50 shots, putting a high amount of pressure on back lines all year to help free up space for his teammates.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will benefit from having 11 nights of rest since their last game against Davis on Halloween, thanks to their winning the No. 1 seed and a bye in the first round of the postseason. In that final regular season game against the Aggies, UCSB came away with a 1-0 victory after freshman forward Cody Gibson was taken down in the box, leading to another game-winning penalty by Feucht.</p>\n<p>The winner of Wednesday’s game will face the winner between Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. If the Gauchos win, they will be at home for the championship game as they look to win their first Big West title since 2010.</p>\n<p>“Tomorrow is the biggest test because we haven’t made it to the final in [four] years,” Jome said. “The biggest challenge would just be winning tomorrow, and after that, we have to take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s game begins at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/","id":1464,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1463,1462,1461],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Inability to Close Sets Leaves Gauchos Frustrated with Losses to UCI & UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Unable to overcome its struggles in tight sets, the UCSB women's volleyball team encountered a 3-1 loss to UC Irvine on Saturday and was swept by UC Davis on Friday.

We can make a change at this point, there’s no reason we can’t step it up.”</p>\n<p>From the match’s beginning, UC Irvine was able to establish its dominance on the offensive end. It opened the first set with a 6-1 lead, forcing a UCSB timeout. The Anteaters took an even more comfortable lead at 17-7, causing another Gauchos’ timeout.</p>\n<p>While UCSB and UCI would go on to exchange points, the Anteaters’ .379 hitting percentage proved to be too much for the Gauchos’ defense.</p>\n<p>After a dismal .000 hitting percentage in the first set, UCSB bounced back with its best attacking performance in the second set. The Gauchos tallied 16 kills to go along with a .316 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s commanding start helped it gain a 12-9 lead but a 5-0 Anteaters’ run led to UC Irvine taking a 14-12 lead. However, the Gauchos responded with a 6-0 run of their own.</p>\n<p>Sparking the Gauchos’ run was the outstanding serving of senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva. Her four consecutive service aces helped give UCSB its 18-14 lead. Villanueva finished with a team-high 11 kills and had 10 digs.</p>\n<p>Adding to Villanueva’s match-high of four aces was Grunt and freshman outside hitter Devin Joos. Grunt led UCSB with a .389 hitting percentage and clocked four of her eight kills in the second set. In spite of her .156 hitting clip, Joos registered nine kills but was most valuable on defense with a match-high three solo blocks.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sustained its lead but not free of pressure from Irvine’s attempt to take the 2-0 lead. Able to force the 23-23 tie, a service error by sophomore setter Emily Blair and an attack error by redshirt senior outside hitter Marisa Bubica allowed the Gauchos to seal the set for the 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>The attacking error was certainly a mistake that Bubica did not forget entering the third set. Although both teams hit poorly in the set, Bubica had nine of her match-high 19 kills in the third set.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCI’s defense played more efficiently in the second half. In spite of being outblocked, Irvine’s 72 digs was its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>Twice did UCSB pull within a one-point deficit but could not capitalize on Irvine’s errors. Earning the Anteaters’ last two kills to take the 25-23 set victory and a 2-1 lead was redshirt sophomore opposite Lena Latour.</p>\n<p>It was a similar scenario in the final set as well. Trailing 6-5, UCSB found some separation with a 5-0 run to take a 10-6 lead and force a UCI timeout.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly after 18 kills the previous night against Cal Poly, freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha was not in the Anteaters’ starting lineup and did not enter the match until being used as a substitution in the fourth period.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s leader in kills with 307 and kills per set with a 3.34 average, Kekeauoha was perfect despite limited playing time. She finished with six kills on six attempts.</p>\n<p>Irvine trimmed UCSB’s lead and as the match progressed, took a 17-16 lead. Back and forth scoring occurred between both teams, but it seemed like the Gauchos were on their way to victory with a 22-20 lead. But a service error by Villanueva trimmed UCSB’s lead to one and provided UCI with its comeback opportunity. Irvine closed the match with a 5-2 run to earn its 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s troubles on offense stemmed from its .154 hitting clip the night before versus UC Davis. While Santa Barbara contained UC Davis’ senior outside hitter Kaylin Squyres to five kills and a .103 hitting clip in the first meeting, the Gauchos were unsuccessful in their attempt of a repeat performance on Friday.</p>\n<p>She finished with a match-high 13 kills, 14 digs, and a .379 attacking percentage. Junior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht finished with 10 kills and a .310 hitting average.</p>\n<p>Villanueva led UCSB with 10 kills but was the only Gaucho in double digit figures. It was her third consecutive match with double digit kills but was not enough to prevent the Gauchos from being swept.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road next Friday, Nov. 13<sup>th</sup> at Cal State Fullerton for a primetime matchup on ESPN3 at 4:30 p.m. The Gauchos’ weekend continues with a Saturday match at UC Riverside at 7:30 p.m. Santa Barbara’s two conference wins appeared in home matches against both teams earlier this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66268\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66268\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/","id":5081,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5080,5079,5078],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Burkenroad Hat Trick Sinks Gauchos in First Round of Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_3-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Despite taking a 2-1 lead into halftime, UCSB faltered as it couldn't find a way to keep Fullerton off the board in the second half.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66251\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_3-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"411379209\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66272\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66251\" data-attachment-id=\"66251\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/no-6-ucsb-falls-to-no-1-ucla-defeats-no-16-ucsb-in-ot/jessica-clegg-pushes-the-ball-forward-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_3-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Jessica Clegg pushes the ball forward.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>In a playoff rematch featuring two of the top squads in the Big West, the UCSB women’s soccer team fell short of its championship hopes in a 4-2-road loss to Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Three goals from senior midfielder Christina Burkenroad were the deciding factor in the Titans victory. The San Diego native scored in the 10<sup>th</sup>, 47<sup>th</sup>, and 63<sup>rd</sup> minutes, registering her first career hat trick and giving Fullerton its 15<sup>th</sup> win of the season.</p>\n<p>Participating in their first Big West Tournament since 2009, the Gauchos finish the year with an overall record of 13-6-1 and a conference record of 6-3. This is UCSB’s first ten-win season since 2008. The Titans improve to 15-3-1 overall and 7-3 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Fullerton came out swinging in the first half with Burkenroad’s goal the 11<sup>th</sup> minute. Senior forward Rebecca Wilson led Burkenroad down the field resulting in a chip shot past senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter, giving her team the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly responded by scoring a goal in the 18<sup>th</sup> minute off a breakaway from sophomore forward Amanda Ball. Ball split her defenders and scored on an unassisted goal launching a shot into the back left of the net.</p>\n<p>The Chino Hills forward netted three goals in her final three games, the first being a game-winner in the Gauchos’ 1-0 victory over Fullerton last Tuesday. Ball has recorded all of her five goals on the year after missing eight games due to injury.</p>\n<p>Following Ball’s score the freshmen duo of Sydney Magnin and Maddie Gibson connected on a goal of their own. Magnin put Gibson in scoring position off a line drive touch pass. Making her way down the field, Gibson snuck the ball past Big West Keeper of the Year Jennifer Stuart into the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The All-Big West Freshman broke the 1-1 bind and secured her team a 2-1 lead heading into the halftime break. Magnin and Gibson have been key assets to this young UCSB team recording six of the freshman’s 22 goals and 13 points for the year.</p>\n<p>Opening up the second period it was the play of Burkenroad and Wilson that kept things in favor for the Titans. The senior veterans took control of the half with a goal from Burkenroad in the 47<sup>th</sup> and 63<sup>rd</sup> minute.</p>\n<p>Big West Offensive Player of the Year Rebecca Wilson tallied in her second and third assists on the night setting up Burkenroad yet again for two easy scores and the 3-2 advantage.</p>\n<p>With momentum on their side, the Titans sealed the deal off an insurance kick from midfielder Connie Caliz. The redshirt sophomore made her moment in front of goal count, registering her third goal of the season. Fullerton preserved their comfortable lead after that point keeping its playoff hopes alive with a 4-2 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite a high-charged attack from Fullerton, Santa Barbara had an efficient outing on offense as well. The Gauchos outshot the Titans 12-10 in shots on goal and 3-1 in corner kicks. While UCSB had many chances in front of goal it was unable to capitalize.</p>\n<p>Despite an unfortunate end to the year, there is nowhere to go but up for this young team. The Gauchos have exceeded expectations for the season after being projected to finish sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As seniors Beth Ritter, Angelisa Cortez, and Savannah Francis end their collegiate careers at UCSB their roles will be handed down to their 19 underclassmen. Gaining valuable experience from a tough nonconference schedule, rigorous conference play, and this Big West Tournament, the Gauchos will look to build on their successful year next season.</p><div

from San Francisco State in its season-opening exhibition last night in the Thunderdome. Senior guards John Green and Michael Bryson both hit the 20-point mark as the Gauchos nearly doubled the Gators’ scoring totals in the final 20 minutes on their way to a 66-45 win.</p>\n<p>Green’s impressive stat line also included 12 rebounds and an efficient 9-14 shooting from the field. He was one of three starters to knock down a pair of three-pointers on the night, along with Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>After a slow start for UCSB, which trailed 4-0 several minutes into the game, a three-pointer from Vincent began a 14-0 run for the Gauchos as they took control of the lead for the remainder of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a layup by Green at the 6:35 mark gave Santa Barbara an 18-10 lead, the Gators responded well, going on an 11-4 run to cut the deficit to just one point. However, Green put away the final six points of the half for UCSB including a jumper with 17 seconds left to take a 28-25 lead into the break.</p>\n<p>The first half was a relatively sluggish one for the Gauchos, but they were able to turn that around in the second.

Bryson meanwhile had a solid overall game, shooting 8-17 from the field and picking up six boards, two assists, a steal and a block.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for San Francisco State was forward Floyd Wormley. The senior shot 4-12 from the field to end the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists, all team-highs. As a team, the Gators finished an inefficient 15-59 (25.4 percent) from the field, compared to 25-57 (43.9 percent) for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard T.J. Taylor didn’t score, but was able to impact the game in other ways as he tied Vincent with five assists for the team-lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face the University of Nebraska-Omaha in its regular season opener this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/","id":394,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[393,392,391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Promising Start for Henrickson & UCSB, Nearly Force OT in 70-67 Exhibition Loss vs CSUDH","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Despite its 70-67 exhibition loss to Cal State Dominguez Hills on Sunday, the UCSB women's basketball team is headed in a progressive direction with new Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson guiding the team.

We did that too much and were kind of sloppy, we just have to be more discipline and fundamental.”</p>\n<p>The Toros were small in the paint and UCSB made sure it dominated. At six feet two inches, Jones capitalized on CSUDH’s lack of size in the front court, posting-up and backing down defenders for quick turnaround layups.</p>\n<p>In order to improve its interior defense, Dominguez Hills switched between a full-court press and 2-3 zone. While Jones periodically scored some baskets down low, the Toros’ defensive adjustment was beneficial. It forced UCSB to shoot from the perimeter, an unsuccessful aspect of the Gauchos’ shot selection. Santa Barbara shot 25 percent from long distance, going 4-of-16 from behind the three.</p>\n<p>“It pushed us out wide,” Henrickson said. “We needed to be able to go downhill and instead of playing it East-West, our zone offense needed to go North-South. It was a zone, but their [Dominguez Hills] ball pressure felt like man.”</p>\n<p>Eventually the “small ball” lineup of Dominguez Hills prevailed, outscoring UCSB 20-12 in the third quarter. With 2:09 left in the period, CSUDH went on an 8-2 run to take a 56-49 lead to head into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Knocking down one of the two three-point field goals during the Toros’ run was senior guard Breanna Garcia. The score was the stimulus to her four consecutive baskets in the fourth quarter’s opening. Her scoring rally helped CSUDH take a 10-point, 65-55 lead with 06:12 left in regulation. Garcia ended with a game-high 24 points on a 10-of-16 shooting afternoon.</p>\n<p>With 4:58 remaining in the fourth quarter, junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe drained a clutch three-pointer to establish the Gauchos’ comeback surge. She registered six points while finishing with a game-high of nine assists, tying her career-high.</p>\n<p>A jumpshot by freshman guard CoCo Miller continued Santa Barbara’s come-from-behind attempt. Despite picking up three early fouls, limiting her to 19 minutes, Miller shot four-of-five for 12 points. The scores helped spark UCSB’s 10-2 run, trimming CSUDH’s lead to 65-67.</p>\n<p>A missed three-point attempt by Toros’ junior guard Imari Brown set UCSB up with its last attempt at either a win or tie.</p>\n<p>As UCSB looked for Jones in the paint for the game-tying bucket, the Toros’ defense forced senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware to settle for a missed three-pointer with 41 seconds left in the game.</p>\n<p>The missed attempt led to the Gauchos having to intentionally foul, sending Dominguez Hills to the free throw line. A missed free throw by Dominguez Hills’ redshirt junior guard Femi Hamilton kept UCSB within three, down 65-68.</p>\n<p>A timeout helped give Santa Barbara time to draw up a play that freed up Jones in the paint for an easy layup that cut the Toros’ lead to one at 68-67.</p>\n<p>Another UCSB foul placed senior guard Monay Lee at the free throw line as she made both to give Dominguez Hills a 70-67 lead. She finished with 16 points and two steals. The Toros sunk 69.2 percent of their free throws, making 18-of-26.</p>\n<p>With no timeouts and five seconds remaining, it left UCSB with no other option than to go for the game-tying three. Unable to find Jemerigbe, Ware or Miller for the last shot, junior forward Mi’Chael Wright ended up taking the three-point attempt that bounced off the cylinder of the rim and resulted in the Gauchos’ 70-67 loss.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s bench outscored its starting lineup, Henrickson knows that it is going to take more than scoring for the Gauchos to earn victories.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have favorites,” Henrickson said. “At the end of the day, it’s about production. Be a better screener, weak side help, spread the floor, defensive transition, be a better rebounder on both ends of the floor. Most people think it’s about scoring, it’s not. Think about all the ways you can win a game that require no talent. If we buy into that, it’ll just increase our chances to be successful.”</p>\n<p>In spite of falling short, the exhibition loss does not blemish the Gauchos’ overall record as they prepare for their season opener this Friday, Nov. 13<sup>th</sup> at Washington St. at 8:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/","id":395,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[394,393,392],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 6 UCSB Falls to No. 1 UCLA, Defeats No. 16 UCSD in OT","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"In their second to last weekend of the regular season, the Gauchos bounced back from a difficult matchup with the Bruins to pick up a win in a high scoring game with the Tritons.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66249\" style=\"width: 181px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"570752076\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66273\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66249\" data-attachment-id=\"66249\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/no-6-ucsb-falls-to-no-1-ucla-defeats-no-16-ucsb-in-ot/mens_wp_lmu_9-27_eric_swenson_003-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"8\",\"credit\":\"Eric Swenson\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Mitchell Hamilton pump fakes, successfully distracting the defense.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into the penultimate weekend of the regular season, the No. 6 UCSB Men’s water polo had two tough matches including one against No. 1 UCLA. Unfortunately the Gauchos lost to the Bruins 9-4, but were able to rebound and pick up a solid non-conference road win at No. 16 UC San Diego 16-14. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The equivalent win/loss record puts Santa Barbara at an admirable 15-9 record but the loss at UCLA drops it to 3-5 in MPSF play. After defeating UCSB, the Bruins also beat LBSU to help preserve their perfect 24-0 record including an 8-0 conference record. With the win UCLA has now locked up the No. 1 seed in the MPSF championships. The loss for the Tritons sets them back to an 11-13 record but still hold a respectable 4-2 WWPA record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing the Gauchos are respected for is their resiliency. In fact, the Gauchos haven’t lost back to back games in five weeks. They were able to keep this streak alive by pulling out a tough overtime win against UCSD after losing the night before at UCLA.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB came out of the gates firing, opening up a 3-1 lead midway through the first period thanks to senior two-meter Liam Gaughan and junior utility Reed Cotterill. However, right before the quarter came to a close, senior utility Chase Cockerill netted a goal to make the score 3-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high scoring continued in the second as the frame began with both teams trading goals before Santa Barbara went on a run and took a commanding 7-4 lead. But once again UCSD closed the quarter strong adding two goals in the final minute to only trail by one at halftime, 7-6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third period commenced with the Tritons scoring two goals to take their first lead of the game 8-7. The Gauchos responded by going on a 3-0 run with goals from junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton, Gaughan, and senior attacker Derek Shoemaker. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tritons’ own captain, Cockerill, added two goals to end that run and go into the final frame tied at 10. Both teams traded two goals in the fourth to make it 12-12 headed into the overtime period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OT began with Hamilton and Shoemaker scoring goals to open up a 14-12 lead but just before the first intermission the Tritons scored with 15 seconds left to cut the lead to one. However the Gauchos proved to be too much as they added two more goals in the second half of overtime and won 16-14.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoemaker had yet another impressive game scoring four goals on the night alongside fellow senior Liam who netted his own three. Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge also had another outstanding performance with 10 saves on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night prior to this impressive offensive output which is now UCSB’s season high for points in a single match, Santa Barbara was held to its lowest scoring total of the season at UCLA by only being able to muster up four goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB managed to start the game strong with good defense and went down 2-1 at the end of the first frame. However, in the second the Gauchos fell apart on both sides of the pool being outscored by UCLA 5-0 to start the quarter. Luckily Shoemaker netted a goal with just over a minute left to go down at half 7-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Santa Barbara was able to play good defense in the second half by again only allowing two goals, the offense was not able to get much of anything and was only able to equal the output of the Bruins. The game ended 9-4, with UCLA being not really threatened for most of the second half. Whitelegge did manage to finish with 11 saves however, another impressive total for the senior.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all this was another solid weekend for the Gauchos. They were able to show toughness by getting a tough win in a tough road game. And although the scoreboard might indicate a blowout, the fact remains that the Gauchos are still a tough contender in MPSF play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s final match of the regular season is Sunday, November 15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at Pepperdine at 12 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

This week, the two teams will go to battle against the Titans on Thursday in a rematch with much higher stakes: the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We now know why they are 6-2 in conference,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “[Fullerton] is very organized defensively and are dynamic in the attack which is something we have to look out for.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finished as the Tri-Big West Conference Regular Season Champions with Fullerton and Long Beach.

After pulling off the upset Thursday night against the Titans, the Matadors made sure to spoil Santa Barbara’s five-game winning streak with a 4-3 overtime win off a penalty kick from junior midfielder Kourtney Kutscher.</p>\n<p>Despite ending conference play on a bitter note, Head Coach Paul Stumpf believes the tough loss has helped prepare UCSB for its postseason matchup.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know the team’s characters are intact [from this loss], they will fight to the end and they can score three goals in eleven minutes if the conditions are right. There definitely were some good lessons to take from [this weekend],” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite a one-game skid, the Gauchos have finished their season strong, winning seven of their last nine matches. Helping guide his team to its third regular season title with an overall record of 13-5-1, Stumpf claimed his second Big West Coach of the Year Award.<br>\nStumpf’s coaching and ability to pull out late-game victories has paid dividends for the team as UCSB will see its first Big West Tournament appearance since 2009. Santa Barbara is 3-3-3 overall in the conference tournament, having its previous postseason match against Cal Poly end in a 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB is welcomed back to the tournament with the tough task of trying to contain the 2015-16 Big West Offensive Player of the year in Fullerton’s Rebecca Wilson. The redshirt senior forward has carried her team all season long, scoring 18 goals on the year, the most of any Big West player this season.</p>\n<p>Wilson led Fullerton past Cal Poly on the road last Sunday, recording both of the team’s goals in a 2-1 win. The senior has compiled 77 starts in her four years at CSFU, including five game-winning goals, tied for the sixth most in Titans’ history.</p>\n<p>In preparation of Fullerton’s high-powered offense, the Gauchos will depend on the forward duo of freshman Mallory Hromatko and sophomore Amanda Ball to lead their offensive attack. The two forwards were huge pieces in Santa Barbara’s match against Fullerton and CSUN. Hromatko assisted Ball on the game-winning goal against CSFU while Ball also scored the 3-3 equalizer to send UCSB into overtime against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>The two underclassmen have made their mark this year, combining for a total of 13 goals, eight assists and 36 points. The two landed Big West honors this past Tuesday with Hromatko being named to the First Team All-Big West and Ball to the Second Team.</p>\n<p>However, Hromatko and Ball have not been the only sources of production in the Gauchos’ success. Stumpf accredits his young group along with the leadership of upperclassmen’s supporting the team’s ability to compete at a high level.</p>\n<p>“[This team] has surprised us in how savvy they are tactically,” Stumpf said. “We can make an adjustment at half and with no practice time they are able to implement them into the game … I guess I have a little more confidence in this young team because they have just found ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The mixture of youth and experience has been a vital element in the Gauchos’ progression to the postseason. Along with Hromatko and Ball, six total players were selected to an All-Big West Team including freshman Jessica Parque, freshman Sydney Magnin, sophomore midfielder Chace Schornstein and junior defender Sydney Fuertes.</p>\n<p>“We owe a lot of our success to the older players because if they weren’t so welcoming to us freshmen, I don’t think our chemistry would be the same as it is right now,” Hromatko said. “It’s a group effort every time we step out on the field and the individual stats are not even a factor.”</p>\n<p>The keys to victory are simple for UCSB this Thursday: polish the team fundamentals they have been working on all season, and build from the positives of last week’s win against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we have to change [our] play at all against [Fullerton], we just have to continue what we have been doing,” Hromatko said. “We need to build off our play in the second half against them because we were able to connect more once we realized how their formations worked.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will open up its first Big West Tournament match at Titan Stadium Thursday night. Kickoff against Fullerton will commence at 7:30 p.m. While this is yet another challenge for this young team, they understand the importance of embracing the moment and not letting it slip away from them.</p>\n<p>“Our goal [this year] was to make it to the Big West Tournament,” Hromatko said. “So now it’s just about leaving everything you have out on the field because you never know when it could be our last game … we are going to come out strong Thursday and play for each other like we have been all season long.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/","id":1461,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1460,1459,1458],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fresh Start for Bonnie and the Gauchos","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-16-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"It was a busy offseason for the UCSB women's basketball program.

While its focus remains on its new beginnings as a team, it is expected that the chatter of the critics and naysayers will be a motivating factor for Santa Barbara.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite being in a reconstruction phase, UCSB’s return of 10 players preserves some familiarity on the court. At the forefront of the Gauchos’ lineup is junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She led UCSB with a team-high 8.6 points and 4.0 assists per game last season. Her assists per game average ranked sixth overall in the Big West, increasing to fourth-best in conference games with a 4.4 average.</p>\n<p>During the 2014-15 season, Jemerigbe recorded career-highs with 16 points against Cal State Bakersfield and nine assists against San Diego State. Most importantly, her efficiency when facilitating the ball resulted in her 1.3 assists/turnover ratio on the season.</p>\n<p>With Big West All-Freshman Team and Honorable Mention honors under her belt, it was no surprise that the floor general was named to the College Sports Madness All-Big West Preseason Second Team.</p>\n<p>While Sunday will be the first glimpse of the Gauchos in action, it will be the fourth game for Dominguez Hills this season after participating in the Disney Classic Tournament this past weekend. CSUDH is 1-2 overall after losing its first two games to Winona State and University of Alaska Anchorage, but earned its first victory with a 68-63 win over William Jewell College this past Sunday.</p>\n<p>Cal State Dominguez Hills is a NCAA Division II university that plays within the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). The Toros’ campaign continues after back-to-back CCAA Tournament Championships.</p>\n<p>They also finished as the CCAA regular season co-champions with Humboldt State, finishing with an overall record of 26-7 and 19-3 in conference games. A total of four players averaged double digit points per game throughout the Toros’ journey to their conference championship. Returning from the bunch are senior guards Breanne Garcia and Monay Lee.</p>\n<p>Both were named to the All-CCAA First Team last season and have been MVP’s of their team’s last two conference tournament championships, Lee in 2013 and Garcia in 2014, respectively. Additionally, Lee was named a Second-Team Daktronics All-Region Selection in 2013.</p>\n<p>Garcia was the Toros’ leading scorer last year, averaging 15.3 points per game which ranked fourth in the CCAA. So far this season, the trajectory of her play is headed in a similar direction as she leads the Toros with 16.3 points per game and is coming off a season-high 20 point performance, 16 of which she scored in the second half. Next in line for the team-high in scoring is Lee with 11 points per game. She averaged 6.8 rebounds per game last season and currently ranks second on the team in free throw percentage at 81.8 percent.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game versus CSUDH is UCSB’s only exhibition game before its season opener on Friday, Nov. 13. It will begin at 1 p.m. in the Thunderdome. It is intriguing as to how the Gauchos will fair in their first game as we all know the drastic difference between practice and in-game situations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66147\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/fresh-start-for-bonnie-and-the-gauchos-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66147\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/fresh-start-for-bonnie-and-the-gauchos-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/fresh-start-for-bonnie-and-the-gauchos-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/fresh-start-for-bonnie-and-the-gauchos-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/fresh-start-for-bonnie-and-the-gauchos-2/","id":426,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[425,424,423],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Set for First Tip Off in Post Big-Al Era","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-16-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team gears up for its first exhibition game this Sunday.

For the first time since 2012, UCSB will be starting the season without center Alan Williams and point guard Zalmico Harmon, who both graduated last year.</p>\n<p>In his two years with UCSB, Harmon was one of the conference’s most efficient point guards, leading the Big West with a 4.6 assist to turnover ratio in 2013-14 and ranking fourth in 2014-15 with a 2.2 ratio.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a short stint with the Houston Rockets in the NBA Summer League, Williams made the move to the Chinese Basketball Association to play for the Qingdao Double Star Eagles. He leaves behind huge shoes to fill after finishing as UCSB’s all-time leader in rebounds and second all-time leader in scoring.</p>\n<p>Even though they have to replace two key starters, the Gauchos received 161 points in the Big West Preseason Coaches’ Poll, predicting a second place finish behind only UC Irvine. After a 72-63 overtime win in the Big West Semifinals, the Anteaters went on to win the conference and earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Despite the lineup changes, UCSB will not be without strong leadership this season. Senior guard Michael Bryson was named to the Big West All-First Team after averaging 13.9 points per game in 2014-15, good for ninth best in the conference. His career point total of 1,043 is the most among active Big West players, helping make him the only Gaucho voted to the Big West Preseason All-Conference team.</p>\n<p>Alongside Bryson, senior guard John Green has overcome a series of injuries throughout his collegiate career to establish himself as one of the best players on the team. After missing all but four games from 2011-2014, Green played all 33 games in 2015 while averaging the third most points per game on the team at 11.3 on an impressive 47.7 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent will have an increased role in the backcourt with the absence of Harmon. In just his first year with the Gauchos, Vincent averaged 10.1 points and 2.1 assists per game while knocking down 57 three pointers, the second most by a freshman in program history.</p>\n<p>UCSB added a handful of freshmen in the offseason, including point guard Grant Troutt from Episcopal School of Dallas and forward Jarriese Blackmon.</p>\n<p>Troutt averaged 12 points, five assists and two rebounds in his junior year and impressed scouts with his play in the AAU circuit to earn a spot with UCSB. He will join a crowded backcourt that already has several other point guards including junior Eric Childress and senior T.J. Taylor. Similar to last year, Head Coach Bob Williams may plan to use different combinations which utilize three or four point guards throughout the season.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Blackmon was Utah’s Player of the Year, leading his team to the state championship tournament with averages of 16.7 points, 10.7 rebounds and over two assists, blocks and steals per game. At 6’6”, 210 pounds, he is a combo forward that can make an impact early for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Finally, forward Ami Lakoju will have his chance to shine after missing the majority of last season. The redshirt freshman collapsed during practice last December and was shut down for the remainder of the year, but has made progress since then and should play a huge part for the Gauchos as they look to replace Williams, their top player from the last few seasons.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s season-opening exhibition against San Francisco State tips off this Sunday at 5:30 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66142\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66142\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/","id":384,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[383,382,381],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Driven by Desire to Upset Top Ranked Bruins, Travel to No. 16 UCSD After","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MWaPo-BenPu-IMG_9101-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MWaPo-BenPu-IMG_9101-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Only three games remain for the UCSB men's water polo team until the beginning of the MPSF Tournament on Friday, Nov. 20th.

Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The last time the two teams met was one year ago at Campus Pool. UCSB almost pulled off a miraculous comeback after being down 6-1 at halftime, but fell just short as UCLA won 10-7. The Bruins’ 25-game winning streak is their second longest in program history. They have also won 21-straight MPSF conference games dating back to 2013. With a victory Friday night, UCLA will lock up the first seed in the MPSF championships; therefore, the Gauchos can expect the utmost effort from the Bruins.</p>\n<p>“We are playing the No. 1 team in the nation,” Shoemaker said. “They’re probably the best team I’ve ever played. We are all super excited.”</p>\n<p>The No. 1 team is led by junior attacker Ryder Roberts, who is currently the team leader in goals with 39. The junior was also named MPSF player of the week for Oct. 5-11 after leading his team to a SoCal Invitational championship. Roberts has scored at least two goals in his last six matches. Sophomore attacker Max Irving is another player to watch out for as he is second on the team in goals with 31.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, junior goalkeeper Garrett Danner has played excellently for the Bruins, racking up 143 saves over the course of the season. Danner also received MPSF Player of the Week honors on Sept. 21. His great play has helped UCLA to outscore opponents 304-112.</p>\n<p>In order to pull off the upset, Santa Barbara will need big performances from Shoemaker who leads the team in scoring with 34 goals and senior two-meter Nick Jordan who leads the team with an impressive .435 shooting percentage. Sophomore Shane Hauschild will also be key as he has cracked 30 goals for the second-straight season.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos will look to count on junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton, who has a team-high 18 steals this season. In addition, UCSB has arguably one of the best goalkeepers in MPSF history in Chris Whitelegge. The senior has cracked the top five in MPSF all-time saves leaders with 826. Whitelegge’s 10.8 saves per game is top three in MPSF and his 0.59 save percentage is one of the best as well.</p>\n<p>“We just got to focus up on defense.” Whitelegge said. “They move a lot, they’re fast, they counter hard, we just gotta stay with them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next match is at UCSD Saturday night. Although its record may not be mind-boggling, UC San Diego is a solid team that UCSB cannot underestimate. The two teams last met about a month ago at the SoCal Invitational with Santa Barbara winning 12-8. In that match, Whitelegge recorded an amazing 16 saves.</p>\n<p>“They have a great home crowd,” Whitelegge said. “we look forward to taking it to them hopefully and getting a good win on the road.”</p>\n<p>The key player for the Tritons is senior utility Chase Cockerill. He currently leads UCSD in goals scored with 47 on the season, and he scored three goals in the team’s previous match against UCSB. Cockerill also leads the defense with 34 steals. Young redshirt freshman goalkeeper Jack Turner has obtained 153 saves on the season while junior driver Andy Moore has recorded 31 steals, second most on the team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have an amazing opportunity Friday as they play the No. 1 team in the nation. This team has shown time and time again they can beat quality opponents, but they have yet to do so. What better time to do it than two weeks before the MPSF championships? A win against UCLA won’t be easy, but it would definitely be a good sign that this UCSB team is ready to compete with the powerhouse programs that have run the conference since its inception.</p>\n<p>“Honestly we are extremely confident we can win,” Shoemaker said. “We just have to work hard and execute.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play at undefeated UCLA Friday, Nov. 6 at 7:00 p.m. UCSB will then make a quick trip to San Diego to play the Tritons on Saturday, Nov. 7 at 7:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

With just six matches left this season, it would take a miracle for the Gauchos to win out the remainder of their schedule to achieve a neutral finish. At 6-15 overall and 2-8 in conference play, the odds of Santa Barbara ending with an 8-8 Big West record are highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>“You aren’t necessarily pleased with the results, but you work on improving the program and improving everybody every day,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch explained. “It’s still the process that matters.

UC Davis enters the Thunderdome with an overall record of 11-14 and 6-5 in conference matches. Saturday will be the first time UCSB and UC Irvine face each other this season. The two teams split last year’s season series with Irvine winning the first match 3-2 and UCSB redeeming itself with a 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite limiting star senior outside hitter Kaylin Squyres to five kills and a .103 hitting clip in its first meeting against the Aggies, UCSB was unable to contain Davis’ offense, which hit over .300 in the match’s first two sets. Since the start of conference play, Davis ranks second in the Big West with 540 kills, 514 assists and 648 digs.</p>\n<p>Filling in for the absence of Squyres in that first meeting was junior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht. She was the only player to achieve double digit kills with 17. Walbrecht ranks second on the team with a total of 234 kills and a 2.52 kills per set average.</p>\n<p>Still, as the conference leader with 406 kills and a kills per set average of 4.37, containing Squyres is not a guaranteed outcome. Prior to the Aggies’ recent loss to Long Beach State this past Saturday, Squyres tied a 25-year-old school record with eight service aces in a five-set victory over Cal State Northridge on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“We just need to know that a lot of balls are going to go to the outside,” Lantagne Welch said. “We’ve got to be really clean with our defense through six rotations, not just three. We have to do a better job consistently throughout a match of defending the left side.”</p>\n<p>UCSB may have found a hidden gem of its own at the outside hitter position in freshman Devin Joos. In spite of the loss to Cal Poly, Joos made the most of her opportunity in receiving more playing time in the front row. It is expected that after career-highs of 12 kills and a .258 hitting percentage that she will be a frequent asset in the Gauchos’ offensive attack.</p>\n<p>“She’s been a regular in our starting group for a little while now,” Lantagne Welch said. “She had an emerging game, and we just need her to keep being productive and keep contributing to the team.”</p>\n<p>Topping off the Gauchos‘ weekend is their match versus UC Irvine. It is not too common that a team faces a conference opponent for the first time this late in the season, but UCSB is optimistic about its chances.</p>\n<p>“We have tape on them as they [UC Irvine] do on us,” Lantagne Welch explained. “It’s kind of exciting to have that new, refreshing team to get to go after and see how you match up with. They have some dynamic players, and it’ll be a good battle. There’s some things that we’re working on to take to the Anteaters.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of what Santa Barbara’s strategy is heading into game day, certainly it will include a plan to try to prevent freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha from dominating. She leads the Anteaters with 283 kills, a 3.29 kills per set average, 28 service aces and 168 digs. Kekauoha has recorded an ace in the Anteaters’ last five matches.</p>\n<p>The versatile freshman recently earned her second Big West Freshman of the Week award this past Monday. In the Anteaters’ last two contests, Kekauoha tallied a total of 35 kills and a .460 attacking percentage. Within this impressive feat was a career-high 20-kill performance in Irvine’s sweep of CSUN this past Saturday. In 17 of the team’s 23 matches, Kekauoha has registered double digit kills.</p>\n<p>Assisting the play of Kekauoha is redshirt junior Victoria Dennis, in her breakout year. Entering the 2015 season, Dennis had a career total of 133 kills, which includes redshirting her sophomore year. She has had no issue with embracing a bigger role, however, ranking second on the team in kills with 241 and kills per set at 3.01.</p>\n<p>The pattern of the breakout year continues with UCSB junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt. In four of the team’s last six matches she has earned double digit kills. Grunt ranks fourth overall in the Big West in hitting percentage with a .344 average and has made a significant improvement since the start of conference play with the second-best hitting clip at .402 percent. Grunt is currently third on the Gauchos’ roster in kills with 139 and second in total blocks with 74.</p>\n<p>“She’s putting up big numbers, so teams are putting more attention on her to slow her down,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need more balance on our team and other people to put the ball away. She’s been very consistent for us. We just need her to stay aggressive and stay after it.”</p>\n<p>This weekend’s contests are two of UCSB’s last three home matches of the season. Santa Barbara’s rematch versus UC Davis on Friday, Nov. 6 will begin at 7:00 p.m. Its matchup versus UC Irvine follows on Saturday, Nov. 7 at 7:00 p.m. Both matches will take place in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/","id":5077,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5076,5075,5074],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sneaks Past CSFU With 1-0 Victory, Come Up Short in Overtime at CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_6-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"After a critical 1-0 win over Cal State Fullerton on Thursday, it was an admirable comeback attempt by UCSB's women's soccer team in its 4-3 loss to Cal State Northridge.

Matching up against its biggest competition in hunt of the Big West title, Santa Barbara headed into Titan Stadium to face the top-ranked team in the conference in Cal State Fullerton. With both teams hosting a conference record of 5-1 in the Big West, this defensively charged match kept the two southern California squads scoreless for the first 77 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were deprived of offensive opportunities in the first half as they were held to two corner kicks and one shot on goal. Santa Barbara’s best chance at a goal came off a corner kick in the 37<sup>th</sup> minute by senior forward Savannah Francis.</p>\n<p>The fourth year from La Mirada, CA sent the ball high towards the middle of the goal box looking for her teammates but had her shot attempt snatched in mid-air by Fullerton’s redshirt junior goalkeeper Jennifer Stuart, which would be her only save of the day.</p>\n<p>The Titans controlled the majority of the match racking up nine of their total 15 shots in the first half. Redshirt senior forward Rebecca Wilson led the way accounting for seven shots on goal. Wilson has emerged as one of the conference’s elite scorers, knocking in a league best 16 goals on the year. The former Big West Player of the Year polled in six scores during the month of October, including a season-high three goals in the Titan’s 4-0 blowout over Hawaii October 11<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Heading into the second half, the score remained at a stalemate until an opportunity presented itself in the 77<sup>th</sup> minute for UCSB sophomore forward Amanda Ball. Freshman forward Mallory Hromatko found Ball down the right flank nearing the penalty box and delivered a touch pass to her teammate. With a defender right on her back, Ball made one inside cut past a diving Stuart and launched a go-ahead goal in to the bottom left of the net.</p>\n<p>Ball’s third goal since coming off of injury couldn’t have been at a better time as it handed her team the 1-0 victory. Her score helped end Stuart’s unbeaten streak of 11 games this year.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter played a pivotal role in Thursday’s contest, recording a season-high eight saves to shutout the Titan’s high-powered offense. Fullerton came into the match with 38 goals on the year, the most by any team in the conference.</p>\n<p>Since taking over for junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia in their match against Long Beach State, Ritter has been the anchor on defense for UCSB. She has won seven of her eight previous starts.</p>\n<p>While it chipped away at Cal State Northridge’s early lead in Sunday’s match, UCSB came up short in its season finale. After trailing 3-0 by the end of the first half, Head Coach Paul Stumpf and his team made some adjustments, influencing the Gauchos’ aggressive attack in the second period. Attempting to spoil the Matadors’ Senior Night, UCSB scored three goals in the 57<sup>th</sup>, 64<sup>th</sup>, and 68<sup>th</sup> minute to tie the game up 3-3 and send it into overtime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first score came off the foot of freshman midfielder Maddie Gibson. Gibson gave that offensive spark that the Gauchos were desperately searching for, lining up to the left of the goal box about 25 yards out and sending it in the back of the net. This was Gibson’s first score of her collegiate career, putting UCSB on the board with the score 1-3.</p>\n<p>The freshman midfielder was not done yet as Hromatko connected with Gibson in the 64<sup>th</sup> minute off a cross inside the box. Gibson was in the right place at the right time, redirecting a header past senior goalkeeper Cynthia Tafoya for the 2-3 score.</p>\n<p>With the Matadors on their heels and the momentum on UCSB’s side, Ball took matters into her own hands in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute running from about 15 yards out and launching a line drive past a diving Tafoya for the 3-3 equalizer.</p>\n<p>Sending the match into extra minutes, the Gauchos looked to be the favorites during the first moments of overtime but could not capitalize on their attacks. After three corner kicks and a shot on goal by Hromatko in the 91<sup>st</sup> minute, the match ultimately came down to a penalty kick for CSUN by junior midfielder Kourtney Kutscher.</p>\n<p>Kutscher lined up for a one on one versus Ritter and sneaked a shot past the veteran goalkeeper to win the game. The overtime score was her fifth goal on the year, sending her senior teammates home with a 4-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite starting the year with a 0-2-1 record, UCSB now holds the No. 2 seed in the Big West Tournament. With the regular season finished, the Gauchos shift their focus onto postseason play, advancing to their first Big West Tournament since 2009. UCSB’s rematch versus third-seeded Cal State Fullerton will take place on Thursday, Nov. 5th at Titan Stadium. The semifinal match will be broadcasted on ESPN3 with a start time of 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66019\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66019\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/","id":1460,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1459,1458,1457],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Rise to the Occasion in Senior Day Duel","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MWaterPolo_BenPu-IMG_9065-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MWaterPolo_BenPu-IMG_9065-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"In its final home match of the regular season, the UCSB men's water team managed to persevere with a pivotal 6-5 comeback victory over UC Irvine.

Even prior to the match’s beginning fans frantically cheered. Fortunately the support of the Gauchos’ fan base did not go to waste as they witnessed UCSB pull off an incredible comeback to earn a last second victory.</p>\n<p>“Senior day, crowd roaring and a last second victory,” senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge excitedly explained. “This is a storybook ending for us seniors.”</p>\n<p>The match began with sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild netting a beautiful deep goal to get the Gauchos rolling. However, that would be the only goal UCSB would score in the first half. The first quarter ended with Santa Barbara up 1-0 but UCI added two goals in the second courtesy of junior utility Kyle Trush, and senior driver Jared Osborn to give the Anteaters a 2-1 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>The action picked up heavily in the third with UCI scoring quick on its first possession thanks to junior driver Lovre Milos. UCSB countered with a score of its own on the next opportunity to keep the deficit at one but Milos answered back on the next possession to give the Anteaters a commanding 4-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The frantic pace slowed down a bit until Milos netted his third goal of the quarter to take a 5-2 lead. Just as hope seemed to be dwindling, freshman attacker Spencer Likins made a huge goal for the Gauchos with just under 30 seconds left to pull them to within two scores.</p>\n<p>A two goal deficit heading into the final frame is not an easy thing to come back from, but on a day that held much significance, there was no way UCSB’s seniors were going to let this game get away. The quarter commenced with senior two-meter Liam Gaughan scoring a beautiful skip shot as the shot clock was expiring to bring the Gauchos within one. Later senior two-meter Nicholas Jordan made a great field block which eventually led to the game tying goal for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After UCI missed its final chance to take the lead, UCSB was left with 19 seconds and possession of the ball to try to win the match in regulation. The storybook ending came to fruition when Santa Barbara took the pool and senior attacker Derek Shoemaker scored the game-winning goal with .08 seconds left, giving the Gauchos the 6-5 victory.</p>\n<p>“It was just amazing,” Shoemaker stated while in awe. “I was a bit cold starting the game but my teammates believed in me and one went in when it really mattered.”</p>\n<p>The crowd roared after the final shot went in and joy seemed to strike every Gauchos’ face. A captain, team leader and most importantly senior made the biggest shot of the year for this team.</p>\n<p>“It was awesome for him to make that shot,” Wigo said. “Everyone is stoked for the way that turned out.”</p>\n<p>The outstanding performance of Whitelegge in his last home match as a Gaucho must be acknowledged as well as he made 11 incredible saves and whose great defense helped limit UCI to only five points. With those 11 saves, the senior became UCSB’s all-time saves leader and is now sixth all-time in MPSF career saves.</p>\n<p>“It’s so awesome I can’t even lie,” Whitelegge said. “To do it here on senior day in front of the crowd and my parents, it was just a great day overall.”</p>\n<p>Once again the Gauchos showed their resiliency in the pool and showed why they are a top MPSF team. The five seniors: Chris Whitelegge, Derek Shoemaker, Nick Jordan, Liam Gaughan, and Bryan Snyder all made great contributions both in and out of the pool throughout their time at UCSB and they have our admiration and best wishes as the season comes to a close.</p>\n<p>“All five guys are great and have made great contributions.” Wigo said. “They all influenced our team all these years and I could see they wanted this game. Congrats to them.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next match is Friday, Nov. 7<sup>th</sup> at undefeated UCLA at 7:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Yet, it was a superb night for freshman outside hitter Devin Joos, who recorded career-highs with 12 kills and a .258 hitting average.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always played back row so I was really excited to get that opportunity,” Joos said. “I think coach trusted me and as a player you feel more powerful when your coach stands behind you.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Enduring its third consecutive loss, UCSB is now 6-15 overall, 2-8 in conference play. The defeat places Santa Barbara in eighth-place of the Big West standings, its lowest ranking since finishing in seventh in 2007.</p>\n<p>Winners in eight of its last nine matches, Cal Poly boast a 16-5, 8-2 conference record. Its 16-5 overall record is its best start through 21 matches since 2006. Moreover, the Mustangs’ current Big West record is their best since 2008 and ties them for second-place in the standings with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>For the second time this season, three different Gauchos amassed double digit kills. Despite outhitting Cal Poly in the match’s first two sets, UCSB found itself having to play from behind, losing the first set.</p>\n<p>It was an assertive start by UCSB in the match’s opening as its energetic play generated a 4-0 lead over the Mustangs. But the Gauchos could not maintain their momentum as the occurrence of 10 UCSB errors helped fuel Cal Poly’s comeback to tie the score at 15-15.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs were able to benefit from the Gauchos’ mistakes, going on a 6-2 scoring rally to 21-18 lead to force a UCSB timeout. In spite of pulling within two at 22-24 with a block by junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Joos, a kill by sophomore Savannah Niemen captured the 1-0, 25- Cal Poly lead.</p>\n<p>The following set would go on to unfold in the same manner of a close battle between the two teams. Santa Barbara achieved another strong start, opening the set with a 6-3 lead but allowed a 4-0 Cal Poly run that gave the Mustangs a 7-6 lead. As both teams traded point, UCSB eventually took a late 21-19 lead. Determining the result of the second set was a trade-off of scoring runs. A 3-0 run helped Cal Poly go up 23-22, but the Gauchos responded with a 3-0 scoring rally of their own. Back-to-back kills by senior opposite Britton Taylor capped UCSB’s 25-23 win and knotted the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Helping lead UCSB to its tying set victory were senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau and senior opposite Jaylen Vllanueva. Although she stuggled with a match-high eight errors and a .061 attacking percentage, Barbeau registered 10 kills while Villanueva notched her third double-double of the season with 12 kills and 11 digs. The Gauchos also tied their season-high of 81 digs, led by 21 scoops from freshman Emilia Petrachi. They even outblocked the Mustangs 21 to 13 but that was not enough to prevent Cal Poly from securing the victory in the last two sets.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s defense achieved its goal of restraining Cal Poly’s freshman outside hitter Adlee Van Winden, holding her to just six kills on 51 attempts, it did not find a way to stop sophomore outside hitter Raeann Greisen.</p>\n<p>“They [Cal Poly] definitely played stronger towards the end of the match and that’s something that we need to fix, we were pretty flat in that last set,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch explained. “We gave up too many balls to Greisen in the seam. We needed to do a better job with our block on her.”</p>\n<p>Greisen continued her dominance against the Gauchos as she concluded Thursday with a match-high 14 kills. In addition to her performance, Niemen ended with 12 kills and a hitting clip of .450 while junior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald finished with 10 kills and a .348 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Offensively it was a tough night for both programs, but Cal Poly emerged with a match-high .294 attacking percentage in the third set. UCSB came within one, trailing 15-16 but could not maintain its hold on the Mustangs as they went on a 9-3 run to secure the set victory, extending their lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s momentum carried into the fourth set. It captured the lead and allowed just one early tie. The production of Greisen, Niemen, and Gruenewald happened to outperform the Gauchos’ play when it mattered most as they helped the Mustangs earn the 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB ended up with its fifteenth loss of the season, the Gauchos’ Joos felt indifferent about it being a negative for the team.</p>\n<p>“Mentally we won, even when we were down I felt like we were up. It’s just frustrating,” she said. “When I was out there, I could see that Cal Poly was scared. We just need to figure ourselves out and establish ourselves as a team better and have a little more pride.”</p>\n<p>UCSB gets a few days of rest without have any matches this weekend.
