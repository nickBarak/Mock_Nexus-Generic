We’ve had a good training camp, we’ve had good practices, we had some things go well in the Westmont game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I don’t think you’re ever quite ready to play Stanford in your first game no matter what your preparation is, but our schedule is built to play some of the top teams in the country and at some point, whether its first game or fifth game, we’re going to play teams like Stanford.”</p>\n<p>Last Saturday, Santa Barbara got its 2015 campaign off on the right foot as it took down Westmont 4-1 in the two teams’ annual preseason tune-up match. With five new starters in the lineup since the end of last season, the short amount of time that the Gauchos had in their first action together should be invaluable as they look to build chemistry prior to today’s game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Offensively we kind of got what we were looking for,” Vom Steeg said. “I think the area of importance for us is defensively. I thought that we needed to do better just in transition to our defense. Defensively I think we have quite a few things we have to do in order to get ready to play Stanford.”</p>\n<p>Stanford comes to town with high expectations for the year, boasting a No. 8 national ranking based on the NSCAA Coaches poll earlier this month. The Cardinal finished last season with a record of 13-3-3 overall and 6-1-3 in the conference, winning its first Pac-12 Title in 13 years in the process.</p>\n<p>One week after becoming conference champions, Stanford’s streak of nine unbeaten games was ended by a 1-0 loss in its first NCAA Tournament game to UC Irvine, the same team that knocked UCSB out of the Big West Tournament Semifinals. The Cardinal went 1-0-1 in its two preseason games this season, winning 2-0 against CSU Bakersfield before drawing 0-0 against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos last faced Stanford on the road in September of last year. A much more inexperienced team at the time, Santa Barbara fell behind early, giving up three goals within the first 12 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Stanford is particularly a good team this year but in general, they’re just a hard team to play against,” Vom Steeg said. “I do like us going into this game a lot better than we did last year. Last year we started five freshmen, so we’re a more experienced team. The players that were on the field last year when we played at Stanford, I wouldn’t say they want revenge, but you want to play that game again after what happened to us last year.”</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy will be the focal point of UCSB’s offense once again. The junior forward led the team with ten goals last season and got off to a good start with two goals against Westmont.</p>\n<p>“We know that [sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani] and Nick are going to be two really important players for us,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a number of players who have played two full seasons, but at the same time we had five new starters against Westmont, so that’s half your team.”</p>\n<p>For a team with hopes of making noise nationally this season, today’s game will be a good test to see how ready Santa Barbara is at this early stage. The Gauchos should be ready to go without injuries keeping key players out of the lineup, as they did for significant amounts of time last season.</p>\n<p>“[Freshman defender Sam Strong] will be a really good addition to our backline. He’s a player that we need in this kind of game,” Vom Steeg said. “Everybody else is in pretty good shape. There may be a couple of changes but it’ll be close to the starting group we had against Westmont.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against Stanford is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/","id":1523,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1522,1521,1520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Determined To End Winning Drought","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos and Spartans' set for Friday showdown at Harder Stadium ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_56798\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"230043448\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64591\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56798\" data-attachment-id=\"56798\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-soccer/wsoccer_vsucd-dustinharris-10122014-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=1600%2C1177&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1177\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413120587\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"115\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=888%2C653&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-56798\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?resize=310%2C228\" alt=\"Sophomore forward Amanda Ball striking for the goal.

I don’t expect that to happen in the future,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite being held scoreless in their last two defeats, the Gauchos have worked out their kinks in practice and are using their losses as motivation for their matchup against San Jose State this Friday.</p>\n<p>“One thing to take out of those losses is we didn’t score a goal in 180 minutes,” Stumpf said. “We’re facing a very good San Jose State team and this is going to be a game where we will get a few opportunities at the box. We’re looking for someone who can come up with one special moment in front of the goal.”</p>\n<p>The Spartans head into Harder Stadium with a 1-1 overall record. Although SJSU is a non-conference opponent, Stumpf believes these matches are exactly what UCSB needs in preparation for the team’s in-conference games.</p>\n<p>“We felt like getting a diverse group of coaching styles in the non-conference would help us with all the different styles we are going to see in the Big West,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>As far as players on the team, Stumpf anticipates an identity to be established in the front line, especially from sophomore forward Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>“Amanda has some great athleticism to her and is a very explosive player,” Stumpf said. “She’s had a couple lingering injuries that hindered her training, but we’re slowly but surely opening up her minutes and making her game fit.”</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Ball stepped up and started seven games for the Gauchos scoring two game-winning goals. She was the offensive anchor last Sunday, breaking down USF defenders and taking four of the Gauchos’ five shot attempts.</p>\n<p>Other notables include junior midfielder Sara Feder and senior forward Angelisa Cortez.</p>\n<p>Coming off a knee injury her sophomore year, Feder hit the ground running during her redshirt season starting 15 matches for the Gauchos and scoring a team-high five goals. The Colorado native earned recognition for her play by earning Honorable Mention All-Big West honors.</p>\n<p>In her final season in a blue and gold uniform, Cortez hopes her impressive play from last season can carry on to the field this year. Cortez tied for a team-high five goals and 13 points in her junior year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host its first non-conference game in Harder Stadium against San Jose State this Friday, August 28th. Tip off begins at 5 p.m. so make sure to cheer on our women’s soccer team as it hopes to earn its first victory of the 2015 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Lucky for you, you hit the jackpot. Welcome home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I know it’s an exciting time for you. You’re finally starting to get a taste of what adult life is. You’ve heard the stories about how awesome a party school UCSB is. You’re going to be surrounded by a ridiculous amount of the most beautiful people you’ve ever met, inside and out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It might be tough for you to leave everything you’ve ever known behind – your family and friends, the familiar streets you learned to drive on, your favorite restaurants, your dog – it’s not easy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But what you get in return: the ultimate fresh start.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Forget the ex who cheated on you, the bullies, the dumbasses, the people you’ve been going to school with since kindergarten that still don’t even know your name. Here in SB, we’re all in this together.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Right now, you have the power to control where your life goes. You can go down any path, and many times, you’re going to regret your decisions… Many, many, many times, actually.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But no matter what mistakes you make, never let a bad experience keep you down; learn from it, grow, and do whatever you can to make it a positive influence on your life moving forward.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If there’s one piece of advice I can emphasize more than anything, it is this: always have an open mind. No matter what you’ve thought about something in the past, at the very least, ask yourself “Why?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Why is Friends the greatest show ever? Why am I a Democrat instead of Republican? Why am I against drinking or doing drugs? Why do I believe in God?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Never be afraid of the answers to life’s hardest questions. This is the time for you to learn who you are and what your position is on important issues. As Aristotle once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the end of the day, college is only going to be what you make of it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Okay, now that I’ve imparted some life-changing wisdom that you’ll remember for the rest of your life, it’s time to talk about sports. You may not have seen too much of UCSB on ESPN or anything, but our teams do in fact kick ass.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For example, last season, our men’s volleyball, men’s water polo and baseball teams were ranked as high as No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6 in the nation, respectively.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I’m sure you’ve also heard about our men’s soccer team, which has finished with the No. 1 seed in the Big West in each of the last two seasons.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If you’re going to make it to any one game this season, make sure it’s men’s soccer against Cal Poly. When we hosted them last year, it was in front of the second-largest crowd in NCAA history. And if the image of tortillas flying recklessly through the air in all directions excites you, then you’ll be happy to hear that that’s how we celebrate goals. Make sure you cover your head, though.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, if you want to get in on the sports action yourself, then you’re also in luck. We have an excellent intramural community that gives you fun, organized competition for a large variety of sports and talent levels. You’ll sometimes even have the chance to play with UCSB athletes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For those of you that want to get behind the scenes, interviewing future professional athletes, writing articles about the sports you love and seeing what it’s like to be a journalist, then feel free to either e-mail us or come by the Nexus office and meet either myself or our assistant sports editor, Sean White.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So, with that being said, take a look down below and begin your tour of the teams you’ll be rooting for in the near future.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wishing you a fantastic and successful time here at UCSB,</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Michael J</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Gauchos Do It Better</strong> – Sean White</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you summer for the fun, but it’s time to get back to the grind. Welcome back to all the returning students, and greetings to the new class of freshmen. I hope all of you are ready to embark on your new journey as Gauchos!</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My name is Sean White (yes… almost like the snow/skate boarder) and I am entering my second-year as a Pre-Communication major. This is my second year as a writer and first-year as an editor for the Daily Nexus. I am looking forward to providing UCSB with the best content and coverage of its sports.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It’s crazy that I was just in your position preparing for my first year of college. Trust me, it goes by fast so make sure you enjoy every second of being a Gaucho.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My one suggestion for having a successful school year is simply making sure that you attend as many sporting events as possible. It’s the best way to overcome the stresses of school and take a break from the party scene. When you have teams that are talented and entertaining like UCSB does, it makes college more enjoyable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There’s no one sport at UCSB that I can tell you to commit to because they all have so much to offer. You’ve probably heard that UCSB is only a soccer powerhouse, but don’t let that deceive you. Our school may not receive much attention in mainstream sports headlines, but the experiences and memories gained from any UCSB sporting event are incomparable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While rankings and statistics help measure a team’s capability, it’s the atmosphere and energy of being in the Thunderdome, Harder Stadium, or any other UCSB venue that makes each moment meaningful. Since coming to UCSB, it has been the experience factor that has increased my interest in sports that I did not have much knowledge about.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As an only child, I guess you could call sports that brother or sister that I never had. I was once that kid with dreams of going to the NFL. Although UCSB does not have a football team, attending this school has made me realize how diverse sports are.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Writing for the Nexus has been everything that I hoped to do in my pursuit of a career within sports media and is responsible for my interest in learning more about sports such as volleyball, water polo, soccer, golf, and more. Even if you attend just one game, I hope that at the end of the school year you all can reminisce on the great times you had while cheering for our Gauchos.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With that being said, I hope all of you have a wonderful year.

Then, in 2010, one of the greatest goalscorers of our time in former French national and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry followed in Beckham’s footsteps by leaving Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona to play for the New York Red Bulls.</p>\n<p>In more recent days, there has been an eruption of stunning moves. Coinciding with the United States’ increased fan interest in soccer (thanks for making such a great videogame, FIFA), we’ve seen American nationals Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore, Jermaine Jones and Mix Diskerud all make the move back to home soil. Former FIFA World Player of the Year Kaká, Chelsea legend Didier Drogba, and Italy’s Sebastian Giovinco are just a few more of the big names that have joined the league in the past year.</p>\n<p>And you can’t forget Los Angeles’ very own Giovani dos Santos of the Mexican national team, who has been absolutely killing it for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Back to the game. It was evident even in pregame warm-ups who the best players on the pitch were, with Pirlo and Villa in a class all on their own. However, that didn’t stop a Galaxy side that has played together for some time from absolutely dominating the last 75 minutes.</p>\n<p>Pirlo looked like a parent playing with his kid’s youth team. Every time he touched the ball it was magnificent. He seemed to always find the right man, with one-touch passes finding their mark nearly every time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t have much help, and the game quickly fell out of his and a frustrated Villa’s hands as dos Santos, Gerrard and reigning MLS MVP Robbie Keane celebrated goals for most of the second half.</p>\n<p>Still, when Pirlo was subbed out late in the second half, he received a heartwarming standing ovation from a Los Angeles crowd that was happy just to be able to witness firsthand his incredible talent. Villa capped his day off by scoring a classy, well-deserved penalty, making the final score 5-1 and improving his mark to 15 goals in 22 appearances for NYC.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the all-important question: what is it about MLS that is enticing enough for these players to make the move across the Atlantic, where the sport they’ve called football their entire lives doesn’t even go by the same name anymore?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64502\" style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"789174628\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64502\" data-attachment-id=\"64502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/image-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"620,350\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64502 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=221%2C125\" alt=\"image\" width=\"221\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Villa (right) is Spain’s all-time leading goalscorer (59 goals) / Photo courtesy of mlssoccer.com</p></div>\n<p>Well, for one, as is evidenced by Villa’s high goalscoring rate and the fact that the Galaxy have tallied four or more goals in five of their last 10 league games, the defending in MLS is not quite at the same level as it is in Europe. Aging stars who can no longer easily beat the younger, defensive studs that Europe has to offer can find solace knowing that they can still make a significant impact over here. This goes hand-in-hand with the tendencies of American crowds to be number-centric, awarding praise to those who are able to provide objective, statistical truths as to why they are the best rather than through actual observation.</p>\n<p>Another key factor is the absence of relegation in MLS. While in top leagues such as La Liga and the English Premier League teams finishing in the bottom three spots of the standings are moved down to a lower division the following season, MLS teams can simply look to rebuild and start fresh after a disappointing campaign. This takes away from the stress that players in Europe feel every year about playing for a club that might not even be in the same league they signed up for in a few months.</p>\n<p>And, despite the negative connotation America holds in many parts of the world, players who have played overseas their entire lives can get a ticket not only to live in a country as great as the U.S., but to play the sport they love and get paid top dollar doing it. Not to mention, even if a player is at an away game, he’ll still most likely receive more praise than hate – the fans are happy enough to be able to see them play at all. Also, people like being praised.</p>\n<p>The most important thing that MLS provides these players though, as Steven Gerrard has <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/07/steven-gerrard-im-leaving-liverpool-for-la-galaxy-to-win-trophies-5012612/\">made clear ever since he decided to play for LA</a>, is the chance to compete for something that matters.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever in the U.S., soccer is important. Everywhere you go, people are more interested and more knowledgeable in the sport than they ever have been. The USWNT just won the World Cup, and it made record-breaking viewership numbers in doing so. FIFA is the best-selling videogame franchise in the world of sports.</p>\n<p>The talent levels and competition, the viewership and overall interest, the amount of monetary investment, and the overall perception of MLS and U.S. soccer are all on the rise. The league just made the jump from 18 teams to 20 this past season and has plans to add at least four more franchises in the coming years.</p>\n<p>It takes money to make anything happen, especially in an underdog league. Luckily, ownership in MLS has shown an increased willingness to spend. NYCFC itself is owned by Manchester City, perhaps the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs\">highest roller</a> in the Premier League at this point.</p>\n<p>Looking at where MLS was back in 2007 – when David Beckham announced he was moving to LA – to where it is now, the future is as bright as ever. The more teams start reeling in big names and improving the level of competition, the more that soccer culture in America will only continue to rise.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Heaven” returns to Harder Stadium this Saturday as the UCSB men’s soccer team plays its opening exhibition game against Westmont, giving both the team and the fans a first look at the newly reinforced Gaucho side.</p>\n<p>“The key for the Westmont game is, number one, you want to win the game. But you also want to have your first players do the things that you’ve been working on in training,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s also the only game that you can play your younger players and get them an opportunity to see how everything feels out on the field. You hope you can do all of that in one game.”</p>\n<p>The annual season-opening matchup, which has historically been dominated by UCSB, is the Gauchos’ only tune-up game before a hosting a difficult early-season challenge against Stanford next Friday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“All the teams that have done well in the past at UCSB have gone out in this Westmont game and have won by six or seven goals, so obviously we’re looking to send a message in this game to our future opponents,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’re just looking to do all the right things on the field so we can get a good result and send a message to the rest of the country that we’re here to play this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off its second straight successful campaign in 2014 in which it finished the regular season with a record of 10-7-3 overall and 6-2-2 in conference, good enough to secure a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament. Unfortunately, for the second straight year, the Gauchos fell by a final score of 3-2 in the Big West Tournament Semifinals, this time in a heartbreaker to UC Irvine, ending their hopes of making a run in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Ready to put last year behind them, the Gauchos are looking at this weekend as a welcome fresh start.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the last couple years, to be frank, it wasn’t good enough. What’s expected at UCSB is a lot better than what we’ve shown.” Backus said. “We’re looking to put this program back to where it needs to be and that’s at the top of the country. Everyone’s taken great pride in the shirt and as long as we sustain that excitement, with the level of talent that we have here, I don’t see a lot of teams being able to compete with us.”</p>\n<p>A big factor playing in UCSB’s favor this year will be the experience of its core group. Last year, the Gauchos saw a high number of underclassmen taking up a large share of the minutes on the field. While it may not have been an ideal situation at the time, the benefits from having key players receive all that play time should be clear once the season begins.</p>\n<p>“The last two years we’ve played a lot of young players, so now we see the benefit of seeing guys who have played 55-60 college games,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ll certainly know more about ourselves on Saturday but I like where we are right now and I like the attitude that we have on this team.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the three most crucial of the “young players” from the last two seasons are now juniors in forward Nick DePuy, left back Ismaila Jome and midfielder Drew Murphy. DePuy made the move to forward last season and led the team with 10 goals, including six game-winners, making national headlines and earning himself the Big West Offensive Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p>Jome and Murphy both shared the team lead with five assists apiece, helping earn them a spot alongside DePuy on this year’s Preseason All-Conference Team. UCSB also received seven out of eight first-place votes in the preseason coaches poll to win the Big West North Division for the third straight year.</p>\n<p>“We’re in good shape in terms of having options,” Vom Steeg said. “Nick will be a center point of our attack, but unlike last year where if he scored we usually won and if he didn’t score we usually didn’t win, we’re going to have lots of different scoring options.”</p>\n<p>Another issue which plagued Santa Barbara all last season was the impact of injuries on the team’s depth, particularly in the midfield. Halfway through the conference season, Vom Steeg was even forced to put sophomore midfielder Andy Perez, who had been redshirting the entire season, into the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>However, luck has been on the Gauchos’ side thus far in the preseason in terms of their health.</p>\n<p>“I think the question mark is going to be what we do out of midfield. I think we have some flexibility,” Vom Steeg said. “Coming out of training camp we have one injury, so we have 28 players available. We’re in good shape.”</p>\n<p>UCSB kicks off the season with its annual exhibition against Westmont at 7:00 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Years and years of research has been done and continues as the search to discover a cure for cancer persist. It’s an illness that even the most healthful individual cannot predict to occur in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>For Kansas City Chiefs’ strong safety Eric Berry, week six of the 2014 NFL season will forever be a life-changing experience. On December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2014, news surfaced that Berry was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma.</p>\n<p>After missing the remainder of last season, Berry is set to make his return tomorrow night in the Chiefs preseason opener against the Arizona Cardinals. While it is not determined how much playing time he will receive, Berry has been making encouraging strides in training camp. Just last Thursday, Berry sent the sports world into a frenzy after making a diving interception during practice.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The fifth overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft from the University of Tennessee, Berry has been a relentless force since entering the league. His hard-nosed, aggressive playing style allowed him to have an immediate impact as he earned the starting safety spot in his first season and has excelled ever since.</p>\n<p>Battling cancer is an unfathomable challenge that one can only hope to survive. Berry’s fearless spirit while facing his battle with cancer is exemplary of a courageous warrior disguised as a football player.</p>\n<p>The grueling treatment of chemotherapy is a process that usually causes the physical and psychological strength of cancer stricken individuals to plummet. However, for Berry the time spent during recovery was a period that displayed his dedication and commitment to not surrender.</p>\n<p>During each chemotherapy session, Berry had an IV inserted into his body in order to work out while under treatment. By the end of his treatment, Berry was one pound heavier than when he first was diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Berry’s superhuman abilities may set him aside from others, but he has become another example for people worldwide. His devotion while on his road to recovery is motivation for individuals that are ill or healthy to never take life for granted and to embrace its challenges.</p>\n<p>While Berry’s health and ability to persevere is paramount in him getting back on the field, the NFL’s support during his absence was just as important. Players, fans, and teams all over the league joined in support of the “Berry Strong” campaign. Most notably, t-shirts boasting the slogan of “Be Bold, Be Brave, Be Berry,” became a popular choice of support by many.</p>\n<p>Of course we’re all glad to see the return of football with the NFL preseason, but tomorrow night’s game has an overarching importance that goes beyond the field. It’s the brotherhood and unity within the NFL that will be in full effect tomorrow as we all welcome Eric Berry back.</p>\n<p>Berry’s recovery continues as he works himself back into the first-team All-Pro, three-time Pro Bowler that we know him to be. While it may take a while to return to that elite level, expect Berry to prove any limitation upon him wrong.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-14/berrystrong-lives-on/","id":3283,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3282,3281,3280],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Special Olympics: Not All Superheroes Wear Capes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What makes someone a hero?

This iconic ceremony let the world know that being a great athlete isn’t decided by one’s physical appearance or abilities, but rather by strength within.</p>\n<p>Take Scott Rohrer as a prime example. An individual that suffers from autism, Rohrer did not let his medical condition be a setback.</p>\n<p>The Special Olympics Team USA golfer earned himself a new record on Sunday posting a career low 276, or 12 under par. The golfer’s success has been a common occurrence during the Special Olympics winning three gold medals in 2007, 2009, and 2011.</p>\n<p>Rohrer told ESPN that in all of his golf moments, winning Special Olympics gold ranks “at the top.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never felt anything like this before and it’s a true honor,” he said.</p>\n<p>The four-time champ was not the only athlete that made his mark on Sunday. After 38 battles with liver malfunctions, kidney defects, and strokes, the 5-foot, 2-inch Chevi Peters proved doubters wrong putting on that Team USA uniform.</p>\n<p>With a little lift from his trainer John Lair, Peters accomplished one of his biggest dreams on Sunday – taking first place in the Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>The Kansas native qualified for the combination event, a series of three lifts starting with squats, bench-press, and deadlifts. After pressing a combined 408 pounds in the squat and bench only one more lift stood in the way of Peter’s gold medal.</p>\n<p>Deadlifting a total of 325 pounds and finishing the event with a total of 733 pounds, the “Manimal” lived up to his nickname and embraced his coach in an emotional victory.</p>\n<p>“If you put your mind to it with hard work and dedication anything is possible,” Peters said in an interview with ESPN.</p>\n<p>The lifter went home to Parsons, Kansas with 4 medals in total, one silver and three gold.</p>\n<p>His will to never give up is a testament to younger ones everywhere. Peters proved that dreams can come true and that you can inspire those around you.

four-year, $87.6 million ($60 million guaranteed) contract extension with the Seattle Seahawks is an offseason move that we eventually expected and are all glad to see be completed.</p>\n<p>There was much curiosity as to whether or not Seattle and Wilson would come to an agreement before the start of training camp. Despite Wilson’s new contract not ending with him being the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL, it’s a much more comforting difference from the $1.5 million salary he was set to make heading into the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>Wilson is now the second highest-paid quarterback in the NFL behind the Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers with an average salary per year of $17.82 million. Also, his $60 million in guaranteed money is tied for third-most in the NFL among current quarterback contracts behind Pittsburg’s Ben Roethlisberger and San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While on paper Wilson is set to make more than half the amount of money his contract entitles, that guaranteed money doesn’t fully become his just yet.</p>\n<p>Of the $60 million Wilson plans on making in guaranteed money, only the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/russell-wilson-contract-guarantees-2015-8\">first year of his four-year contract</a>–$31.7 million, is fully guaranteed. The total of $31. 7 million stems from a $31 million signing bonus and $700 thousand base salary.</p>\n<p>With the rest of Wilson’s contract depending on his future as the Seahawk’s quarterback, it’s assumed that he will definitely remain in Seattle and collect the money he is owed.</p>\n<p>As Seattle tries to retain as many of its primary impact players that have helped the Seahawks get to two consecutive Super Bowls, not giving Wilson the top notch contract he wanted is just fine.</p>\n<p>With the Seahawks salary cap already spent on keeping players such as Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Marshawn Lynch, and recently Bobby Wagner, now the NFL’s highest-paid middle linebacker after signing a four-year extension worth $43 million ($22 million guaranteed), <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/08/03/seahawks-cant-pay-many-any-more-guys/\">Seattle can only spend so much on players it plans on keeping for the future.</a></p>\n<p>While Seattle may have thought it was done handing out contract extensions, star safety Kam Chancellor is currently holding out from training camp in search of more money. After signing a contract extension with the Seahawks in 2013 worth $35 million for five-years, Chancellor is scheduled to make a base salary of $4.55 million this season.</p>\n<p>In the midst of negotiating player contracts, Seattle has begun its process of releasing players in order to increase salary cap space. Surprisingly, starting defensive tackle Tony McDaniel was released and it’s expected that the Seahawks will probably cut more players and search for cheaper talent. Although McDaniel has been a pivotal piece of Seattle’s defensive front, it’s amazing to see how the business of professional sports outweighs performance sometimes.</p>\n<p>Situations such as Chancellor’s and various others that have decided to hold out are examples of why players have voiced their opinions in the past. In regard to contracts, with the NFL being one of the nation’s top sports industries, players believe that they deserve the guaranteed money and leverage when negotiating that NBA and MLB players have.</p>\n<p>For instance, back in May Minnesota Vikings’ running back Adrian Peterson stated his <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/adrian-peterson-twitter-4\">frustration of franchises having control over player contracts. </a></p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how things pan out between Chancellor and the Seahawks. At the end of the day, Seattle’s effort and success to maintain key pieces must be applauded. However, is it too concerned with keeping its best players and ignoring the possibility of underpaying its role players?</p>\n<p>No one knows what Seattle’s next decision concerning its roster</p>\n<p>will be, but knowing that Wilson will be a Seahawk for years to come is the team’s biggest win so far this offseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During the final, a total of 30.9 million people tuned in to watch the match.

This push has been slowly accelerating since the new millennium, and this newfound attention to women’s sports could be the evidence of its success. The era of women’s sports is clearly upon us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64407\" style=\"width: 314px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Caitlyn-Jenner.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"65860626\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64407\" data-attachment-id=\"64407\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/caitlyn-jenner/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Caitlyn-Jenner.jpg?fit=780%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"780,438\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Caitlyn Jenner\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Caitlyn-Jenner.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Caitlyn-Jenner.jpg?fit=780%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"  wp-image-64407\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Caitlyn-Jenner.jpg?resize=304%2C171\" alt=\"Caitlyn Jenner\" width=\"304\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Caitlyn-Jenner.jpg?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Caitlyn-Jenner.jpg?resize=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64407\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of cnn.com</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Caitlyn Jenner Wins Arthur Ashe Award</strong> by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many have criticized the decision to award Caitlyn Jenner, the woman formerly known as Bruce, with the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage, especially considering that it happened at the ESPYs, the world’s foremost sports awards event. Sportscaster Bob Costas has gone so far as to call it a “crass exploitation play,” an effort by ESPN to increase its viewership. Let’s not forget that Caitlyn once stood atop the sporting world by winning the gold medal for the decathlon way back in the 1976 Summer Olympics. Just because she has since come out publically with her true identity, this doesn’t take away from the fact that she is as much a historical sports figure as she ever was and as deserving of the award as anyone. She has saved thousands of lives and influenced many more to be true to themselves, making this not only a win for the LGBTQ community, but a win for our increasingly accepting and constantly evolving society as a whole.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64408\" style=\"width: 265px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1147706998\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64408\" data-attachment-id=\"64408\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/becky/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?fit=960%2C703&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,703\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Becky\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?fit=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?fit=888%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64408\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?resize=255%2C187\" alt=\"Becky\" width=\"255\" height=\"187\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?resize=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64408\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of kirotv.com</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>First-Ever Female NBA Coach Wins Summer League Title </strong>by Elliot Thornton</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The NBA Summer League is officially a wrap. This Vegas showcase is where college rookies take center stage and prove to GMs why they deserve a shot to be in the pros. But this summer wasn’t all about the players — it was also about a coach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Becky Hammon led the San Antonio Spurs to their first summer league championship as the first female head coach in NBA history. In a dogfight against the Phoenix Suns with over 80,000 fans in attendance, it was Hammon’s coaching and poise that led her Spurs to a dramatic 93-90 victory.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Following 15 years in the WNBA, Hammon decided to put her pro career aside and do something no other female would dare try: join the NBA. On Aug. 5, 2014 the San Antonio Spurs hired Hammon as the first-ever female assistant coach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Under the wing of mentor Gregg Popovich, the former San Antonio Star learned the ropes of the NBA very quickly. The torch was passed this summer as she took over the men’s summer league team and she didn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hammon’s journey to the NBA has been remarkable. From being an undrafted rookie in the WNBA to her six all-star appearances in the league and now having a Summer League title under her belt, critics can only applaud her accomplishments. But her job is not done yet.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For now, it’s safe to say that Becky Hammon has a heart of a champion, breaking barriers not only for herself, but for women everywhere.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64410\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Serena.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1942169891\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64410\" data-attachment-id=\"64410\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/celebrities-at-wimbledon-2015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Serena.jpg?fit=636%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"636,421\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;WireImage&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 11:  Serena Williams of the United States celebrates with the Venus Rosewater Dish after her victory in the Final Of The Ladies' Singles against Garbine Muguruza of Spain during day twelve of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships at Wimbledon on July 11, 2015 in London, England.

But at the age of 33, Serena Williams remains one of the most dominant athletes in the world. On July 11, Williams heightened her prominence atop women’s tennis by earning her 21st Grand Slam victory at Wimbledon.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As Williams’ name continues to ascend in the record books amongst the legendary careers of players such as Germany’s Steffi Graf and Australia’s Margaret Smith Court, the nation’s No. 1 player recreated her own history with the win.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It had been 12 years since she achieved her first “Serena Slam,” but after winning at Wimbledon, Williams repeated the feat of being tennis’ ultimate winner. This year’s “Serena Slam” is the second time in Williams’s career that she is the current champion of each of the four Grand Slam events. Also, the victory at Wimbledon made Williams the oldest women’s tennis player to win a Grand Slam event.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, you may be questioning what is left for Williams to conquer in the latter years of her career, but the answer is simple: to win. Besides being just one win away from tying Graff’s record of 22 Grand Slam titles, Williams is on the verge of achieving a task she never has before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nearly a month away from its arrival in September, the U.S. Open is the next major event that Williams is scheduled to play in. A win in this event would not only award Williams with her seventh U.S. Open, but it would place her on women’s tennis’ most prestigious platform. Williams would become just the second player to win each of the Grand Slam events in the same calendar year, Graf being the first.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64411\" style=\"width: 273px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pierre.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1526036065\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64411\" data-attachment-id=\"64411\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/pierre/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pierre.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Tim Heitman\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D X\",\"caption\":\"Sep 8, 2013; Arlington, TX, USA;  New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul (90) on the sidelines during the fourth quarter of the game against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&amp;T Stadium.

Players have gone as far as to donate thousands of dollars in support of researching the best protective gear and, in some cases, even sued their respective leagues for the unfortunate outcomes that are connected to physical activity in their sport of play. It seems as if most athletes take their own safety into heavy consideration when on the field of play, so it is very surprising to hear of acts where athletes fail to display this attention when off the field.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Just this past Independence Day, NFL players Jason Pierre-Paul of the New York Giants and CJ Wilson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers both suffered finger amputations due to injuries sustained during separate firework accidents. Pierre-Paul lost his right index finger while Watson lost both his right index and middle fingers. Given their defensive positions, these injuries have proven to be career-altering. Pierre-Paul, who was franchise tagged, but hoping to earn a long-term deal instead, lost his opportunity of the desired deal just hours after the accident. Moreover, Wilson’s incident led him to recently retire with hopes of returning to the NFL once recovered and healthy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It is hard to understand how these players, who are concerned with safety so much in the game, can sometimes be very careless outside of it. Both of these men make a living using their hands, and their actions could have cost their teams, families and themselves a lot more. Although this may be the most severe occurrence in outside injuries, this is not the only example. We can point to Andrew Bynum who missed an entire season with the Philadelphia 76ers after hurting his leg bowling. Or Rory Mcllroy, who just missed the British Open due to a ruptured Achilles he got while playing soccer. It’s inevitable that these accidents do happen, but one would expect athletes of professional caliber to be more responsible.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"685842556\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64412\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/big-al/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?fit=320%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"320,238\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"big al\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?fit=320%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"  wp-image-64412 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?resize=246%2C183\" alt=\"big al\" width=\"246\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>‘Big Al’ Heading to China </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Whether you follow UCSB sports or not, you’ve most likely at some point heard of “Big Al,” the UCSB men’s basketball team’s all-time leader in rebounds and second all-time leader in points.

It left Los Angeles Clippers fans startled by the fact that their star center was off to Dallas to clean up boards for their conference rivals.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But as the days passed and rumors swirled about the potential return of Jordan to L.A., the tables turned against Mavericks fans which made the hearts of Clippers fans swell with joy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For the last seven seasons, the athletic Jordan has filled highlight reels and been a driving force behind the birth of “Lob City.” His defense and rebounding are irreplaceable and it was hard to imagine a title run without “DJ” in the mix.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Suddenly, the urgent scramble to lure Jordan back to L.A. led Clippers players, owners and coaches to “camp out” at Jordan’s Houston home until the moratorium period ended.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Before anyone knew it, the weirdest offseason situation in recent memory ended with DeAndre Jordan returning to Los Angeles and leaving Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and fans with a bitter taste in their mouths.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Although this may be one of the most surprising free agency scandals ever witnessed, one thing is for sure: The Clippers are loaded, and Lob City will be in full effect this season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>NFL Offseason’s Biggest Moves </strong>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an offseason that is crowded by suspensions and lawsuits, the actual trades and pickups being made by NFL teams have been deflated in media coverage to this point. This has definitely been unfortunate due to the fact that this offseason has been very exciting for many players and a couple of teams in particular.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Indianapolis Colts, who already have one of the best quarterbacks in the league, a strong defense and a great group of receivers, added some phenomenal pieces to complete their all-star caliber team. This season, Frank Gore and Andre Johnson will suit up in blue to revamp an already potent offense. In addition, the Colts got more protection for Andrew Luck in Todd Herremans and added savvy veterans in Kendall Langford and Trent Cole to their defense. Simply put, Indianapolis is deserving of being one of Vegas’s Super Bowl winning predictions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Buffalo Bills have become very intriguing with their pickups that include new Head Coach Rex Ryan and a defense he is building for himself. With LeSean “Shady” McCoy on board, the Bills have a very exciting offense that could possibly shock many with quarterback Matt Cassel being the team’s possible starter. Quite honestly, Buffalo will be just as hit-or-miss as the team McCoy came from.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Chip Kelly has set himself up to be either the biggest hero or the biggest bonehead in Philadelphia Eagles history. He has completely redesigned a team that had a 10-6 record under Mark Sanchez last year. Only time will tell if Chip is impulsive or wise in moves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the individual side, Ndamukong Suh and Jimmy Graham have made the biggest moves, racking up some cash along the way. Suh moved to the Dolphins and became the highest paid non-quarterback in the NFL as Graham joined the Seattle Seahawks. It’s too bad the Seahawks didn’t have Graham for that last red zone pass … just maybe, things would have ended differently.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Sepp Blatter Finally Gets the Boot </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Well, it’s about damn time. After FBI investigators finally stepped in to take a look at the blatant corruption taking place within the soccer world, Sepp Blatter was finally forced to step down as FIFA president in early June. Maybe we won’t have the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after all. Good riddance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>College Football Playoffs Part II</strong> by Elliot Thornton</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2014, a new era of college football was born with the College Football Playoffs. After a back-and-forth battle between the top two teams, the Ohio State Buckeyes and Oregon Ducks, the second-half surge of running back Ezekiel Elliott sealed the deal for the Buckeyes and crowned them the first ever College Football Playoff champions with a 42-20 victory.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But as last season is put to rest and a new season approaches, all eyes are on Head Coach Urban Meyer and his crew to prove themselves against the toughest competition in the nation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Among these teams lies the rolling Alabama Crimson Tide. After a 35-42 upset and a long ride back to Tuscaloosa, Head Coach Nick Saban and his men stored that bitter loss to Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl in their memory and are out for vengeance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While losing a couple key pieces from their run to the championship game last year, like quarterback Blake Sims, running back T.J. Yeldon and star wideout Amari Cooper, younger talent has emerged and is ready to step up.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Derrick Henry hopes to be the primary weapon for the Crimson Tide offense. The junior running back took 170 handoffs behind Yeldon last year and averaged a staggering 5.8 yards per carry. Henry also led the team in rushing with 990 yards and broke the plane 11 times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With a 6’3″ 240 lb frame, Henry will be a valuable asset to Saban and his dominant offensive line.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another team on the rise is Bama rival, the Auburn Tigers. With the departure of quarterback Nick Marshall to the NFL draft, expectations are high for Head Coach Gus Malzahn and his new team.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The sky is the limit for quarterback Jeremy Johnson. The junior impressed scouts in the Auburn spring game on July 19th, passing for 252 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While Auburn’s defense is a concern on the back end and the timetable of injured lineman Carl Lawson is still questionable, there is no doubt that the Tigers will make a solid run in the talented SEC.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Clippers Going All-In With Championship-or-Bust Mentality </strong>by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sixteen NBA championships have been won in the city of Los Angeles; however, none of them belong to the Clippers. Still, the momentum has clearly shifted the last few years as the Clippers have won 50-plus games for the past three consecutive seasons while the Lakers have had some of their worst seasons in franchise history.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With hopes of winning their first championship in team history, this offseason has shown that “Lob City” will do whatever it takes to win it all. After a disappointing loss to the Houston Rockets in the second round of the NBA Playoffs, (as a life-long Clippers fan this still pains me to write) the Clippers took the “if you can’t beat them, sign them” approach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Clippers added NBA veterans Josh Smith and Pablo Prigioni, both members of the Rockets this past season, to provide some much-needed depth to a bench that was highly criticized throughout the year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Smith is the much more talented of the two, and will undoubtedly contribute more. Nonetheless, Prigioni’s defense and energy off the bench will be huge down the stretch when an aging Chris Paul needs a few extra minutes on the bench.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Los Angeles’ other two moves earlier in the offseason highlighted the “championship or bust” mentality they are taking into this season. The Clippers added fiery guard Lance Stephenson in a trade that sent Matt Barnes to Charlotte, who is now with the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Stephenson is most commonly known for blowing in LeBron James’ ear when the Pacers played the Heat in the 2014 Eastern Conference Finals. But what people do not remember is how well Stephenson played LeBron defensively. He will be able to match up with the best players’ night in and night out, which will be huge on decreasing the minutes for players like Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and the Clippers’ final offseason addition, Paul Pierce.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ten-time all-star is reuniting with his former Head Coach Doc Rivers, whom he won a championship with in Boston back in 2008. While he is in the twilight of his career, Pierce’s finals experience and clutch scoring are still prevalent and can provide a huge boost for the Clippers if they make it deep into the postseason.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Team USA Finishes Fourth in Gold Cup </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Defending champion team USA had been to the Gold Cup Final every time since 2003. A 2-1 loss on home soil to Jamaica in this year’s semis was a huge step back for a team that has been on the rise.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Other Major NBA Storylines…</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Lakers draft D’Angelo Russell No. 2 overall over Jahlil Okafor</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">LaMarcus Aldridge signs with Spurs for four years, $80 million</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Kevin Love re-signs with Cavs for five years, $110 million</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Cueto is a rental player who will be too expensive for Kansas City to keep at the end of the season, but the Royals have the potential to go back to the World Series again this year, so they knew it was their time to make a splash at the trade deadline for arguably the best pitcher available.</p>\n<p>Other trades of note include starting pitcher Scott Kazmir going from the Oakland Athletics to the Houston Astros, who are still surprising many critics who did not believe this young team would be ready to compete for a couple more years.  Outfielder Shane Victorino is now an Angel, reliever Tyler Clippard a Met, and Jose Reyes is a Rockie.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With two wildcard spots in each league, there are so many more teams in the hunt for a playoff spot, making it harder for teams to call themselves sellers. The Cubs, Mets, Giants, and Pirates are all contenders in the National League, and it will be entertaining to see which of these teams makes the biggest move to try and win a place in the wildcard game. Expect the Chicago Cubs to do something big this week, working a trade for either David Price or Cole Hamels, the two top remaining starters on the market.</p>\n<p>In the American League, the Toronto Blue Jays need pitching in order to give themselves a chance at a playoff spot, something they haven’t achieved since they won consecutive World Series titles in 1992-1993. This team has the best offense in baseball, but the eighth worst pitching staff. After picking up Troy Tulowitzki from Colorado, look for Toronto to pick up the White Sox’ ace Jeff Samardzija to bolster its pitching staff.</p>\n<p>Looking at the rest of the AL, the Minnesota Twins have to make a trade if they want to have a chance at making the playoffs. This team is a head-scratcher and I’m surprised they are in the position they are in, but if they don’t trade for a bat like the Padres’ Justin Upton, the Twins will fall out of the playoff race soon.</p>\n<p>With not many hours left, hopefully your favorite team’s general manager doesn’t doze off and miss the opportunity to get your team to the promise land.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Currently, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is the next candidate in line for a major payday. While some may disagree, Wilson seems to be the ideal frontrunner for young quarterbacks on the brink of sealing the coveted “elite” label.</p>\n<p>Constant speculation of the contract negotiations between Wilson and the Seahawks have generated the possibility of him becoming the highest-paid player in the NFL. Despite being drafted as the 75<sup>th</sup> pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft in which five different quarterbacks were drafted before him, Wilson has proved that he belongs and can survive in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Of that 2012 draft class, Wilson, Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Tannehill are the only names of quarterbacks that are still prevalent within NFL storylines. While Luck was the No. 1 overall draft pick and first quarterback off the board, Wilson has had the most success out of the 2012 draftees.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Entering the final year of his rookie contract with a set salary of $1.5 million, the Seahawks’ field general is well deserving of a multi-year contract that could make him the NFL’s richest man. With quarterbacks like Cam Newton, Tannehill, RG3 earning contract extensions, and Luck with plans of receiving a surplus of money, the legendary slogan of “numbers never lie” is the one thing that separates Wilson from the rest.</p>\n<p>Since entering the league in 2012, Wilson’s 36 regular-season wins are the most by any quarterback in his first three seasons, he has an NFL-high 15 fourth quarter/comeback victories, and helped lead Seattle to its first Super Bowl win in franchise history out of two consecutive championship trips.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversial play call that resulted with a game-winning interception by Malcolm Butler to secure the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory, it is inevitable that Wilson has completely transformed the Seahawks from being a below average team into a consistent postseason contender. Prior to Wilson’s arrival, Seattle had not won a playoff game since its upset victory versus the New Orleans Saints in 2010.</p>\n<p>Besides proving himself as a quarterback capable of competing and winning at the NFL level, Wilson’s dual-threat skillset is another viable attribute that must be valued during contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>His combination of being an efficient pocket passer and his playmaking abilities when on the run are what have allowed him to become one of the NFL’s current best quarterbacks. While injuries have plagued the former 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year in RG3 and Newton possessing these same dual-threat talents, Wilson has perfected the balance between passing and rushing the ball. While the numbers may not show significant changes, Wilson has gradually improved each season in both statistical categories.</p>\n<p>However, while Wilson’s performance has been the primary drive behind the Seahawks’ resurgence, the supporting cast of having the NFL’s best defense and arguably best running back in Marshawn Lynch are factors that lead to Seattle’s caution when negotiating the quarterback’s long-term contract.</p>\n<p>Whenever Wilson has been unable to produce for Seattle offensively, it has been the Seahawks defense that has carried the load. Primarily led by original “Legion of Boom” members such as Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas III, the Seahawks defense has consistently ranked amongst the top in points, passing, rushing, and total yards allowed.</p>\n<p>Commonly known for his “Beastmode” moniker, Lynch’s downhill, gritty running style has definitely made Wilson’s quarterbacking job a lot easier. Despite a slow start to his first year as a Seahawk in 2010, Lynch has rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his last four seasons.  He tied for an NFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns and finished fifth in total rushing yards with 1,306 this past season.</p>\n<p>The fact that Wilson has yet to throw 30-plus touchdown passes or break the 4,000 yard mark for passing in his career may be alarming for some, but it doesn’t mean the man doesn’t deserve his money. With the addition of tight-end Jimmy Graham, Wilson has another weapon in his arsenal that can help elevate his stature on the field.</p>\n<p>While some may not even consider him to be a top-five NFL quarterback, Wilson has undoubtedly helped turn Seattle into a winning organization. At the end of the day, the Seahawks must realize how valuable of a steal Wilson has been since his arrival in Seattle and can show their appreciation for him with a new contract this offseason.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/","id":3280,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3279,3278,3277],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Packer Nation Welcomes Favre With Open Arms","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Brett Favre's unforeseen return to Green Bay comes true ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_64341\" style=\"width: 414px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"111848347\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64339\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64341\" data-attachment-id=\"64341\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-22/packer-nation-welcomes-favre-with-open-arms/favre/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?fit=400%2C260&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,260\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"favre\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?fit=400%2C260&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64341\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?resize=404%2C262\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of kenoshanews.com\" width=\"404\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favre.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of kenoshanews.com</p></div>\n<p>Brett Favre never thought this day would occur.

A plague of losing seasons overtook the franchise and changes were made with the hiring of Head Coach Mike Holmgren. With a new coaching staff in place and a gun-slinging quarterback at the helm in Brett Favre, the Packers brought back a competitive spirit to their hometown.</p>\n<p>Green Bay made its first postseason appearance since 1983 after the quarterback’s arrival. Favre led the Packers to a total of 11 playoff runs, finishing with the record for most passing yards, touchdowns, and pass completions in team history.</p>\n<p>With this type of resume, not to mention a record of 160 wins as a Packer, Favre rightfully deserves a seat next to the yellow and green greats.</p>\n<p>Brett Favre is one of six Packers ever to have a banner hanging in Lambeau Field. With a stadium that features some of the greatest football athletes to play the game like Bart Starr, Reggie White, and football mastermind Vince Lombardi, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13280080/brett-favre-humbled-fan-response-green-bay-packers-hall-fame-induction\">“It’s quite an honor”, Favre said. “When you look at the players that go into this [category] and to be a part of that it’s hard to put into words.”</a></p>\n<p>Favre’s sixteen years of two minute drives, Super Bowl runs, and “Lambeau leaps” as a Packer outweigh his decision of exiting retirement and joining the rival Vikings. Sure some hearts were broken since his seven-year split with the team, but from this moment on that is water under the bridge. Favre’s return brings him back to his true home and his remembrance in Green Bay will forever be a grateful one.</p>\n<p>While the fans pay tribute to his career in a green and yellow uniform, it is Favre himself who is really saying thank you. The three NFL MVP awards, Superbowl XXXI ring, and career in the NFL are accredited to the loyal fans of Wisconsin and their support throughout the years. Through triumph and adversity, they stuck with the Southern quarterback from Gulfport, Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Brett Favre has accomplished many milestones since his start in the NFL. The 19-year veteran has surpassed greats in records, been at the highest pinnacle of football, and distinguished himself as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever step foot on a field. But having his No. 4 jersey hung up in Lambeau has to be the sweetest victory of all. After facing boos and chants of “traitor” while being a Jet and Viking, Favre assumed that would be the end of his journey in Green Bay. But last Saturday surely put his fears to rest as his journey lives on as a Packer. From this day on he will never be forgotten as one. The induction ceremony was a day full of the cheers and chants that Favre had become accustomed to while in Green Bay.

Will they be able to rise to the occasion and make a run for the next world cup?</p>\n<p>After a disappointing loss to Belgium in the round of 16, Head Coach Jurgen Klinsmann and his team are focused for the upcoming opportunity. Although a young team lacking veteran leadership following the retirement of Landon Donovan, new faces and talent will step in place as they start their journey to Russia.</p>\n<p>Among these players lies the 23-year old striker Gyasi Zardes. The LA Galaxy forward subbed in the second half for Team USA and within 61-seconds assisted captain Clint Dempsey for the only goal scored in the game. Turns out the bright lights and big stage wasn’t too much for the young soccer player as he shined in the spotlight and continued to be in attack mode for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Dempsey was impressed by Zardes’ play, calling the forward a “dynamic” player that “will play a big part in the national team picture moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Other players on the rise include midfielder Alejandro Bedoya and goalkeeper Brad Guzan. The duo have been two critical components of Team USA’s success, specifically Bedoya’s play during the World Cup in Brazil and Guzan’s time in the Gold Cup since replacing fan favorite Tim Howard.</p>\n<p>Bedoya’s poise with the ball on the offensive end has been phenomenal. The New Jersey native put perfect placement on the ball for captain Michael Bradley to lock things up in a 1-1 stalemate against Panama on Tuesday. After learning so much in Brazil, Bedoya has stepped up to the plate and become a leader during Team USA’s summer run.</p>\n<p>Guzan has made an impact from the get go since replacing long-time goalie Tim Howard. In the five games that he’s started, the 30-year old has hosted a goal difference of +8, only conceding a total of five goals. Guzan also had seven saves in USA’s victory against Panama Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, it is the combined efforts of role players like Zardes, Bedoya, and Guzan that make the difference and will be the X-factor in giving Team USA a run in 2018. This roster isn’t centered around one major star like a Ronaldo or Messi but consists of a melting pot of role players that can impact the game with full force. If they work together as a unit this team may follow in the footsteps of the great US women’s national team.</p>\n<p>This is a new era for American soccer. After crucial years of tough losses and decisive heartbreakers, the time has come for the US to prove to others that it can be champions on the pitch. Now that the women’s team has done its part, it is up to the men to carry the torch.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/","id":3260,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3259,3258,3257],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ball Up: Post NBA Draft Insight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Assistant sports editor Sean White announces his Top 5 picks from the 2015 NBA Draft","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With NBA Free Agency in full effect, the excitement surrounding NBA headlines of the latest player signings and trades has been a wonderful start to the month of July.

His versatile skillset enables him to play on the wing or small forward position as he can defend and produce offensively on both ends of the court. Winslow’s “x-factor” role in the Blue Devils lineup was the necessary piece to their championship run. The NCAA Tournament is where he shined most as he averaged 14.3 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.7 blocks and 1.5 steals per game.</p>\n<p>While Winslow is a great slasher and on-ball defender, improving his shooting range is the next step to his NBA transition. It’s a surprise that Winslow slipped to the No. 10 spot, but the Miami Heat are smart for drafting a player of his caliber. Playing in the Eastern Conference, the Heat are already talented enough to contend for a top spot. With the return of shooting guard Dwayne Wade, forward Luol Deng, guard Goran Dragic, and a healthy power forward in Chris Bosh, Winslow could not be in a better situation that could continue his winning in college to the pros.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>D’ Angelo Russell, PG- LOS ANGELES LAKERS (OHIO STATE) </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64270\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1977651289\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64270\" data-attachment-id=\"64270\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/d-loading/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1433766914\",\"copyright\":\"Los Angeles Lakers\",\"focal_length\":\"165\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"d loading\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64270\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?resize=308%2C205\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of nba.com\" width=\"308\" height=\"205\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64270\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of nba.com</p></div>\n<p>Not even recruited by his own hometown college of Kentucky, Russell made the most of his opportunity as the lone star at Ohio State. The only Buckeye to enter this year’s draft, the Lakers’ No. 2 overall pick should not come off as a surprise.</p>\n<p>With Kobe Bryant entering what many expect to be his last season, the Lakers are hoping to win now with a team that is currently in the process of rebuilding. Drafting Russell gives Los Angeles some hope in ensuring that the Laker dynasty will not plummet to rock bottom as he entered the NBA Draft as the player with the most superstar potential. Not to mention, his outright claim of being the “best player” in this year’s draft is encouraging for a Laker team that, according to Mr. Bryant himself during a scrimmage last season, was “soft as Charmin.”</p>\n<p>For all my analytics seekers out there, Russell is one of three freshman (Danny Ainge and Kenny Anderson) in NCAA college basketball history to average 19 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game. While there are some complaints floating around about the lefty’s athleticism, Lakers’ fans should be proud of their front office for selecting Russell. Not only is Russell a talented player, but the opportunity to learn from a champion veteran such as Bryant is very valuable. Considering this upcoming season will likely be Kobe’s last, who knows? Maybe the “Mamba” and Russell are a good enough backcourt to help the “LakeShow” get back to its winning ways.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>SAM DEKKER, SF- HOUSTON ROCKETS (WISCONSIN)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64271\" style=\"width: 372px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1005530131\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64271\" data-attachment-id=\"64271\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/dekker/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?fit=540%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"540,380\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dekker\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?fit=540%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64271\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?resize=362%2C255\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of usatoday.com\" width=\"362\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of usatoday.com</p></div>\n<p>Despite a disappointing 12 point performance in the Final Four Championship game in which he shot 0 for 6 from behind the three point line, Dekker is a solid addition for the Houston Rockets. During the regular season, Houston led the NBA in three-point field goals made at 11.4 per game and attempted at 32.7. However, the Rockets’ field goal percentage from downtown suffered as they shot 34.8 percent from behind the arc. With a streaky player such as James Harden taking a majority of these three-point attempts, not being able to fully depend on players like the aging Jason Terry, Trevor Ariza, and Corey Brewer can be troubling as seen in this year’s playoffs.</p>\n<p>Dekker is known for his “let it fly” shooting style and could become that go-to guy for the Rockets. Since the departure of Chandler Parsons, Houston has yet to find a legitimate scorer other than Harden. It’s obvious that Dekker must become more of a consistent scorer in order to be effective in the Rockets’ rotation. Houston must utilize Dekker as more than a spot up three-point shooter – he has the size to put the ball on the hardwood and get to the paint.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>FRANK KAMINSKY, C- CHARLOTTE HORNETS (WISCONSIN)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64272\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"306464614\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64272\" data-attachment-id=\"64272\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/kaminsky_3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?fit=960%2C1526&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,1526\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"KAMINSKY_3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?fit=157%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?fit=644%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64272\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?resize=190%2C302\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of charlotteobserver.com\" width=\"190\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?resize=157%2C250&amp;ssl=1 157w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?resize=644%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 644w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64272\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of charlotteobserver.com</p></div>\n<p>They say “slow and steady wins the race,” but in today’s basketball world the one and done movement has revamped the sport of college basketball. However, Kaminsky is the prime example of a player that stayed committed to developing through a four-year process. But, it wasn’t until his junior year that “Frank the Tank” became a prominent name in the Wisconsin basketball program. His freshman and sophomore years resulted in nearly 10 minutes of play and 5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Helping lead Wisconsin to its second consecutive Final Four appearance, Kaminsky’s senior year was the best season of his collegiate career. He was the only player in Division I basketball this season to average at least 17 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game. Kaminsky had such an outstanding year that he became the first player in Wisconsin history to win the National Player of the Year award. Charlotte’s addition of Kaminsky to its depth chart finally gives the Hornets a big that can stretch the floor, which could create more scoring opportunities for point guard Kemba Walker. While center Al Jefferson is capable of posting up on the block or knocking down some 15 to 20 feet jump shots, he does not possess the same shooting range to spread the floor like Kaminsky. Not given much credit for his niftiness when driving the ball, Kaminsky has the potential to be a stretch four as a duo with Jefferson.</p>\n<p>We all know Kaminsky has the full package, but he will need to increase his strength and build upon his frame to become more of a force in the paint. Regardless if he makes it into Charlotte’s starting lineup, Kaminsky will definitely improve the team’s offensive play as the Hornets ranked 28<sup>th</sup> out of all 30 NBA teams in offensive efficiency at 97.6 points per 100 possessions.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>DEVIN BOOKER, SG- PHOENIX SUNS (KENTUCKY)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64273\" style=\"width: 291px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1946479072\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64273\" data-attachment-id=\"64273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/dbook/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?fit=715%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"715,447\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dbook\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?fit=715%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64273\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?resize=281%2C176\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of kentuckysportsradio.com\" width=\"281\" height=\"176\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?w=715&amp;ssl=1 715w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of kentuckysportsradio.com</p></div>\n<p>Considered as the best shooter in this year’s draft, Booker has a lot to offer but did not have the opportunity to showcase his full range of talent as a Wildcat. While at Kentucky, Booker’s role as sixth man was to come into games and be a spot up three-point shooter. In a year in which he averaged 10 points per game, Booker earned SEC Sixth Man of the Year honors and was elected to both the All-SEC Freshman Team and All-SEC Second Team.</p>\n<p>Many have compared Booker to Golden State shooting guard Klay Thompson. Both share pretty similar body structures concerning height and weight, but Booker also faces the same concern as when Thompson entered the league. While we all know he can shoot the ball, the Suns’ are hoping that they can make Booker more of an offensive threat by expanding his driving abilities. While guards Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe are the primary leaders of Phoenix’s scoring, the Suns should be able to find a way to implement Booker into their gameplan.</p>\n<p>Of course there are other draftees that could have made this Top 5 list, but when forming this class of players there is more than talent being evaluated. In addition to skill and athleticism, players assumed to have an immediate impact were chosen. Since centers Karl-Anthony Towns and Jahlil Okafor were two of the most hyped picks in this draft, placing them on this list was avoided.</p>\n<p>Regardless if the players selected to this list are busts or stars in the NBA, only time can tell. Even if some fans are not satisfied with their team’s selection, at least we can all appreciate that each year we are watching a generation of basketball players that are rejuvenating the game of professional basketball through the draft.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

If so, Tate will become the first Gaucho in UCSB history to be drafted in the first-round.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Women’s Athlete of the Year: Katie Records (Women’s Swim)</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an exciting season for the UCSB Women’s Swimming team, Katie Records once again led the show and made a name for herself all year. Records received two MPSF Athlete of the Week honors, countless first place victories in her various races, and now is ranked within the Gauchos’ school record books for both singles and relay events. She finished her season with three individual 1st place victories at the MPSF Championships, earning her team 60 points on her own. This tied for the most points by any single athlete and was enough to help UCSB take 3rd place in the Championship meet.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Men’s Team of the Year: Men’s Tennis</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB men’s soccer returned to form this past season with a Big West regular season title and made it all the way to the second round of the NCAA tournament. Santa Barbara had a total of 12 wins on the season, making it the 13th straight year the program has accomplished double-digit wins for a season. The highlights of the team’s year include a 2-0 win against rival Cal Poly on national television and nine players selected to the All-Big West Team.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Women’s Team of the Year: Women’s Tennis</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Representing the ladies, Women’s Tennis takes the cake for Team of the Year, completing the sweep for UCSB tennis. Going 8-3 in conference, the Gauchos finished in second place in the Big West and reached national rankings as high as No. 50. Like the men’s team, the women found some momentum in the second half of the season posting an 11-2 record to close out the year that took it all the way to the final round of the Big West Tournament. Several players were awarded to Big West teams in both singles and doubles, as well as a few honorable mentions.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Coach of the Year: Andrew Checketts (Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Head Coach Andrew Checketts’ devotion to his squad is what paved the way for UCSB baseball’s 40-win season this year. His dedication to make the players and program the best it can be has caught the eye of many within collegiate baseball. Not only did he lead the team to host its first NCAA Regional, but his bid to install new stadium lighting continues his goals of helping UCSB baseball gradually progress as a program. It’s without a doubt that Coach Checketts’ contributions to the UCSB baseball program are unmatched.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Freshmen of the Year: Gabe Vincent (M Basketball), Lou Adler (W Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When Head Coach Bob Williams saw Gabe Vincent play before he committed to UCSB, he knew right away that the freshman recruit would be the Gauchos starting shooting guard. Surely enough, Vincent did not disappoint as he earned Big West Freshman of the Year and was one of four players to average double-digits in scoring with 10.1 points per game. Throughout the season, he showed his ability to take over the game and deliver in the clutch with a game-tying three pointer against Southern Methodist and a game-winning bucket versus Hawaii. With Alan Williams gone, Vincent looks to be the program’s future.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Coming to Santa Barbara, California from her hometown of Vaucresson, France, freshman Lou Adler has had a successful adventure in her first year at UCSB. Despite a mid-season injury, Adler was still able to break into national rankings at No. 93 and end the season on a three-match win streak. She played all of her matches this year for the Gauchos on the number-one ranked court and helped them to a phenomenal season that saw them reach the Big West Tournament Final.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Senior Standouts: Alan Williams (M Basketball), Shelby Wisdom (Softball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite being limited by a shoulder injury for a chunk of the conference season, Alan “Big Al” Williams still managed to be the most dominant big man in the Big West. Big Al earned his third straight Big West First-Team honor and became UCSB’s all-time leader in rebounds along the way. The double-double machine averaged 17.3 points per game and 11.8 rebounds, but it was his tenacity on defense and passing from the post that really separated him from other centers in the country. Big Al’s legendary career as a Gaucho may lead to his name being called in the 2015 NBA Draft on June 25.</p>\n<p>While an injury prevented senior Shelby Wisdom from wreaking havoc on the mound this past season, her UCSB career ends with an undoubtedly remarkable finish. She will leave Santa Barbara with the honors of being named to an All-Conference team in all four of her seasons and ranks within the top-10 of six different statisitcal categories in the Gauchos’ record books. The 2014 season was another milestone filled year as she hit a career-high .304 batting average and became the fourth player in UCSB softball history to hit 10 homeruns in a single season.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Game of the Year: 2/7/15 Men’s Basketball Defeats Hawaii 75-74</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">UCSB trailed by as many as 13 points against Hawaii, but down with five minutes left, the Gauchos hit four straight three pointers to take its first lead of the half. Holding on to a one-point lead with just seconds left, freshman guard Gabe Vincent hit a fade away jump shot to extend UCSB’s lead. Hawaii managed to tie the game with a second left, but upon review, Hawaii’s made three point shot was ruled only a two pointer, giving Santa Barbara a 75-74 comeback win in front of 4,383 fans in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Most Memorable Moment: DePuy Game-Winner (Men’s Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Of midfielder Nick DePuy’s six game-winners this past season, perhaps none was more memorable than his first. With under a minute to go in a 0-0 draw against No. 3 UC Irvine at Harder Stadium, DePuy blasted in an incredible goal from 35-yards out to seal the win and get UCSB off to a perfect 2-0 start in conference play. The goal came in his first start of the season at forward – a position he would remain at for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Story: Andy Perez Loses Redshirt for Injury-Plagued Gauchos (Men’s Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Before the beginning of the 2014 season, midfielder Andy Perez agreed to redshirt for his sophomore year, planning to develop his game more before using up another year of eligibility. However, numerous injuries along with a four-game winless streak had the Gauchos in fear of missing out on the Big West Tournament altogether. With just five games left in the season, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg turned to Perez to fill the void in a vacant midfield, believing that he could be the spark to lift the team to a Big West title. In his first game against Sac St. and in what he called “one of the coolest moments of [his] life,” Perez scored the opening goal, the first in his NCAA career, sparking a run in which UCSB went 3-0-1 to close the season and finish with the best conference record in the Big West.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Breakout Season: Nick DePuy (Men’s Soccer), Cameron Newell (Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nick DePuy didn’t start the year as one of UCSB’s primary offensive targets, but after making the move to forward midway through the season, he quickly proved that he probably should have been there a long time ago. The near-unstoppable forward notched a team-high 10 goals, including an insane six game-winners to lead his team to a No. 1 seed in the Big West Tournament. His performances earned him the honors of Big West Offensive Player of the Year and a pair of National Player of the Week awards.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While many may not have expected his emergence, senior outfielder Cameron Newell led Big West leaderboards all season with a career-best, .368 batting average. He nearly doubled his total hits from last season and hit the only three homers of his Gaucho career during this past season. Newell also became the first Gaucho in team history to win the Big West Field Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Interview: Nathan Eshmade (Men’s Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nathan Eshmade had been on a hot streak at home and had just taken wins in both singles and doubles to secure his team’s victory at a home match that was hosted by a sorority. On being asked if he feeds off of the energy of the home crowd, the Aussie native had this to say. “The crowds are great. I mean you got all these pretty girls out here, calling out to you, so you gotta look at them like, “YEAH!! I just won that point!,” and they yell back and you keep going off of the energy and that really helps us.”</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Looking: Josh Smith (M Swim), Savannah Francis (W Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A member of UCSB’s men’s swimming backstroke unit, junior Josh Smith has earned himself a charming honor. While he has had a great impact on the team with his performance in the pool, Smith’s achievements outside of swimming are impressive as well. He was selected as one of 160 participants to receive an internship at the Cannes Film Festival in France.</p>\n<p>Even when suited up in her women’s soccer uniform, junior defender/forward Savannah Francis is the other enchanting Gaucho to earn this award. Starting in 16 of the Gauchos’ 19 games, Smith ended the year with a total of two goals and one assist.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Most Badass: Morgan Mays (Men’s Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For those of you who wouldn’t think that a tennis player should deserve this award, you have not met Morgan Mays and luckily will probably never have to step foot on a court with him. For if you did, you would be first faced with a 120 MPH serve coming over the net at full force. And, if you were at all blessed to lay your strings on it, you would be faced with an even more deadly line-drive return powered by his aggressive baseliner style. Mays is a Bulldog and he will let you know when he barks at you following every point he slams in your face and onto the concrete. With the thunder that he brings to the court every match, there is no question why the man called “The Beast” is this year’s winner for Most Badass.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A version of this article appeared on pages 10 and 11 of June 4, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/","id":3258,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3257,3256,3255],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":100,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
