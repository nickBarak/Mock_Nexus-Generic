Defeating Missouri Saturday evening was the one bright spot in the Gauchos’ weekend, eking out a 6-5 victory before concluding the tournament on Sunday with losses to Washington and Arizona State by scores of 10-2 and 8-0 respectively.</p>\n<p>A beautiful afternoon in Palm Springs was the backdrop for the toughest loss of the weekend for the Gauchos, a game in which they lead or shared the lead until the bottom of the sixth inning. Veronika Gulvin started and went the full six innings for UCSB, a decent effort for the sophomore who surrendered four earned runs and finished with a hefty WHIP of 2.00.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Oklahoma Head Coach Kenny Gajewski took out his sophomore starting pitcher Barbie Biggerstaff midway through the first frame, replacing her with junior Whitney Whitehorn, who would go on to toss four-and-a-third scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>After a pair of walks in the top of the fourth, the Gauchos were able to break a 2-2 tie during an odd sequence of events that included freshman infielder Kayla Krantz striking out, freshman catcher Kaitlin Barry getting thrown out at second base and Genesis Ramirez, another freshman infielder, still coming in to score from third.</p>\n<p>Two runs on a trio of Cowboy singles was the nail in the coffin for UCSB. However, as freshman Logan Simunek — who relieved Whitehorn in the sixth inning — forced a ground out, pop out and strike out to end what would be the Gauchos’ closest loss of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega took the mound to face the Volunteers Thursday night, and though she was able to accomplish the second complete game by a Gaucho pitcher on the day, her eight runs allowed (six earned) — especially the final five, which all came in the fourth inning or later — proved to be all Tennessee needed to pull out an 8-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz was the star of the game for the Gauchos, going 2-3 with all three of UCSB’s RBI, including a first-inning, two-run blast over the left field wall. Tennessee’s junior shortstop Meghan Gregg was there to outdo her, though, batting 2-4 with a home run, double and four RBI on the evening.</p>\n<p>Tennessee sophomore Matty Moss improved her record to 6-0 on the season (half of the Volunteers’ wins after Thursday’s contest), throwing all seven innings, striking out 10 batters and allowing only five hits and no walks.</p>\n<p>UCSB played another tough one against Purdue Friday, in which a neck-and-neck game was blown open in the top of the fifth with a flurry of Boilermaker scores. The four-run outbreak, centered on a bases-loaded double by junior catcher Kaylah Hampton, all but guaranteed the Gauchos’ third loss to start the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Boilermakers’ inferior record (this victory was only their second of the season), made this loss particularly painful for the Gauchos, especially since their bats were just beginning to come to life.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer rocked a second-inning solo home run, while Diaz was able to accumulate a double and an RBI for the second-straight game. Junior right fielder Jessica Johnston also grabbed a double of her own, and redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton hit home a baserunner for only the fourth time this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally got a positive result Saturday night, earning victory in a miraculous, comeback fashion. Down three entering the seventh and final inning, two of the first three Gaucho batters were retired on infield groundouts, but senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos was able to make her way on base after being hit by a pitch.</p>\n<p>With two outs on the scoreboard, the magic began. Jessica Johnston singled, advancing Cavazos to third, and after a ball hit to left field by Diaz, both went on to score on an error by sophomore Raime Cohen, who’d just subbed in to begin the inning.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer came to the plate with the Gauchos down two and Diaz on second base. With the game on the line, she crushed a pitch from sophomore Danielle Baumgartner into the left-field bleachers, finally assuring the Gauchos their first victory of the weekend. The two-run shot was Altmeyer’s second of the day and third in the past two games, though surprisingly those are her only three of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB lost in five innings in both of its Sunday matchups, falling 10-2 to the Washington Huskies and 8-0 to the Arizona State Sun Devils.</p>\n<p>Noriega couldn’t make it through the first inning of the Washington game, forcing the Gauchos to look past Noriega and Gulvin to freshman Lilliana Rodriguez and junior Lena Mayer, UCSB’s two lightly used pitchers. The duo surrendered nine runs (eight earned) in just three and a third innings.</p>\n<p>Gulvin was back to start the Arizona State game, but after allowing a two-run home run and hitting a batter in the second frame, the ball was again handed to Noriega, who went on to let in five more runs. She finished the next three innings, but the Gauchos’ complete inability to generate any offense sealed their fate and concluded a disappointing weekend for UCSB.</p>\n<p>While there have been glimpses of power hitting, consistent play and strong pitching for the Gauchos, this team has a long way to go if they are to climb back to the .500 mark and make 2017 a winning season. The team cannot continue to allow opponents such drastic, early leads, and the lineup must start generating more extra-base hits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope March has clearer skies in store, and will begin their climb back to success against Utah Valley, Iowa State, Nevada, Southern Utah and Nebraska Omaha next weekend at the St. George Red Desert Classic.</p><div

Despite having some solid performances, Tulane is now 1-6 to start the year and is now losers of six straight ball games.</p>\n<p>Each game this weekend had a different story, but all had the same outcome: a gaucho victory. Sunday’s match was certainly the most entertaining of the three as the game came down to the wire with UCSB delivering the knockout punch in the bottom of the ninth inning courtesy of sophomore catcher Thomas Rowan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The scoring began early as in the first inning, the Green Wave had pitcher Joe Record on his heels as a RBI single from senior outfielder Jarret DeHart made the game 1-0. Record then proceeded to give up a double and hit the next batter to be faced with bases loaded situation with two outs. Like a veteran, the redshirt sophomore avoided getting into more trouble by striking out the next batter. Record finished the game after four innings, allowing eight hits, with three earned runs and five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>In the very next inning, senior infielder Hunter Hope gave his team a 2-0 advantage after homering to left field on a solo shot, his second of the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would respond in the bottom of the third inning after they began the inning with a walk, and a single to have the runners on first and second. Junior shortstop Clay Fisher continued his brilliant start to the season by knocking in a run with a single. After a strikeout, junior first baseman Austin Bush lined out to left field scoring another run to tie the game at two.</p>\n<p>After getting two very easy outs early in the fourth inning, Record looked as though he would be unhittable for the rest of the match. However, the Green Wave hit him with a two-out rally after sophomore right fielder Grant Witherspoon knocked a double scoring a runner from first.</p>\n<p>Witherspoon was one of the brightest spots for Tulane this weekend as he went 8-13 on the weekend with three runs and one RBI. Senior Hunter Williams scored his sophomore counterpart in the next at-bat so Tulane could take a 4-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The game eventually became tied at four after the Gauchos score one run in the fourth and sixth inning. In the ninth, it looked as though Tulane would salvage a game from UCSB after taking a one-run lead after a ball got passed, Rowan. Before that, junior Colton Burns misplayed a ball in the left field near the foul line which allowed the game-leading run to take third and subsequently score.</p>\n<p>Despite that, UCSB fought back in the bottom half of the final inning. Senior utility Billy Fredrick was called up to pinch hit began the inning with a single. After a Fisher, bunt turned error allowing him to take first, and a Cohen walk, the Gauchos had the bases loaded with no outs.</p>\n<p>Bush came in and delivered the game-tying run with a single to left field setting the stage for Rowan to be the hero. After an earlier mistake in the top half of the inning, the sophomore catcher made amends with a straight shot single down the middle gap bringing in a run and giving his team the sweep.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s win was truly a great way to end the series, but the victory on Saturday was certainly just as sweet as behind two home runs from Cohen, UCSB trounced Tulane 14-1 to get back to .500 on the year.</p>\n<p>The game certainly looked to be decided early as the Gauchos put forth a three-run first inning, followed by a four-run second inning to take a commanding 7-0 lead after two complete.</p>\n<p>In the first, Cohen accounted for all three scores after blasting a three-run shot to right field. In the second, Fredrick knocked in two runs with a single followed by teammate redshirt sophomore Tommy Jew knocking in two more as well. Fredrick finished the day with an impressive 3-3 outing with four RBI’s and three runs. Bush, who had been struggling previously, also had a big day, finishing the day 3-4 with two RBI’s and a solo home run.</p>\n<p>In the pitching department, junior Kyle Nelson (1-1) had a tremendous second outing throwing five full innings allowing only two hits, one earned run while striking out four. Being known primarily as a reliever in the past, the Gauchos hope that his stamina continues building steadily so he can continue this dominant run.</p>\n<p>Setting the stage for a tremendous weekend, the Gauchos were able to put a stop to their three-game losing skid on Friday with a beautiful 7-4 victory as they jumped out to the early lead and kept a strangle on it until the end.</p>\n<p>Both teams were scoreless through two, but UCSB began the scoring in the bottom third with a three-run frame courtesy of Fredrick’s RBI single, and Cohen’s two-run single.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth, Santa Barbara kept applying the pressure scoring four more runs courtesy of a redshirt junior utility Kenny Corey’s RBI double to left center, a wild pitch, and two walks on bases loaded situation.</p>\n<p>Tulane scored two runs in the top of the fifth, but never got enough offensive firepower going to truly make a comeback giving the Gauchos their first win of the season at home.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend was a solid one for the ‘Chos. They were able to sustain both offensive and pitching power throughout the weekend and got three quality wins over a team that has solid talent. Sunday’s win, in particular, proved that this Gaucho team has the capability to do what it did last year, win close games.</p>\n<p>Last year, UCSB was 17-4 in one-run games. Being able to sneak a victory is nothing short of spectacular, and this is something Santa Barbara will need to continue doing as the year progresses.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game will be against St. Mary’s on Tuesday at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Zaloumis is the team leader in both average (.471) and RBI (7), but he does not hit in the typical spot for someone with team-leading offensive numbers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gael third baseman has been hitting eighth in the line-up for the Gaels and, interestingly enough, has been producing in that eighth spot. There may be a possibility that Saint Mary’s Head Coach Eric Valenzuela will move Zaloumis in the line-up, but as the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</p>\n<p>The expected starters for Tuesday’s matchup are UCSB’s sophomore RHP Noah Davis (2-0) and Saint Mary’s senior RHP Cameron Neff (0-0). Last time out, Gaucho ace Davis was spectacular against the Tulane Green Wave, going seven innings, striking out 10 and giving up only two earned runs while earning his second win of the season.</p>\n<p>Neff’s last outing was a completely different story, as Neff went five innings, giving up four earned runs off nine hits against the Huskies. With the Gauchos collecting 35 hits and scoring 27 runs this past weekend, it will be very interesting to see how Neff and the rest of the Saint Mary’s pitching staff will fare against the surging Gaucho offense.</p>\n<p>Continuing with the now very dangerous Gaucho offense, three bats awoke for the Gauchos against Tulane, who will be key factors heading into Tuesday’s contest. The senior outfielder and DH Billy Fredrick had a huge series against the Green Wave, hitting .714 (5 for 7) with four runs and five RBI. Redshirt junior third baseman Kenny Corey also had himself a great few games, going 5 for 9 (.556) with three runs and three RBI.</p>\n<p>However, the most important bat this weekend was that of junior first baseman Austin Bush. Bush, who headed into the Tulane series one for his last 15, found his swing, hitting .545 (6 for 11) with one home run and four RBI. If the lefty can continue his opposite-field approach into Tuesday’s game, Bush will to continue to find good barrel on the ball.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Colton Burns also continues to rip the ball for the Gauchos, hitting .476 this season. Burns, who also had himself a series against Tulane (5 for 8, 7 runs), will be a problem for the Gaels if he continues to get on base. Through 31 plate appearances, the junior transfer from College of Canyons has a mind-blowing on-base percentage of .645 and scored a team-leading eight times this season. Paired with his .667 slugging percent, Burns is a very early leader for team MVP.</p>\n<p>After a comeback ninth-inning walk-off win Sunday afternoon to get the sweep against Tulane, the Gauchos have all the momentum in the world for the Saint Mary’s matchup. Still, this one game appearance by the Saint Mary’s Gaels will prove to be yet another test for the Gauchos.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76031\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76031\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/","id":4142,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

When faced with adversity he did not find excuses but instead found ways to succeed and win.</p>\n<p>Gaucho alum Bill Geivett recently released his book<em>, Do You Want to Work in Baseball? Inside Baseball Operations,</em> which details his experiences in professional baseball as a player, scout, farm director and front-office executive. In the publication, Geivett’s advice is not only applicable to those who seek a career in sports management, but to anyone competing in any type of job market today as well.</p>\n<p>Geivett played for the Gauchos in 1984 and 1985 and posted monster numbers while in a UCSB uniform. Geivett still holds the school records for career batting average (.402), single season batting average (.412, 1985), hits in a season (100, 1985). He also used to hold records for triples in a season (8, 1985), most runs scored in a season (74, 1985), and most at-bats in a single season (243, 1985).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After previously being drafted four consecutive times by four different organizations, Geivett finally signed with then Anaheim Angels organization in 1985 after being drafted in the 13th round.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Geivett, his baseball-playing career would come to a sudden conclusion due to a knee injury in 1988, but this career ending injury still would not stop Geivett from being a part of baseball. Soon after, Geivett would coach for Loyola Marymount University in 1989 and Long Beach State University in 1990.</p>\n<p>While coaching for college programs added to his already impressive baseball resume, Geivett’s future would still lie in professional baseball with him eventually becoming a scout and instructor in the Yankees organization in 1991.</p>\n<p>From 1994 to 1996, Geivett would be hired as the head farm director for the Montreal Expos. The Expos’ farm system was largely known as one of the best farm systems in baseball during this time due to the tremendous talent in the system that housed big names such as Mark Grudzielanek, Orlando Cabrera, Jose Vidro, Cliff Floyd and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>\n<p>During his time as a farm director, in his book, Geivett recalls an experience he had with a particular player, F.P. Santangelo.</p>\n<p>Jeff Blair from the <em>Montreal Gazette</em> published an article with an inside major league source from the Expos’ organization, stating, “We don’t feel there is anyone in Ottawa [Montreal’s Triple-A affiliate] who can help our team in Montreal.”</p>\n<p>This angered many Ottawa Lynx players, but no more so than it angered Santangelo. After a team meeting, most players had cooled down — but not Santangelo. Santangelo would confront Geivett and insist he is ready to be called up to the big leagues, even though Santangelo was hitting a less than impressive .243 at the time.</p>\n<p>After a roster spot opened up on the big league squad due to an injury, Geivett would take a risk on Santangelo, sending him to the big leagues after Santangelo waited seven years in the minors. Stating he went above several people’s heads in the organization to do this in his memoir, Geivett’s career was on the line with this decision.</p>\n<p>Nervous, Geivett’s worst fear would come true and Santangelo’s name would be penciled in the lineup the first day he arrived in Montreal. Putting all his money on Santangelo, a person who was more confident in his ability than anyone, Geivett would come out on top.</p>\n<p>Santangelo would go on to hit a triple that night and would end up staying in the big leagues for seven years. Geivett stated in his book himself, “It was one of my most emotional experiences in professional baseball watching F.P. slide into third base … F.P. Santangelo taught me the power of confidence.”</p>\n<p>After his time in Montreal, Geivett would become the assistant general manager of the Devil Rays in 1997 and would move on to join the Dodgers in 1998 under the same position.</p>\n<p>While with the Dodgers, Geivett shared another story about college graduates looking for work in professional baseball. At the Baseball Winter Meetings, an event where baseball GMs meet and discuss potential trades, a couple college graduates approached Geivett and Tommy Lasorda with their resumes trying to get hired on the spot for jobs within the organization. Right then and there, both Geivett and Lasorda broke down the flaws in each approach the men had … to their faces.</p>\n<p>When asked about this story when speaking as a special guest for a sports management course here at UCSB, Geivett assured the class to do these three specific things that are reinforced and expanded upon in his book: “Have a specialty.

Now 5-9, 2-7, UCSD’s solid run has landed it just outside the top 15 schools in the country, receiving six votes in the latest NCAA rankings poll.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s losing streak started on Jan. 25 with a 3-0 loss to UCLA, then the second-ranked team in the nation. Another loss at the hands of the Bruins combined with two tough defeats in Honolulu to Hawaii, who is now ranked fourth, turned the slide into a losing streak. Losses to current No. 10 Pepperdine, No. 8 Stanford and No. 2 Long Beach State were what pushed the streak to seven games.</p>\n<p>Losses to current No. 10 Pepperdine, No. 8 Stanford and No. 2 Long Beach State were what pushed the streak to seven games.</p>\n<p>UCSD isn’t ranked at all, so Friday’s game will certainly be a break from the norm for the Gauchos. However, that does not mean it will be an easy matchup.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite hitter Tanner Syftestad leads the Triton attack, a major change from when UCSD visited Santa Barbara. The 6-8 junior has double-digit kills in all but two games since he and his team faced the Gauchos, and his rate of 4.23 kills per set is fifth in the nation.</p>\n<p>Syftestad’s 26 kills were the key to UCSD’s upset of USC earlier this year, and he’ll look to possibly replicate such a performance against the Gauchos on Friday.</p>\n<p>Setter Milosh Stojcic has been similarly excellent for the Tritons and just as important. The UCSD attack flows through Stojcic, who has a team-high 464 assists, and the junior has been balanced on the defensive end with solid 50 digs to go with his offensive contributions.</p>\n<p>In order to defeat the Tritons, UCSB will have to key in on the two impact players but also get its own attack figured out. Long Beach State held the Gauchos to a season-low 28 kills in UCSB’s last contest.</p>\n<p>It was star redshirt senior outside hitter Jacob Delson’s first game this season without double-digit kills and the first game he didn’t lead the Gauchos in kills. Friday presents the first opportunity for Delson to shake that rough performance off and get back to his elite attacking ways.</p>\n<p>Aside from his recent layoff, Delson has been a consistent force for UCSB all season as he leads the Gauchos in both kills and kills per set at 221 and 4.25, respectively.</p>\n<p>A strong service game in UCSB’s first matchup with UCSD proved crucial in that first win, but recent matches have seen the Gauchos struggle to receive and send service consistently.</p>\n<p>A return to form in that area would go a long way in ensuring the Gauchos snap their streak and sweep the Tritons.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UCSD Friday, Feb. 24 at 7 p.m. in San Diego.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75931\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-24/ucsb-looks-to-serve-uc-san-diego-break-seven-game-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75931\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-24/ucsb-looks-to-serve-uc-san-diego-break-seven-game-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-24/ucsb-looks-to-serve-uc-san-diego-break-seven-game-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-24/ucsb-looks-to-serve-uc-san-diego-break-seven-game-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-24/ucsb-looks-to-serve-uc-san-diego-break-seven-game-losing-streak/","id":4972,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4971,4970,4969],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope To Take Women’s Soccer Program  To Another Level With New 2017 Recruting Class","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-16-16_8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-16-16_8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was a productive offseason for the UCSB women's soccer program as it looks to overcome another deflating finish despite a historic start to its 2016 campaign.

The Los Angeles native was in the Summer Pool, Winter Pool and Region IV Championships for four years from 2012-2015. As a member of her high school team, she was named the conference’s MVP in her sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>Another newcomer who hopes to see playing time during her freshman year is forward Belinda Ascencio as she helped lead her club team to a state championship. She also excelled on her high school team as well earning her conference’s MVP honors in both her freshman and sophomore years. The Calif. native scored 39 goals and had 11 assists in 20 matches during her first year. Fellow forward Courtney Chan is another offensive player to watch out for as she is another multiple letter-winner after being named a First Team All-Santa Clara Valley Athletic League selection three times.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos were able to add three defenders, but one who certainly sticks out is Maya Nielan, who stands at an impressive 5’9” stature, tying her for tallest on the team. The Danville, Calif. native was on the U-14 national team and currently ranks in the Top 100 on <em>topdrawersoccer.com</em>.</p>\n<p>Amaya Zabalza will also look to excel on the team as she was a member of the Force squad that won the 2013 U14 National Championship. The defender has won countless championships with different teams and has received countless awards honors, including three time All-CIF CCS selection.</p>\n<p>In total, the Gauchos were able to tally six midfielders, three defenders and two forwards, and all of them look to help the team grow and possibly bring back a conference championship back to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Aggies have won six consecutive games as their 19-6, 10-2 record matches their finish from last season.</p>\n<p>Holding a one-game lead for first place over Long Beach State, which is responsible for its two conference losses, UC Davis will play Cal Poly before hosting UCSB in its final home game of the year. If UCD manages to win its seventh straight, it would tie the longest streak in the program’s Division I history set back in both 2008 and 2010.</p>\n<p>The path to upsetting the Aggies will begin with the Gauchos’ ability to protect the ball. UCSB is coming off a season-high 26 turnovers in its loss to Long Beach State, in which it was outscored 35-13 in points off turnovers. It was the sixth time this season the Gauchos turned the ball over 20-plus times, but the first since Dec. 19 in their win over Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.</p>\n<p>While the defensive pressure of opposing teams must be accredited, oftentimes UCSB’s turnover troubles result from self-inflicted mistakes such as forcing passes in the lane and paint that result in steals, wasted possessions that go out of bounds or the mishandling of passes.</p>\n<p>During the team’s 1-4 standing in its last five games, UCSB has continuously struggled with its three-point shooting. Over the span of games, Santa Barbara has accumulated a 21.4 average from behind three-point line, finishing with an 11.8 percentage in its last game after a 2-for-17 finish from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could use an improved three-point shooting performance from redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting a Big West fifth-best 39.2 percent from three-point land and having the third-most made three-pointers in the conference at 56, Porter has only shown glimpses of her once consistent long range shooting.</p>\n<p>She began the Gauchos’ five game slide with a disturbing zero points and 0-of-8 shooting outing and hasn’t been able to make much progress since. Currently shooting 25.6 percent from behind the perimeter, Porter has only managed to achieve double figures in scoring twice, and she is coming off her second-lowest career total of two points.</p>\n<p>Still, the team’s go-to scorer remains a primary option as her 56 made three-pointers are tied for sixth-most in a single season in UCSB women’s basketball history. If Porter can manage to get the three ball to fall, it could be very beneficial as the Gauchos are 6-1 during conference play when she makes three or more three-point baskets.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to capitalize upon any scoring opportunity it can get as it prepares to face arguably the most dynamic team in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UC Davis, who last won a Big West title in 2011, has made itself one of the conference’s few teams favored to lock up the No. 1 seed and possibly win the Big West Tournament. Another win could have major implications as the 2010-11 season also was UCD’s last 20-win season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies lead in just about every imaginable statistical category with outstanding averages in points per game (69.8), points allowed per game (60), field goal percentage (44.3), three-point percentage (35.3), defensive three-point percentage (27.5), defensive field goal percentage (35.3), turnovers committed per game (13.6) and assists per game (16.8).</p>\n<p>Davis is one of three Big West teams this season to hand UCSB its largest deficit in a loss of 14 points. The two teams last met on Feb. 4 when redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch tied her career-high of 27 points to lead the Aggies to a 62-48 victory.</p>\n<p>Bertsch currently ranks third in points per game and fourth in field goal percentage in the Big West with averages of 16.7 and 52.7, respectively. Three of her eight 20-point games this season have occurred in the Aggies’ past four games.</p>\n<p>As the team’s top scorer, Bertsch is able to score in the paint and stretch the floor with her midrange shooting, benefiting from behind the perimeter is the junior duo of forwards Pele Gianotti and Dani Nafekh.</p>\n<p>The pair of long range sharpshooters complete Davis’ trio of double figure scorers with Nafekh averaging 11.3 PPG and Gianotti at 10.6 PPG. Both are within the top five in the Big West in three-point percentage, as Nafekh sits atop the conference at 46.5 percent while Gianotti is sixth at 38.5 percent.</p>\n<p>UCSB held UC Davis to a 12.5 three-point percentage earlier in the month on 2-of-16 shooting.</p>\n<p>Upsetting the Aggies at home will be a difficult task as they have won 14 of their last 17 home games. Most notably, they have not trailed in a game since the second quarter of their win over Cal State Fullerton back on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Despite facing arguably the best team in the Big West, UCSB must focus on its defensive approach as that will help it produce on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip off at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25 at the Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75914\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75914\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/","id":251,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[250,249,248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Men’s Basketball Looking to Hold On to Slim Postseason Chance Entering Final Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently at the bottom of the Big West standings, the UCSB men's basketball team is on its last leg of hope to grab the eighth seed in the Big West tournament.

Not only has he scored the brunt of the Gaucho baskets since Vincent has been out, but he has played with a noticeable energy and fierceness to the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>In his most recent game against Long Beach State, he only put seven on the board, but before that he scored 16 points in the victory against Hawaii last Thursday and has been an essential asset to the team, starting the last five games averaging 12.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Despite only scoring four points, Gaucho freshman guard Christian Terrell had a solid game against LBSU as he tied his career-high grabbing nine rebounds. Although Terrell has had some hesitation in the past when it comes to taking the shot, he has started in six conference games so far and continues to improve.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Highlanders’ field goal percentage is 42.1 while the Gauchos are barely hanging onto their 37.1, a league-worst mark. An unfortunate recurring theme for the UCSB team is their inability to shoot with accuracy. The trouble is not getting to the basket but getting the ball in the basket.</p>\n<p>Aside from Hart and team leader senior guard Eric Childress, freshman guard Max Heidegger is an explosive player that drives hard and puts points on the board, yet with so many top players unable to participate, the Gauchos are suffering as clearly demonstrated in their record.</p>\n<p>One area that Santa Barbara does excel in, at least ever so slightly better than UCR, is rebounding. The Gauchos are averaging 36.6 per game compared to the Highlanders’ 34.8, showcasing how they are getting in there and grabbing the ball off both offensive and defensive glass.</p>\n<p>UCR has a fantastic free throw percentage of nearly 73 percent on the season compared to the Gaucho percentage of 64 percent. In their most recent game, UCSB had 17 personal fouls called on them; against a team as accurate as Riverside, the Gauchos will have to play smart and not commit as many fouls, especially on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>For Childress, Thursday will obviously be an emotional night as it will be his final game wearing a Gaucho uniform in the Thunderdome. The senior will look to cap off his home career in the right way improving upon his team-high 8.5 points per game, 3.5 assists per game and 2.2 steals per game, also a Big West best.</p>\n<p>The co-captain of the team alongside Vincent, Childress has played on some great Gaucho teams, and although this wasn’t the ending he expected, a win could mitigate some of the damage done to his senior season.</p>\n<p>As the season winds to a close, all teams are trying to bring in as many wins as possible heading into the Big West tournament. As this will be each team’s second to last game, expect both teams to bring all they have got to the court.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gaucho and UCR Highlander game will take place this Thursday, Feb. 23, in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/","id":248,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[247,246,245],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The ‘Boogie-Less’ Kings Leave Sacramento With No Hope, Franchise Remains in Declining State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sportsblog.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sportsblog.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Sacramento Kings' decision to trade arguably the best center in the league, Demarcus 'Boogie' Cousins, has left many people within their fan base with what seems like an unsolvable void.

He called it his “home” over and over, and he made it very clear he wanted to retire a King. He wanted his jersey in the rafters.</p>\n<p>Just watch his speech at his Sacramento farewell party on Monday night: he can barely stumble through a few sentences without being overwhelmed with tears. He cried more than I did when I left Sacramento, and I was leaving to go live in a dorm with two other guys. He’s leaving to go live in New Orleans and play with Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p>The Kings finally had a star player who loved Sacramento, and they traded him away. For nothing, I should add. Really, a return of Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, a mid-first round pick and a second round pick for one of the greatest Kings players of all time? That’s insulting.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s not surprising.</p>\n<p>It would have been more surprising had the Kings’ front office managed to get a fair return for Cousins. This is a team that drafted Jimmer Fredette over Klay Thompson and Thomas Robinson over Damian Lillard. They traded Isaiah Thomas, who is currently a top-five MVP candidate, for Alex Oriakhi, who is now a Mexican club league player.</p>\n<p>The last decade of Kings management has been a master class in sheer incompetence.</p>\n<p>So yeah, sure, Cousins never made it to the playoffs and only won more than 30 games once. I consider it half a miracle he even did that, saddled with this front office. Cousins had approximately five halfway decent teammates during his Kings career —Thomas, Evans, Rudy Gay, Darren Collison and Jason Thompson — and never more than three at any one time. LeBron James would struggle to bring teams like Cousins’s to the playoffs.</p>\n<p>I can’t deny the fact that Cousins was a lot — sometimes too much — to handle as a teammate and a player. He pouted, whined and fought with referees, teammates and coaches. But when you added it all up, his offensive dominance and love for Sacramento outweighed the negatives, plentiful as they were.</p>\n<p>Cousins’s brilliance and loyalty were some of the only on-court bright spots in the last decade of Kings basketball. As long as the Kings had Cousins, Sacramento had something to hope for. He was evidence that sometimes the front office could succeed in spite of itself.</p>\n<p>That’s gone now. In the end, not even Cousins could end the torture and escape the incompetence of the Kings. No wonder my brother chose to be a Warriors fan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/","id":1897,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[1896,1895,1894],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Await Barbara Kalbus Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering the weekend with a current two-game win streak, the UCSB women's water polo team will look to extend its streak over the course of the three-day invitational.

Both games have been low scoring defensive battles as UCSB has only scored six goals in their two games against Michigan.</p>\n<p>After only giving up 6.5 goals per game at the Triton Invitational, the Gauchos look primed for revenge in what should be another defensive clash.</p>\n<p>Michigan come at you in many ways as they have five players who have scored over 17 goals this season. UCSB has two such players and has played one less game than Michigan this year.<br>\nA win against Michigan would mean the Gauchos would automatically finish in the top eight at the UCI Invitational. If they lose to Michigan and win the rest of their games, they would finish in ninth place.</p>\n<p>Depending on the result versus Michigan, UCSB will either play Stanford or Cal State Northridge early on Saturday.</p>\n<p>If they win, they would have a good chance of playing Stanford, the top team in the nation, who is undefeated.</p>\n<p>They have truly been dominant this season, only conceding four goals per game while scoring 16 goals per game. In fact, Stanford has never trailed at any point in any game this season.</p>\n<p>The other matchup possibility would be UCSB versus CSUN. Santa Barbara beat CSUN recently at the Triton Invitational 11-6. The Gauchos controlled that game and were the better side throughout the four quarters of play.</p>\n<p>A successful outcome at the UCI Invitational would launch this young team in the right direction as Big West play approaches. In the meantime, the Gauchos are still trying to get better every day.</p>\n<p>“It’s midseason, so right now we’re just trying to get better at the things we have been working on, and then we’ll add to that come conference time,” Kay said. “Right now it’s still defense, counter attack and just kind of the fundamentals.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior utility Miranda Schrader had surgery over the summer and was selected as one of the UCSB performance lifestyle athletes of the week for her hard work in returning to the pool.</p>\n<p>“[Schrader] is fully cleared to play, so it’ll be nice to have her back in the water and have her fill that southpaw role,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>Schrader’s experience and effectiveness will be needed for the Gauchos to make a run in the latter part of this season.</p>\n<p>Another player who is essential to the team’s success is senior utility Taylor Shore, who is putting together another outstanding year leading the team in goals, assists, steals and field blocks this season.</p>\n<p>“Any game, anyone we play, I know she is going to show up and play the same,” Kay said. “That is what we want to call the Gaucho way. It is what we want to be anytime and every time.”</p>\n<p>A player like Shore who can do it all makes it a lot easier on the team as a whole. The 2016 All-Big West honorable mention knows what it takes to be successful late in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin the UCI Invitational when they face No. 8 Michigan at 4:15 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25, at Corona Del Mar High School.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/","id":4921,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4920,4919,4918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Tennis Carries Its Four-Match Win Streak Into Pac-12 Matchups","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-24-at-11.16.41-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-24-at-11.16.41-AM.png?resize=974%2C571&ssl=1","description":"With its momentum high, currently on a four-match win streak, the UCSB women's tennis team has the chance to upset some top tier opponents from the Pac-12 in Washington and No. 4 Cal.

While the latest road trip could have kept UCSB struggling, the team has bounced back with confidence.</p>\n<p>The latest hot streak looks to be the result of a renewed form of team cohesion that has allowed the Gauchos to pull out victories in difficult matches.</p>\n<p>Players such as junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic have been a consistent presence for UCSB. The successes of both Dubavets and Stojic have given the Gauchos the opportunity to finish matches and earn the victory.</p>\n<p>This determination and team effort have both allowed for the tennis squad to find its rhythm and earn victories in games that it would have lost earlier in the season. Perhaps the best example of UCSB’s persistence and resilience was seen in its second win of the season against the then unbeaten Arizona Wildcats when the Gauchos were able to win 4-3 in a tough match.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Ducks have not had as much success on the road, as they have lost two of their last games on the road and have not picked up a victory since Jan. 29, having last played on Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>Oregon should be glad to finally be back home after a long road trip which prevented the Ducks from playing a game at the Oregon Student Tennis Center since Jan. 21. The Ducks have no ranked players in either the singles or doubles categories of the ITA rankings, which results in a difference in their matchup with UCSB.</p>\n<p>Oregon’s last game against the Texas Christian Horned Frogs ended in a 4-1 loss for the Ducks as they were unable to finish strong against a resilient TCU team.</p>\n<p>Like the Ducks, the Huskies do not have any ranked singles or doubles players. However, in Washington’s latest match, the team secured seven points in a straight sweep of the San Diego State Aztecs.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match against the Gauchos will surely be a good test for the Huskies as conference play gradually approaches in which their first Pac-12 game is against the Oregon Ducks on March 10.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play their first game of the weekend on Friday, Feb. 24, at noon. The second game of the weekend will be played on Saturday, Feb. 25, at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-tennis-carries-its-four-match-win-streak-into-pac-12-matchups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-tennis-carries-its-four-match-win-streak-into-pac-12-matchups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-tennis-carries-its-four-match-win-streak-into-pac-12-matchups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-tennis-carries-its-four-match-win-streak-into-pac-12-matchups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-tennis-carries-its-four-match-win-streak-into-pac-12-matchups/","id":1132,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1131,1130,1129],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Series of Road Matches Continue, Set To Face USF and No. 4 Cal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/UCSBClassicFriKennethSong-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/UCSBClassicFriKennethSong-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite having yet to play a home game, the UCSB men's tennis team is gradually building up steam as it has now won two consecutive matches entering its two road matchups.

He will look to build off his notable 6-2 and 6-3 performance last week. Overall, the team looks primed and ready for this doubleheader weekend.</p>\n<p>Since January, all of UCSB’s meets have been on the road, but so far that hasn’t deterred spirits. Its first home matches are set to take place beginning in March.</p>\n<p>The Dons are coming off a loss to BYU last Saturday, which resulted in a 2-4 final score.</p>\n<p>It was their first meet of West Coast Conference play. They only managed to secure their points during the singles portion of the competition, thanks to junior Johan Joenhagen and freshman Mert Zincirli. The duo also participated in the No. 1 doubles match, but it was to no avail as they fell to a 3-5 match score.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Sunday, the Gauchos will face perhaps their fiercest opponent yet in Cal. With regard to its victory over UCLA, the Berkeley squad began the competition by first claiming the doubles advantage point with a 6-4 finish for the No. 2 team and 6-1 for the No. 3s.</p>\n<p>The doubles portion was ultimately the decider as the singles portion was split even. The remainder of the 4-3 point victory came due to singles victories by freshman Bjorn Hoffmann, junior J.T. Nishimura and senior Florian Lakat.</p>\n<p>Both home sides will have much to prove come this weekend, as San Francisco will look to salvage the first half of its season with a win. Meanwhile, Berkeley will attempt to continue its display of dominance by trying to extinguish the streaking Gauchos, who have won two consecutive matches.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s play will wrap up the final matches scheduled for February. Another clean sweep for this upcoming doubleheader will put the Gauchos at 6-1 overall, a feat that is very much possible and perfectly timed considering the following eight meets will all take place at home in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>UCSB men’s tennis will travel away from home this Saturday, Feb. 25, for its 1 p.m. match against the University of San Francisco. The Gauchos will then head over to Cal for another 1 p.m. meet.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ucsbs-series-of-road-matches-continue-set-to-face-usf-and-no-4-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ucsbs-series-of-road-matches-continue-set-to-face-usf-and-no-4-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ucsbs-series-of-road-matches-continue-set-to-face-usf-and-no-4-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ucsbs-series-of-road-matches-continue-set-to-face-usf-and-no-4-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ucsbs-series-of-road-matches-continue-set-to-face-usf-and-no-4-cal/","id":1131,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1130,1129,1128],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Participate in Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-2.03.01-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-2.03.01-PM.png?resize=980%2C583&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will endure a challenging set of games this weekend as three of its five opponents are nationally ranked in the Top 25 of the NCAA rankings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Another busy weekend is fast approaching for the UCSB softball squad as the team travels to Cathedral City, Calif., for the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic.

She, too, has six RBIs, combined with four runs scored and a team pacing five doubles.</p>\n<p>The Cowboys boast two pitchers with winning records, senior Brandi Needham and first-year Logan Simunek. Needham has thrown two complete games, both shutouts, and holds a 1.66 ERA to go with a 3-1 win-loss record. She’s up to 14 strikeouts in 25 and a third innings pitched so far, more than doubling her earned run total of six over that span.</p>\n<p>The younger Simunek has appeared in seven of the 10 Oklahoma State games this season, and though her 3.42 ERA and 2-1 record don’t quite live up to the potency of her ace partner, the first-year has certainly held down the fort during her 14 innings of work.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, neither pitcher has allowed opponents to hit over .273 so far in 2017, so the Gauchos will need to reverse that trend as OSU will likely be one of their easier opponents at the tournament.</p>\n<p>Tennessee, the Gauchos’ next opponent in Thursday’s doubleheader, will enter Cathedral City undefeated. Coming off two straight shellackings in which they put up 14 runs on Oregon State and nine runs on New Mexico State, all while allowing no runs of their own, the Volunteers will be thirsty for blood and looking to improve their national rank against what appears to be an inferior UCSB opponent.</p>\n<p>The Volunteers boast several players with the potential to hit for power, most notably thus far being junior infielder Meghan Gregg and sophomore catcher and infielder Abby Lockman.</p>\n<p>Gregg leads the team with 18 RBIs, though Lockman is close on her tail with 13 of her own. They’re slugging an earth-shattering .964 and .842 respectively, the highest for players on the team who’ve participated in each of the Vols’ 10 games.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Gregg and Lockman are part of a three way tie for the team lead in home runs at two apiece, though they are just two of seven players to send one over the fence so far this season, emphasizing the penchant for offense on this Tennessee team.</p>\n<p>The Vols also rely on two workhorses within their pitching staff in sophomore Matty Moss and freshman Caylan Arnold. The two are responsible for nine of the team’s 10 wins, 49 of the team’s 57 innings and 53 of its 58 strikeouts. No one has been able to crack these two so far, though the Gauchos will take their shot Thursday.</p>\n<p>Purdue is UCSB’s only opponent on Friday, and their easiest one of the weekend. With only a 1-8 record, Purdue has lost four-straight games, including the final two only lasting five innings before ending due to the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>No one has hit a home run yet for the Boilermakers, and junior outfielder Maya Hughes, senior infielder Kristen Hoppman and sophomore utility player Mallory Baker are the only three batters approaching good seasons. Each holds a batting average over .260 — over .345 in the case of Hughes and Hoppman — and an on-base percentage over .345.</p>\n<p>Maddie Damon and Katie Johnson, a sophomore and senior respectively, have thrown the most innings on the team, just over 20 each, though Damon’s 1-1 record and 2.16 ERA is much more enticing compared to Johnson’s 0-5 mark and 9.33 ERA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ second nationally ranked opponent of the weekend will be the Missouri Tigers.</p>\n<p>This matchup will be the first between the two programs and will feature freshman shortstop Braxton Burnside. She will try and extend her two-game streak with a home run, and improve her already stellar average of .318.</p>\n<p>Burnside will be joined by fellow first year, outfielder Cayla Kessinger, who after a rough start to the season, has torn it up in her last two games, collecting four hits in six at-bats, three runs, a homer and a double.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face two West Coast opponents on the final day of the tournament, starting Sunday against Washington and finishing it with Arizona State.</p>\n<p>Those who made the final decision in the scheduling of games certainly put the Gauchos’ greatest challenge at the end of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Washington has only one blemish on their roster, a 4-2 loss to BYU (now ranked No. 23), and has won its last six games, most recently an 8-0 shutout of the CSUN Matadors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Taran Alvelo got the win in the contest, driving her record to 5-0, and junior Casey Stengel was able to keep her power streak alive, blasting one over the fence for the second game in a row.</p>\n<p>ASU is led by senior shortstop Chelsea Gonzales, the power hitting machine who’s slashed .538/.559/.885 in 10 games this season. Over that span, the Sun Devils have held a 9-1 record, due directly to the 14 hits, four doubles, one triple, one home run, 10 RBI and 23 total bases achieved by Gonzales.</p>\n<p>She’s propped up by a swell pitching staff, where each of the four dealers have at least two wins and an ERA no higher than 2.10. Junior Breanna Macha has thrown the most innings with 26, though first-year Giselle “G” Juarez and junior Dale Ryndak are the team’s strikeout queens with over 20 apiece.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still led by senior outfielder Kristen Clark in the lineup, holding a .519 average and .563 OBP, to go with 14 hits, two doubles and four RBI (Clark was finally able to draw a couple walks last weekend which had been a problem for her early in the season).</p>\n<p>Sierra Altmeyer, the sophomore infielder for the Gauchos, is third on the team with 12 total bases and is slashing a solid .333/.448/.500 in 2017, giving the Gauchos a glimmer of hope looking forward on offense.</p>\n<p>UCSB will still rely heavily on sophomore Veronika Gulvin and first-year Felisha Noriega, as both pitchers have crossed the 20-inning threshold on the season. Gulvin has her ERA down to 4.20, but Noriega’s 9.48 mark, combined with the atrocious ERA of the two pitchers behind them, is certainly cause for concern if the Gauchos’ two aces can’t handle the entire load this weekend.</p>\n<p>The action all begins Thursday at noon against Oklahoma State, and rounds out the evening of Sunday, Feb. 26, with Arizona State at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/","id":1186,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1185,1184,1183],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set for Home Opener, Will Host Tulane University  In Hopes of Resolving Offensive Issues After 1-3 Start","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-3.45.25-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-3.45.25-PM.png?resize=980%2C556&ssl=1","description":"After rainy weather conditions offset home games for the UCSB baseball team, the Gauchos will finally make their home debut vs. Tulane.

Army at home and a loss at Southeastern Louisiana earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>Both squads have no experience as of late in terms of having faced off, but the two teams almost met last year in the Tony Gwynn Classic. Had Tulane defeated UC San Diego, then it would have played Santa Barbara in the championship of the inaugural classic, which UCSB won.</p>\n<p>Another interesting tidbit is that the Green Waves actually defeated the Wildcats in that same tournament last season.</p>\n<p>That Arizona squad is the same one that went on to knock Santa Barbara off the College World Series, and went on to play for the College World Series championship before losing to eventual champion Coastal Carolina in three games.</p>\n<p>Experience was something the Gauchos expected they would be able to rely on heading into this season, as opposed to last year, but that has not been the case through four matches. In fact, UCSB looks like a completely different squad from a year ago after displaying many offensive struggles against Loyola Marymount and Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>Two players that were key components of the CWS squad, redshirt junior J.J. Muno and junior Austin Bush, have struggled mightily thus far. The redshirt junior and true junior have combined to bat 1-29 at the plate this year and striked out a total of 12 times in 29 at-bats.</p>\n<p>Last year, Muno had the best batting average on the team in players that had at least 140 at-bats after tallying 68 hits on 231 at-bats (.294), of which 18 were extra-base hits and five were home runs.</p>\n<p>This year, the second baseman has yet to register a hit in 14 at-bats. While he has managed to drive in two runs, the struggles are certainly concerning seeing how big a role Muno played a season ago.</p>\n<p>Bush’s struggles are on par with Muno’s as he is currently 1-15 on the season and has struck out a team-high seven times. The designated hitter is known to strike out a lot, as he proved last season with 60 strikeouts, the second-highest mark in the Big West; however, his game is predicated on his ability to hit the ball out of the park, something he did a lot with 11 homers, a league best as no other player registered double-digit home runs.</p>\n<p>Despite this, one veteran who has continued to excel into the new year is junior Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>The shortstop currently ranks third on the team in batting average (.333) and is tied for first in both hits (5) and home runs (1). Fisher’s defensive presence is something that has garnered national attention since his acrobatic plays that made Sportscenter, which the Gauchos will also continue to rely on, as he has converted on three double-play opportunities.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">ICYMI… RT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNU\">@ESPNU</a>: Is that Clay Fisher or Derek Jeter? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCSB_Baseball\">@UCSB_Baseball</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAACWS\">@NCAACWS</a></p>\n<p>Watch LIVE: <a href=\"https://t.co/0dEzqJ5k9I\">https://t.co/0dEzqJ5k9I</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oqCbK61Ug3\">pic.twitter.com/oqCbK61Ug3</a></p>\n<p>— Big West Baseball (@BigWestBaseball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigWestBaseball/status/738873869310758912\">June 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>UCSB will also hope to continue get great play from newcomers Colton Burns and Landon Silver. Burns, a junior college transfer, presently owns the best mark on the team in batting average (.385) and slugging percentage (.615). Freshman outfielder Silver has also been a welcomed addition, slashing .375/.444/.375 in three games played.</p>\n<p>Pitching on the mound Friday will be sophomore Noah Davis, who put forth a spectacular start last week, which saw him earn his and the team’s first win of the year. Against LMU, the right-hander went six innings allowing only four hits, one earned run and one walk alongside four strikeouts on 74 pitches.</p>\n<p>Sunday probable starter Joe Record will look to remedy a disappointing effort against Loyola, in which he only managed 3.2 innings allowing four runs, three of which were earned runs.</p>\n<p>Junior Kyle Nelson turned heads on Saturday as he started the game. Primarily known as a reliever, the left-hander went four innings in his first start of the year, allowing five hits and one earned run which, unfortunately, was enough to hand him the loss.</p>\n<p>The decision to start Nelson going forward will be interesting considering that, before the season, he was named the No. 6 reliever in the country by D1Baseball and was included on the NCBWA Stopper of the Year Watch List for the second time in his career.</p>\n<p>For Tulane, taking a series from a serious contender for making the NCAA regionals again would be a huge boost in turning around this season and looking more like the team from a year ago that made it as far as the Oxford Regional.</p>\n<p>Aiming to defend its AAC championship, the Green Waves will primarily rely on senior Hunter Williams, who currently holds the team’s best batting average after going 7-16 (.438) through the first four games. The infielder is also a threat with the long ball, as he already has two homers and is currently holding a slugging percentage .875.</p>\n<p>Senior Corey Merrill will also be a tough play on Friday. The right-handed pitcher had a solid first outing pitching seven innings and allowing only six hits, two earned runs en route to a victory.</p>\n<p>Despite the slow start, this certainly does not entail a bad season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Four games is hardly a sample size worth noting when deciding to write a team off, especially when one factors that Santa Barbara’s most effective players have had early season struggles.</p>\n<p>Once those are corrected, who’s to say what could happen?</p>\n<p>To put things into perspective, current No. 15 Arizona started last year 2-3 before getting back on track and going on to have a spectacular season, finishing 38-20 on the year and making its college world series appearance. Point being, UCSB has plenty of time to get things in gear, but getting started sooner rather than later would be ideal.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins a three-game series with Tulane at 2 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 24, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium with Saturday and Sunday’s games taking place at the same location and beginning at 2 p.m. and 1 p.m., respectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Catcher/infielder Jake Ortega then turned loose on a 1-0 pitch count and doubled down the left field line scoring a run and extending the lead to 2-0. The sophomore finished the night 1-3 with the lone RBI. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although allowing two runs in the second, Clements was nearly unhittable the rest of the way allowing only two hits. However, the junior picked up his first loss of the season after 5.1 innings pitched, allowing six hits, two earned runs, two walks and only registering one strikeout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moten, a sophomore who had been solid all day, began to struggle as the eighth progressed. After freshman outfielder Landon Silver took a walk, junior shortstop Clay Fisher singled to left putting runners on first and second with no outs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a sac bunt advancing the runners a base, Moten was relieved by Dewsnap ending a solid afternoon’s work. The right-hander finished the evening after 7.1 innings allowing only three hits and one earned run while registering nine strikeouts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to the plate was junior utility Colton Burns who continued his hot start to the season with a single right up the middle scoring Silver and putting Fisher, the tying run, at third with only one out. Burns finished the day 2-2 with a RBI.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this very advantageous position, the Gauchos failed to capitalize as junior designated hitter Austin Bush could not muster a hit or even a sac fly as he struck out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two outs, J.J. Muno still had a chance to tie the game, but the redshirt junior continues to struggle as he flew out to left field and was unable to score the tying run. The second baseman finished the night 0-4 and is still hitless on the season through four games as he is 0-14. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting out of the tough jam, Dewsnap was able to finish off the Gauchos in the ninth securing the victory for Moten and earning his first save of the season. The junior finished allowing only one hit and striking out two batters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the season first began last week, especially after an opening day victory, no one could’ve expected the offensive struggles that are currently plaguing UCSB. However, with the season still in its early stages, there is no need to press a panic button yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, now that the Gauchos are coming home, maybe the offensive struggles can be corrected behind the roar of a great Gaucho crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara faces off against Tulane at Caesar Uyeska Stadium beginning Friday, Feb. 24, at 2 p.m. for a three-game series this weekend.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
