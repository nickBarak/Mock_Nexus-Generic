Junior Michael McAdoo and freshman Drew Williams advanced to third and second on a throwing error by the Matador starting pitcher. Junior Sam Cohen sent a single to right field to bring Williams home while a sacrifice fly from freshman Jason Willow would score McAdoo for his 28th run of the year.</p>\n<p>Freshman Brandon Bohning opened the third inning with an extra-base hit and junior Trevor Casanova would hit a sacrifice fly to bring Bohning home after he advanced to third during the previous at-bat. Casanova earned his 28th RBI of the season and brought his team to within one run of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Chris Lincoln started the game for the Gauchos and would only go as far as the fourth inning. With four hits allowed and two earned runs the right handed pitcher, did as well as he could in minimizing the damage from a couple of mistakes on the mound. The sub-five inning start is Lincoln’s first since a Mar. 17 appearance against Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>The Matadors scored a pair of runs in the fifth and sixth innings to gain and pad their lead. Casanova came through for his team again and more specifically his teammate Bohning who would cross the plate again on his single to the right side. Senior Nolan Bumstead would single in Casanova in his at-bat before UCSB was able to get out of the inning down a run, 4-3.</p>\n<p>Senior Alvaro Rubalcaba singled to right center to score senior Riley Conlan before Bohning would get an RBI of his own to score Rubalcaba, and put the tally at 6-3.</p>\n<p>Junior Thomas Rowan would crush a ball over the right field fence in the bottom of the seventh inning for his third homer of the season. The longball put UCSB behind by two, but the deficit was too much to overcome and were not able to put any further damage on the CSUN starter.</p>\n<p>Junior Walker Armstrong went the distance against the Gauchos, giving up four hits and three earned runs over nine innings pitched. The complete game is the right handers second of the season and the marathon effort was good enough to earn him his second win on the year. Despite getting into trouble early on in the game, Armstrong was extremely successful in being able to bear down and prevent UCSB from mounting enough momentum to try to make an attempt to take back the lead after giving it up.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play the Cal State University, Northridge Matadors  on Saturday, May 5 at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/","id":4287,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4286,4285,4284],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Seeking To Gain Conference Edge, Hosts CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MBaseBall_vs_UTRGV_20180408_SiavashGhadiri-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MBaseBall_vs_UTRGV_20180408_SiavashGhadiri-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As the conference season winds down the Gauchos are looking to make one final push up the Big West standings.

Before that, the Matadors had lost five of their last six conference games being swept by UC Irvine and dropping two of three to last-place Long Beach State.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the other side, UCSB picked up a big series win against UCR at home last weekend but failed to pull off a sweep which would have put them in a much better place heading down the stretch. The Gauchos can correct that with a sweep, or at the very least, a series win over CSUN.</p>\n<p>Currently in fourth place, Santa Barbara has 12 games remaining against conference opponents, nine of which will be against teams currently ranked lower than them in the standings, including Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Needing wins, UCSB must rely on some of its key components in order to get the job done this weekend against CSUN.</p>\n<p>Having an unusually down year, sophomore infielder Armani Smith has struggled at the plate. The sophomore is barely batting above .200 on the season. However, in the last five games, Smith has gone 6-16 (.375) at the plate along with eight RBIs. He also hit a three-run big fly in Tuesday’s win against CSUB, his fifth homer of the season.</p>\n<p>If Smith’s big bat is back in action in the lineup, then UCSB truly has a solid starting nine. Sophomore centerfielder Tommy Jew has also been a great bat in the Santa Barbara lineup, currently slashing .294/.382/.451 on the season.</p>\n<p>Last week, Jew received Big West Conference Field Player of the Week after leading the Gauchos to a series win over UC Riverside last weekend. The sophomore went 9-15 (.600) with seven RBIs, scoring six runs while also totaling four extra-base hits including his third home run of the season.</p>\n<p>One thing UCSB will need to be cognizant of, however, is their pitching, as it allowed 24 runs against UCR and another five against CSUB. Sophomore Chris Lincoln (2.19 ERA, 2-2) and senior Stevie Ledesma (2.55 ERA, 5-2) have the second and fourth-best ERA marks in the conference respectively.</p>\n<p>As a team, the pitching staff has a combined 4.10 ERA, and they will have their work cut out for them facing CSUN with their team batting average of .281, the third-best mark in the conference.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Matadors also have the third best on-base percentage (.364) and even the best slugging percentage (.459) in the conference. A big part of that is because the Matadors have arguably the best long-ball hitter in the Big West in senior Albee Weiss.</p>\n<p>The outfielder and catcher currently has 15 home runs on the season, a mark that is not only far and away the best mark in the conference but also sits at eighth nationally. Weiss also has 48 RBIs, the top mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>CSUN also has the conference’s most efficient hitter as redshirt junior utility Trevor Casanova currently boasts a .380 batting average. Casanova also has 27 RBIs on the year. As a team, Cal State Northridge has three athletes batting above .300 on the year.</p>\n<p>While the whole series will be intriguing, seeing how UCSB pitchers adjust to facing a strong offensive team will be a real treat. To be fair, however, CSUN has batted .257 in conference play, a mark that has them sitting seventh in the conference, so something will have to give.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, this series is important because they have another chance to really step on the throat of a team that is a bit weaker than the rest in this conference. With CSUF sitting with a 9-3 Big West mark, Santa Barbara cannot afford to take many more losses in this conference season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hosts Cal State Northridge for a three-game set beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 4, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 3rd, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>From a family whose volleyball aspirations brought them to compete at the collegiate level comes the next generation to continue that legacy.</p>\n<p>It took Randy DeWeese plenty of hard work and determination during his journey into the NCAA. Now a key part of the No. 12 team in the nation, DeWeese’s elite showings every game night are a testament to his skill as much as a prime example of why the Gauchos will be in good hands at the setter position for years to come.</p>\n<p>DeWeese is only a sophomore here at UCSB, but with already-impressive stats of a team-high 637 assists and a 7.41 assists-per-set ratio, you might figure him for a seasoned vet at first. Those rankings were also the sixth-best mark in the Big West Conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As the starting setter for the Gauchos men’s volleyball team, he is a great role model of how every practice, gym session and game is just another opportunity to improve daily. Although his best volleyball moments are still sure to come, it’s equally fascinating to understand his journey of how he became one of the best setters in the nation for his age.</p>\n<p>“My mom played at the U of A, my uncle at Stanford and the junior national team. So I knew I had it in me,” DeWeese said. “I just had to put in the work and grind it out. That way I was able to figure it all out before I got to college.”</p>\n<p>Growing up in NorCal’s Sacramento area, volleyball had always played a big part in his life. When considering his family’s direct ties to the sport, he really wanted to continue in their footsteps and excel at the same elite level, and that’s exactly what he did.</p>\n<p>Early on, DeWeese received much praise in his time playing club volleyball for Northern California Volleyball Club (NCVC). He earned various accolades for his performances all around the court, such as a spot on the U.S. Junior National Training Team and a feature in <em>Volleyball Magazine</em>’s “Fab 50.” Still, it became very clear that his strongest ability was that of his playmaking expertise at the setter position.</p>\n<p>Soon enough, that tough process of going from club to college began and he started reaching out to some of the best programs in the nation. In the beginning, DeWeese was no stranger to rejection as out-of-state responses didn’t go as planned. Luckily, it was his home state of California who came to the rescue as some of the Big West’s head coaches started to take notice of his true playmaking potential.</p>\n<p>“I started looking pretty early on, around my sophomore year, and that’s when I first found Santa Barbara,” DeWeese said. “I also visited UCI and UCLA, but I just didn’t feel it…UCSB was just so perfect.”</p>\n<p>Just like most other collegiate athletes, this transition to the next level took a toll on DeWeese. Whether it was intense practice sessions or putting in that extra hour in the gym, DeWeese points out that each day is a positional battle for all members of the team.</p>\n<p>“Playing for Santa Barbara was really eye-opening; it showed me just how hard I had to work,” DeWeese said. “Even if the talent is there, you really have to apply yourself, you have to try harder every day. That way you get to where you want to be and achieve whatever you want.”</p>\n<p>DeWeese also points out that everyone on the roster wants to start and that even some of his closest friends are the teammates whom he competes against. Nevertheless, coaches will only start those who are willing to put in the time and effort to deserve that starting position.</p>\n<p>Following an earlier than expected exit from this recent postseason, the Gauchos finished the year with an 11-13 overall record and in fifth place in the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>Despite that, fans must also realize that No. 12 UCSB was No. 15 in NCAA rankings earlier in the year, showing that they did improve throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Also, the Big West is perhaps the most competitive league since there are a total of four top-10 programs who also participate. Therefore, this was much more than a growing season, it was a preview of just how great UCSB can become over these next few years.</p>\n<p>Earlier this season, Santa Barbara claimed upset wins against No. 3 UC Irvine, No. 6 BYU, No. 8 CSUN and No. 10 Ball State.</p>\n<p>“Considering we were one of the younger teams in the league, this season went fairly successful. We took a few games against some highly ranked opponents and that caught a lot of people off guard. Just showing what we were capable of was a huge step for us, and we’re going to be that same kind of team next year,” DeWeese said. “I think we’re not far behind at all … We are young, but a big goal for us would be breaking into the top 10 and maintaining that throughout the year.”</p>\n<p>Considering only a quarter of the total team is upperclassmen, UCSB certainly will look to improve their play. Of those four upperclassmen, only one is a senior. Therefore, practically the same familiar squad will be lining up for the Gauchos next year, and UCSB’s star setter has high hopes for the next step of expected progression during this offseason.</p>\n<p>“The way our returning group is progressing has been really fast and we’re learning how to truly play together,” DeWeese said. “And other teams will have to change their dynamic to fit with new players, whereas our starting lineup looks to stay the same next year. So it’s nice knowing that we’ll have that chemistry advantage in next season’s league.”</p>\n<p>As true with any team of any sport, a change in both players and personnel can make or break a team. Luckily for UCSB, this returning group of now experienced players will be able to function together at a higher level.</p>\n<p>However, the fact still remains that the Gauchos compete in the Big West, one of the most competitive volleyball conferences in the entire nation.  Including UCSB, five of the total six league teams in the Big West have been ranked all year long within the top-15 programs in NCAA poll rankings.</p>\n<p>“I think a good goal for us would be staying in the top 10 and maintaining it through the whole year,” said DeWeese when asked about his expectations for the team next season. “When it comes to conference play, taking a third seed or better would be ideal…then winning in the first round of the Big West tournament.”</p>\n<p>Upon first thought, DeWeese’s goal seems very challenging. However, considering UCSB has beaten half of the 12 different teams they played in the top 15 this season, it seems like a very possible feat. With added context, No. 12 UCSB was not ranked within the top 15 at all in the beginning of the year; however, at one point this season they went as high as the 11th-best program in the nation.</p>\n<p>All in all, DeWeese will continue to play a huge part in the game plans of UCSB men’s volleyball, and he only earned his role because of all the years he spent developing his craft. In essentially any competitive scenario, a team is only as good as its leader. In volleyball, players look to their setter for both playmaking production and quality control.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s program is lucky to have a positional leader like DeWeese, and he proves that every game night when he leaves it all out on the court. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 3rd</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82847\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82847\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/","id":3395,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3394,3393,3392],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season In Review: 2017-2018 Women’s Water Polo","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2018-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WomensWaterpoloVSCSUN_4-7-18_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WomensWaterpoloVSCSUN_4-7-18_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Although the Gauchos couldn't break the top half of the Big West this year, their youth and consistent improvement as the season went on are indicators of a bright future.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_82658\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WomensWaterpoloVSCSUN_4-7-18_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1917619685\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82856\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82658\" data-attachment-id=\"82658\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/attacker-shannon-moran-looks-for-a-pass-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WomensWaterpoloVSCSUN_4-7-18_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1356&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1356\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Attacker Shannon Moran looks for a pass.

With a team-leading 42 steals on the year, she was able to have an impact defensively despite having the primary responsibility of initiating the offense in the front court.</p>\n<p>“She won 89/100 sprints which is incredible,” Kay explained. “She made an impact right away and led the team in steals as well. She did a great job as a freshman and I look forward to seeing what she does in the future.”</p>\n<p>Pipkin had her most efficient season in her Gaucho career as she found the back of the net 44 times, assisted on 35 Santa Barbara goals and ranked among the top three in overall points on the year.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to improve next season, it will be crucial for Pipkin, Snyder and Simmons to continue to elevate their game and learn from their past experiences from this season.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder also had a tremendous year as she had 171 saves on the season with a save percentage of 59.</p>\n<p>As the anchor of the Gauchos’ defense, Snyder often frustrated opponents by preventing potential goals from finding the back of the net with the help of her quick reflexes.</p>\n<p>One highlight of the year was in a game vs UC Davis when Snyder threw the ball over Davis’ keeper and into the Aggies’ goal from her own goal.</p>\n<p>“Goalkeepers are the most important position in polo in my opinion,” Kay stated. “She did a good job and the future is definitely bright. With two years under her belt, I expect her to really rise to the occasion.”</p>\n<p>With everyone returning except senior defender Annie Mortimer, Santa Barbara will look to build on the chemistry they have already developed this year and perfect their craft for next season.</p>\n<p>“I expect us to pick up right where we left off,” Kay explained. “I think it is important that we reflect during this offseason on the things we did well and improve on them. At this point, I don’t think we need to change anything dramatically but instead just need to get better at what we are doing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to develop over this offseason as they aim to climb to the top of the Big West next season with a more experienced group that will use this past season as motivation to elevate their level of play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82856\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82856\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/","id":4870,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4869,4868,4867],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pasternack Adds Combo of Freshmen & Grad Transfers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team has added three freshmen and two graduate transfers.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Big news in recent weeks has occurred for the UCSB men’s basketball program as Head Coach Joe Pasternack has reeled in another top transfer. This time it’s Ar’mond Davis from the University of Alabama, who will be immediately eligible as a grad transfer.</p>\n<p>We’ve already seen the value of transfers for the Gauchos with this past season’s talents of Leland King II and Marcus Jackson, both essential pieces to the Gauchos’ bounce-back season.<br>\nUCSB is facing the biggest turnover of the top Big West teams, losing four of their top five scorers to graduation, while UC Irvine, Fullerton and UC Davis are all returning the majority of their top options.</p>\n<p>The incoming freshmen recruits and the transfers will need to step up to the plate and support leading scorer and First Team All Big West guard Max Heidegger and the returning Gauchos if UCSB wants to continue building on Pasternack’s successful first season at the helm. Let’s preview the newcomers and what their contributions could mean for the Gauchos’ next season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>THE FRESHMEN</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Amadou Sow</strong><br>\nThe 6-foot-9 forward from Mali gives the Gauchos a presence down low as rebounding is his biggest strength. He’s got the size to finish plays on both sides of the court with his ability to block shots and finish baskets.</p>\n<p>Sow played for the prestigious Oakland Soldiers AAU squad, playing against top players around the country and holding his own. The physical big man should make an immediate impact for the Gauchos and could be a big part of the rotation.</p>\n<p>Expect him and senior Ami Lakoju to hold the paint down for the Gauchos. With USCB a bit thinner on big men next year, it is possible for Sow to play big minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Sékou Touré</strong><br>\nThe 6 foot 5 wing has the potential to fill the stat sheet for the Gauchos as he has great rebounding and defensive skills. He’ll need to improve his three-point shooting as that wasn’t really part of his game in his time with the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>Pasternack should try to develop that part of his game, and he has been quoted as saying he believes Touré, “by his freshman year, he will be a knockdown three-point shooter.”It will be exciting to see if he can make that leap this summer and give the Gauchos another added threat from deep.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay Nagle</strong><br>\nNagle’s game is one of the most intriguing because he can give the Gauchos a new dynamic as a solid role player from the beginning. He’s 6-foot-8, shoots threes at a tremendous clip of 44 percent and he’s shot nearly 400 in his junior and senior years alone.</p>\n<p>If he can play some defense, his offensive value should be evident from the get-go. UCSB was 220th in three-pointers attempted last year, and while they shot a great percentage, they did not have a guy who could just let it go at a high volume with a quick release besides Heidegger.</p>\n<p>When Heidegger and Nagle share the court, the defense will be stretched out tremendously by their gravity, so I can see Nagle making an instant impact with his one elite skill of shooting the long ball.</p>\n<p><strong>THE TRANSFERS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ar’mond Davis</strong><br>\nDavis is the newest of the newcomers to the Gauchos for next season. The 6-foot-6 guard will be a grad transfer and will be immediately eligible next season.</p>\n<p>He’s starred at Southern Idaho and was rated the No.6 Junior College player in the country after his first two years there. Since then he transferred to Alabama, where he played pretty well, averaging six points per game in 13 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>He got injured before the start of this season and had to sit out, but if he can recover well, he should be a key contributor for UCSB.</p>\n<p>While he was inefficient in his shooting in his lone season at Alabama, his shot has good arc to it and a quick release, and he was far more efficient at Southern Idaho shooting 45 percent from the field. Davis adds another wing to what should be a position of strength for the Gauchos’ next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Devearl Ramsey</strong><br>\nRamsey is a 5-foot-10 guard who transferred from the University of Nevada in 2017. He’s been on campus for a year already, so he should be used to playing with the team.</p>\n<p>He was a top recruit out of high school and shouldn’t be surprised to start for the Gauchos, especially if Coach Pasternack favors Heidegger in the off-ball guard role he often played next to Gabe Vincent last year.</p>\n<p>He should replace some of the Gauchos’ playmaking needs even if he does come off the bench. The Gauchos are losing over 10 assists per game from the graduating seniors, and Ramsey’s game favors getting his teammates the ball, even reaching nine assists in a single game at Nevada.</p>\n<p>One other source of optimism for Ramsey is the success of former Nevada teammate King last year. If Ramsey can make half as much of an impact as King did last year, then the Gauchos should be very happy.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wrap-Up</strong></p>\n<p>The Gauchos may look different, but don’t count them out for a similarly strong showing in Pasternack’s second year at the helm. Heidegger returns as one of the best gunners in college basketball and should be a strong favorite to win Big West player of the year after he was robbed of the award this time around.</p>\n<p>While key contributors like King and Vincent are gone, Pasternack has rebuilt this team with a focus on athletic swingmen. Expect the Gauchos to have a quick, switchy defense and to be more perimeter-focused next year.</p>\n<p>We know guys like Heidegger, Nagle and the other newcomers in the backcourt can hit shots from outside, but the key for the Gauchos to reach a high ceiling could be their frontline headlined by the freshman Sow and senior Lakoju.

The game lasted until the eleventh inning when UCR exploded for four runs and was able to shut down UCSB to avoid the series sweep. Only six runs were batted in with junior Thomas Rowan and freshman Drew Williams tying for the team lead with two RBIs a piece.</p>\n<p>Jack Dashwood would make the start for the Gauchos but only went 1.2 innings with three earned runs. Junior Alex Patterson took over for Luke Andrews in the top of the fourth and made the best outing for the team pitching 3.1 innings with one hit allowed. Seven different Gaucho pitchers would appear in the game each allowing 1+ earned run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Freshman Chris Troye would pitch the Gauchos from the ninth inning until the top of the eleventh before giving up a single. Sophomore Ben Brecht replaced Troye and gave up a three-run home run to Highlander Anthony Lepre. With the first runner scored being Troye’s responsibility, the freshman would get tagged with the loss.</p>\n<p>CSU Bakersfield’s last series was on a road trip to Washington to play Seattle University where the team lost 4-10. The Redhawks victory in the final match was their second consecutive and gave the team the series win. The Roadrunners struggled to match the Redhawks offensive success and starter Nick Meservey kept Bakersfield scoreless his entire outing. Junior Ryan Koch, who leads the team in RBIs on the year, went 0-4 in the game.</p>\n<p>Junior Noah Barba and freshman Daniel Carrizosa stayed hot in the series as each got a hit and RBI in the game. Hits, runs, and batting average team leader Andrew Penner was another Roadrunner with an RBI. The .341 average hitter has been a consistent and dangerous offensive threat for the Roadrunners and will be a problem for the Gauchos’ pitching rotation.</p>\n<p>Despite making a huge impact early on in the Riverside series, sophomore Tommy Jew and junior Clay Fisher quieted down a bit in their final game gathering a combined three hits. The three hit total is an average outcome compared to Fisher’s perfect day at the plate the day before and Jew’s four hit two RBI performance the day before that.</p>\n<p>The dynamic duo have been the Gauchos’ top two offensive producers on the season with the two occupying the top places in the major offensive categories. Williams has been getting hot as of late as the freshman has shown an ability to get key hits for his team that result in runs on the board.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunner pitching staff which struggled much like the Gauchos’ against Riverside will be looking to bounce back against Fisher, Jew, and the others.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still .500 in the Big West Conference, having a record of six wins and six losses. The record is enough to put them at fourth in the conference and will be a good preview game as CSU Bakersfield will be joining the Gauchos in the Conference in 2022.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/","id":4274,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4273,4272,4271],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Unwavering Unity: A Look Inside The UCSB Women’s Rugby Team","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unnamed-e1525217406593.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unnamed-e1525217406593.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Although the UCSB Women's Rugby team might not get the attention that other sports do here on campus, their dedication and spirit are second to none.

While rugby is a sport that is widely popular, many don’t know that we have an incredible women’s team on campus.</p>\n<p>I got to sit down with a few of the ladies from the team as we discussed their motto of unity, how playing such an intense sport brings meaning to their lives, and how lacking sufficient school funding makes them rise above the rest.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Going just 2-4 in the regular season last year, the team found solace in their new head coach Zac Winter this season, who helped implement new practices and work hard to turn the team around.</p>\n<p>He certainly did his job well as the rugby team was nothing short of amazing this year, beating nearly every team in their way. Loaded with passion and exuding confidence, you’d be hard pressed to find another sport with athletes as driven as those on the UCSB women’s rugby team. With six seniors on the roster set to graduate, it was only appropriate that the team put on such a dominant performance in the regular season.</p>\n<p>Ending second in the league with an 8-3 record, the Gauchos were not able to carry that magic into the postseason as they lost to opponent Chico to end their journey to the championship. The team is not discouraged though, as they all mentioned that there is nowhere else for them to go but up.</p>\n<p>Rugby is a sport that requires precision, aggression, and players who aren’t afraid to get dirty or risk injury. “We do get crazy injuries, and if anything, we’re proud of them,” Sophomore treasurer Kayla Aurelio Hughes cleared up, “But there is so much more to our team and our story than just concussions and broken thumbs.”</p>\n<p>The team admitted that while the susceptibility to injuries is sometimes imminent, it makes the playing of the sport that much more enjoyable. No matter what happens to a teammate on the field, there is always another teammate right behind, ready to help with whatever the other needs – both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>Junior Jasmine Guevara pointed out that rugby has played a huge role in her life and her social circle: “When I first got to UCSB, knowing how shy I am, I honestly thought I wasn’t going to make many friends if not any. And here I am two and half years later, loving the sport and having more friends than I could have ever asked for, friends I know I can count on and off the field.”</p>\n<p>Unity is something the ladies make clear is the basis in all that they do, not leaving anyone behind. In a world full of inequality, the morale of the Gauchos women’s rugby team embeds the notion that their team is no place for any hate or opposition – unity and acceptance is all they know.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Maria Tejada gushed about the team’s motto of unity when asked about how it defines the team. She explained that “unity is the theme of our team for so many reasons. We win games because of unity, we work hard to come back from injuries because of unity, and we are extremely accepting because we have big hearts and because of unity.”</p>\n<p>While the team’s unity and standout aggressive play is not to be overlooked, often times they find themselves dedicating a lot of time to off-the-field activities as well. Funding is something UCSB women’s rugby works hard to keep steady, as they don’t receive as much school funding as several other teams on campus.</p>\n<p>“While we do get some funding from Rec Sports to help pay for coaching, we mainly rely on dues from players and fundraising,” senior Social Chair Haley Pedersen revealed, “It’s just an additional stress that gets in the way of our team growing. Fundraising can be hard because all clubs are trying to do the same fundraisers and when it comes to getting donations, there are a lot of people who do not support women playing rugby.”</p>\n<p>Despite the need to be assertive in their fundraising practices, the team makes sure not to let money concerns stop them from playing the sport they love. Senior Fundraising Chair Miranda Nillo optimistically noted that “since [The rugby team is] pretty much autonomous, it puts a lot of pressure on team leaders as far as what we decide to spend our money on. However, even though we’re not primarily school funded, we do know that the girls who do want to play rugby are willing to pay for it and are here for a reason! We’re all so passionate about rugby!”</p>\n<p>The heart of the Gauchos’ women’s rugby team is palpable, and their fortitude is unmatched. The cohesiveness of the group as a unit, translates through their superior play both on and off the field in all that they do. Women’s rugby not only participates in various fundraisers for their own team dealings, but they also consistently offer their time and effort to various charity events, giving back even whenever they can.</p>\n<p>The team is a well-oiled machine, with each member playing a pivotal part in keeping their success afloat. Hughes admired her team’s heart and ability to stay strong no matter what. She made sure to note that, “the girls keep the program running. I am so grateful to play with a group of driven, motivated women who don’t let anything get in their way.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho’s women’s rugby team proves that there is insurmountable strength in numbers, by displaying toughness through their unwavering team unity and proving that division is an unwelcome team weakness. Working together as a supportive unit, aids the team in accomplishing their goals together on the field and throughout their college career. Balancing school, sports, and jobs, these are some of the most talented women at Santa Barbara that you’ll ever meet.</p>\n<p>No team, funding issues, or opposition can stop the UCSB women’s rugby team – they are determined not to let anything get in their way.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/","id":3400,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[3399,3398,3397],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Snyder Sings and Scores: Sarah’s Major Pregame Ritual","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For most athletes, a pregame routine consists of them listening to their favorite music, eating a healthy snack or going over plays that they want to run against their respective opponent.

She is also considered one of the leaders of the team as she brings a gritty attitude and carries a lot of responsibility on the team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With such a hectic schedule consisting of practices, classes, traveling and studying, it is almost impossible to not feel stressed with so many things going on.</p>\n<p>However, for Snyder, singing has allowed her to de-stress ever since her childhood.</p>\n<p>“I was four when I started singing, and my mom kind of forced me into choir,” she said. “It started off as a cool thing where I had friends, and it was something aside from sports that I could do. I love singing because it is a way to add positivity to my life.”</p>\n<p>Although it may seem that singing was always a positive experience for Snyder, this was not always the case. When she was seven years old, she was told to sing the national anthem at a local swim meet, but in the middle of the song, she forgot some of the words, which led to a very traumatic experience.</p>\n<p>“I was scarred,” she said. “I did not sing for two more years, but I finally had the courage to do it again two years later.”</p>\n<p>It would be reasonable to imagine that she would have had to sacrifice some of her time singing to primarily focus on her water polo career, but that could not be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>“Being a student athlete is definitely time consuming, so I don’t really have much time for other things, but I sing around the house and the pool a lot,” Snyder explained. “I don’t really sacrifice much.”</p>\n<p>The idea of Snyder singing the national anthem before games first came about when Head Coach Serela Kay asked her to sing the piece on Senior Day of the 2017 season.<br>\nWith the whole team on board with the decision, Snyder decided that she would give it a shot despite being extremely nervous that she would make a mistake.</p>\n<p>“My nerves are already up before games and my adrenaline is going,” Snyder explained. “My heart is racing and adding singing to that is very difficult. I was like, I got to do it for the seniors and then it just turned into something after that.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether she had to audition for Coach Kay, Snyder chuckled and explained how she was asked to perform. She would also go on to advocate for freshman Sami Stebbins joining her in the near future.</p>\n<p>“Sami Stebbins is pretty good,” she explained. “She is really good actually. When I leave, she will probably carry the torch.”</p>\n<p>For Snyder, there will never be any singing competitions between her and her teammates because they all have talented voices. Instead, her idea is that the best singers on the team should sing the national anthem together rather than one person having the spotlight.</p>\n<p>“No competitions,” Snyder explained. “I think Sami has a great voice. I would love for her to sing with me. Pip also has a great voice and can play the guitar. Emily can sing also. We should do it all together but definitely no competition.”</p>\n<p>Despite the stress that comes with singing before games, Snyder has been able to limit it through a mantra that she has recently started to follow profusely.</p>\n<p>“Singing probably makes me more tense before games, but a little mantra that I have been sticking with is that failure doesn’t exist and carries over into every aspect in my life,” Snyder said. “If you can’t fail, you can’t succeed, and the least I can do is try.”</p>\n<p>When performing in front of her teammates, Snyder has mixed emotions, especially since she is singing in front of the home crowd as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s nerve-wracking but comfortable, I’d say,” Snyder said. “I know they are all supportive even if I forget the words to the national anthem. Nobody will be upset or anything, so I feel very supported. It helps having a very close-knit team so everybody is always there for each other.”</p>\n<p>With the support of her teammates and the home crowd, it makes performing a lot easier as she explains that the applause quells her nerves and strengthens her bond with her teammates.</p>\n<p>She often finds herself listening to alternative rock in her free time, as it sets her into a positive mood as she goes through her hectic schedule.</p>\n<p>“I love so much music,” Snyder said. “I actually started with classic rock because my dad used to play it all the time. My favorite artists are probably bands nobody has ever heard of. I like Arctic Monkeys and Parachute in particular. When songs like “More Than A Feeling” by Boston come on, I am definitely blasting it in my car.”</p>\n<p>Despite being such a talented singer, her primary focus is on water polo and her education, as well as finding the perfect balance between the two.</p>\n<p>“As of right now, water polo and school is the most important thing right now,” Snyder said. “If I could become a pop star, that would be awesome, but it is not in the cards right now. Or probably ever.

Both senior utility Virginia Smith and senior center Alexandra Massier tallied hat tricks in the contest but the 49ers could not hold off the red-hot Anteater offense.</p>\n<p>Massier leads the way for Long Beach State with 35 goals on the year while junior attacker Tori Morrissey has 10 assists on the year to lead the team.</p>\n<p>The teams have met twice this year with the ’Chos winning the first matchup in early February by five goals while the 49ers claimed the second matchup by one goal in March to start conference play.</p>\n<p>It will be crucial for the Gauchos to continue their defensive success in order get past the 49ers, starting with the play of sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder. The Santa Ana native is coming off a contest in which she had 14 saves.</p>\n<p>“There was a moment in the last game where she scored a goal from the cage which does not happen very often,” Head Coach Serela Kay explained postgame. “She stepped up and took a risk and that was definitely a turning point in that game for us. I think she played really well and the whole team felt the energy from that. I am looking forward to her continuing her high level of play.”</p>\n<p>Despite being one of the youngest teams in the conference, Santa Barbara has been able to find success against their top-ranked opponents behind the play of sophomore utility Sarah Snyder, junior utility Kate Pipkin and stud freshman attacker Mollie Simmons.</p>\n<p>“Pip does a good job of being a playmaker,” Kay pointed out. “She is very versatile and has a really high game IQ which is one of the reasons she can fill the role of the playmaker.”</p>\n<p>Snyder finished the regular season with 46 goals, which not only led the team but also ranked fourth in the Big West Conference. Pipkin had 39 goals and 33 assists on the year which gave her a total of 72 points on the year, which ranked fourth in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>“For Sarah, I talked about her being an inspiring player in the past, and I think she is still doing a great job of that,” Kay stated.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to continue to implement their patient play-style in the postseason as it worked extremely well in their last win against the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“I think allowing the game to develop is important,” Coach Kay highlighted. “Sometimes there are teams that if they rush too much, there are more errors on their part which means the other team does not have to necessarily do anything to get those errors to occur. We have focused on that and this team has done a good job of maturing into that.”</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos approach postseason play, they will look to follow the mantra that has led them to their successful season thus far, as they look to bring home a Big West title.</p>\n<p>“Work hard, be resilient and trust the process,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play Long Beach State at 12 p.m. this Friday, April 27, at the Anteater Aquatics Complex in Irvine.</p>\n<p>If they win their matchup with the 49ers, they will face No. 5 Hawaii on Saturday at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82725\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82725\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/","id":4875,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4874,4873,4872],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Seeks 4th-Straight Big West Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2018-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MTennis_vs_UCDavis_20180413_SiavashGhadiri-3-web_1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MTennis_vs_UCDavis_20180413_SiavashGhadiri-3-web_1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The search for Big West title No. 4 begins this week.

There, they will take on the winner of the UC Irvine-Hawaii match.</p>\n<p>On paper, Irvine seems to be the more likely opponent for UCSB. Despite only going 2-3 in conference play, they finished the season 15-11. In their matchup earlier this season, they defeated Hawaii 7-0.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara had the advantage of playing at home, where they finished the season 11-0, they were still able to dominate the Anteaters 7-0.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Gauchos leaned on their top three players: junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, sophomore Joseph Guillin and senior captain Simon Freund. In that particular match, all three players dominated, winning their matches in straight sets.</p>\n<p>If UCSB hopes to win the tournament, they will need those three to be on top of their game.<br>\nGuillin, a transfer from Florida, has been nothing short of spectacular in his first season as a Gaucho, earning a 19-2 dual match singles record. Freund has also been great, as he has won eight straight matches and earned a 15-5 mark in dual matches.</p>\n<p>Moreno de Alboran, ranked No. 76 in the country, has tallied a very solid 27-10 overall record and a 14-5 mark in dual matches. Being the only Big West player that has been ranked nationally, Moreno de Alboran will likely be invited to participate in the NCAA Singles Championships next month so long as he does not lose his ranking, giving him extra incentive to continue playing well in this tournament.</p>\n<p>Where Irvine gave the Gauchos some trouble, however, was at the lower courts, a place where Santa Barbara particularly struggled earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>On courts four and six, the Anteaters took UCSB to three sets, proving that they at least have the skillset to hang tight with them on those courts. Irvine is a talented team, and without the advantage of playing at home, the Gauchos will need to be on their A-game, especially since they will have had a day off already.</p>\n<p>If Hawaii beats Irvine, UCSB will be favored fairly heavily in that matchup. Despite only going 3-14 on the season, the Rainbow Warriors were able to eke out two conference victories, making them the fifth seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>While they once again had the advantage of playing in front of a home crowd, UCSB was in charge of their regular season matchup with Hawaii from start to finish. In fact, Santa Barbara did not drop a single set during the entire match.</p>\n<p>If UCSB can advance to the championship game, they will most likely have a rematch with Cal Poly in what was a very top-heavy conference this year.</p>\n<p>Just days ago, the Gauchos went into SLO and blanked the Mustangs 7-0 to take the regular season title.<br>\nThat being said, Cal Poly is an incredibly talented team, having gone 17-6 on the season and 4-1 in the conference.</p>\n<p>In their matchup, UCSB used the doubles point in order to nullify the home court advantage of Cal Poly. Led by the No. 85 duo in the country, Moreno de Alboran and junior Anders Holm, who eked out a win on court one 6-4, the Gauchos were then able to take that momentum into singles play, where they won every single match.</p>\n<p>That being said, Cal Poly is 17-6 for a reason, and their top three players all had excellent seasons.<br>\nJunior Josh Ortlip finished 14-4 on the season, and gave Moreno de Alboran a run for his money on court one.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to keep up the way they’ve played during their current eight-game winning streak if they are to extend their season. This has the makings of a team that could be dangerous in the NCAA tournament. First, however, they must get there.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play their semifinal match on Friday at 3 p.m. at Indian Wells. If they win that match, they will then play in the championship game on Sunday at 9 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

The 49ers boast a 36-9 holistic record on the season and have dominated Big West play with an 11-2 conference record, leading to them being the only conference representative in the NCAA Top 25.</p>\n<p>One only has to look at LBSU’s pitching staff to understand their dominance so far.</p>\n<p>Niners sophomore ace Cielo Meza took control of the Gauchos early in the series finale and hope seemed to diminish slowly as Meza was lights out on the rubber. The righty went 4.2 innings while allowing 2 hits,1 earned run, and 8 punchouts. She struggled with her location at times and offered up 8 walks in the process but kept Gaucho bats quiet otherwise.</p>\n<p>Meza improved her record to 20-3 on the season, now sporting a 1.39 ERA- both marks are good for the best in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>She continues to blow by batters by adding to her conference best strikeout total at 187 K’s on the year, 22 more punchouts than the next highest pitcher has this season.</p>\n<p>When the ‘Chos began to threaten after a couple of Meza walks in the fifth, Senior pitcher Jessica Flores trotted to the circle and took command of the final three innings.</p>\n<p>Flores picked up her eighth win on the season in game 2 on Saturday and came in to close out Sunday’s finale for her eighth relief appearance of the year.</p>\n<p>Flores continued the Niners dominance by allowing a mere two hits and no earned runs over 2.1 innings pitched. This improves her save total to 3 on the season, good for first in the conference as she shares the title with her fellow Niner teammate in Devyn Magnett.</p>\n<p>UCSB was unable to capitalize on Long Beach misses as the Gauchos left 12 base runners stranded, an almost extraordinary number against the stingy 49er pitching staff.</p>\n<p>This offensive inefficiency is not something that the Gauchos will be looking to replicate in their next series, as scoring only one run while being walked 10 times will not lead to many victories</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara struggled at the plate on Sunday, they managed to improve their effort on defense and erase the errors which have plagued them this year.</p>\n<p>With no outs in the top of the fifth, Long Beach junior shortstop Nichole Fry hit a shot into the gap in deep left center. Freshman left field standout Sammy Fabian robbed what was sure be an extra base hit as she laid out and made a spectacular diving catch to curb the Niners momentum and keep the Gauchos close.</p>\n<p>Fabian got the jump she needed as the ball left the bat and read it perfectly to close the gap just in the nick of time to make a premier snag on a ball that was dropping quickly. It seems that off the field work has made a difference as the year has worn on.</p>\n<p>“Lots of practice… we’ve been doing so much work, specifically on (gappers), so I saw it and just went for it,” Fabian answered postgame when asked about how she made the play.</p>\n<p>The freshman is leading the Gauchos in batting average and hitting .346 on the year. Not only is she prone to getting on base with a .403 on base percentage, but Fabian also possesses unique speed on the base path.</p>\n<p>She has stolen 9 bases this season, good for fourth most in the Big West Conference. Her stellar offensive play was definitely a bright spot for UCSB in an otherwise rough sweep.</p>\n<p>Fabian and the rest of the UCSB (17-28, 4-8) squad shift their attention to Cal State Northridge (18-32, 3-9) and a three-game away series in Los Angeles next weekend. The Gauchos have a doubleheader on Saturday, April 28 and will polish off the rest series on the following Sunday, April 29.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82668\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-23/no-18-49ers-complete-three-game-sweep-of-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82668\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-23/no-18-49ers-complete-three-game-sweep-of-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-23/no-18-49ers-complete-three-game-sweep-of-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-23/no-18-49ers-complete-three-game-sweep-of-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-23/no-18-49ers-complete-three-game-sweep-of-gauchos/","id":1265,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1264,1263,1262],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Long Beach State Rolls Over Gauchos In Sat.

However, come the second game, Long Beach pulled far ahead in a lofty 10-2 win.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State’s lineup consistently pressured the Gaucho defense in their most recent matchup, putting up runs in six of the seven innings. With four of their hitters batting .500 and over in the game, Long Beach accumulated 12 hits, a mixture of singles, doubles, and home runs.</p>\n<p>First baseman Taylor Rowland led her team offensively, going 2 for 3 at the plate.</p>\n<p>The sophomore has four RBI’s on the day, three of which came from her hefty homer in the sixth inning, increasing Long Beach’s lead from 6-1 to 9-1. Her high-range batting average sits tall at 0.381, but amongst her teammates only comes up to be the third highest.</p>\n<p>Statistically, Long Beach’s domination at the plate should not have come as a surprise to the Gauchos, not one of its girls’ batting average stoops below .240 in the ten-batter lineup.</p>\n<p>The team’s top two hitters, Naomi Hernandez and Nichole Fry, have a combined 121 hits in the overall season and both are sporting a stunning .400 averages. Each girl contributed two singles in the second game.</p>\n<p>Though admittedly it would not have changed the outcome of the game seeing as the Gauchos did not produce the baserunners they needed, UCSB turned in a lackluster defensive performance.</p>\n<p>With three errors, the girls indirectly allowed three unearned runs. They pushed through three different pitchers including sophomore Felisha Noriega who took the loss in the books for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The first game of the day, however, exposed a very different, much more competitive UCSB team than the series result indicates.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kept Long Beach State on its toes the entire game, holding them to only three runs up until the sixth inning while putting up two of their own.</p>\n<p>UCSB pitcher Emily Schuttish had the game on lock, practically shutting down Long Beach’s three biggest hitting threats previously mentioned. The freshman demonstrated control on the mound, allowing only a humble five hits. Schuttish holds the lowest ERA of the Santa Barbara pitching lineup at 2.81.</p>\n<p>The game as a whole was slow-moving, at a stand-still even for three of the seven innings.</p>\n<p>It was not until the sixth inning that the Gauchos gained some offensive momentum for themselves, scoring two of their three runs. Seven hits came out of the lineup, two more than their competitors.</p>\n<p>Junior Sierra Altmeyer showed poise at the plate, singling and doubling to come out of the game with a .666 average. So far in Big West, the second baseman has six RBI’s, the most on the team.</p>\n<p>It was not until the last inning that Long Beach State was able to pull out the win.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s right fielder and senior vet, Julia Lombardi, came out strong with a two-run homer that began and ended a two out rally for her team.</p>\n<p>From there, the Gauchos responded, promptly putting baserunners on in order to execute a traditional scoring method that got them just one run. After back-to-back outs to end the game, the Gauchos were left two runs short of a win.</p>\n<p>UCSB has one last shot at redemption today, Sunday, at 1pm where they look to conclude the series against Long Beach on a high note.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/long-beach-state-rolls-over-gauchos-in-sat-doubleheader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/long-beach-state-rolls-over-gauchos-in-sat-doubleheader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/long-beach-state-rolls-over-gauchos-in-sat-doubleheader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/long-beach-state-rolls-over-gauchos-in-sat-doubleheader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/long-beach-state-rolls-over-gauchos-in-sat-doubleheader/","id":1260,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[1259,1258,1257],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 12/5th-Seeded Gauchos Eliminated From Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2018-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MVolley_vs_UCI-041218-AngieBanks-05-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MVolley_vs_UCI-041218-AngieBanks-05-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's postseason hopes were dashed as fourth-seeded CSUN bested the Gauchos in four sets.

The matchup, a fifth-seeded UCSB going up against fourth seed CSUN.</p>\n<p>Considering the tournament’s single-elimination setup, this game would prove to be either the one to take the winning team to their next round opponent in No. 1 Long Beach State or be the last game of the season for the other side. Unfortunately, it didn’t go quite as planned for the Gauchos, as they dropped this matchup by a final result of 1-3.</p>\n<p>The competition got underway fairly evenly at first, as the Gauchos and Matadors went back and forth, keeping it tied all the way up to 12-12 in the first set. Then a small CSUN advantage was quelled as Santa Barbara fought back to keep it within 2 at 16-18.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Ultimately, the Gauchos would get outscored drastically around this halfway mark, as the Matadors went on to close out the set on 7 scores; compared to UCSB’s 2 scores past this point, it would essentially set up the set 1 loss for the Gauchos at a result of 18-25.</p>\n<p>UCSB then immediately picked up the pace and brought forward a strong performance for the closest set of the night. In the second, the Gauchos came out to a commanding lead as they opened 3-0 off an ace, error, and kill.</p>\n<p>They would go on to maintain this 4 point advantage all the way to a 9-5 score. The lead would eventually falter, however, as a flurry of errors halfway through the set forced them to call a timeout. Soon after, the Matadors’ newfound momentum was enough to bring it back level at 14-14.</p>\n<p>Things started to slow down at this point as both sides experienced lead changes and ties aplenty. Now into the late set numbers, both sides found themselves tied once more at 27-27.</p>\n<p>It seemed like it was anyone’s game at this point and it seemed to favor the Gauchos as they went up by a point following a CSUN service error. In the end, UCSB couldn’t make the most of the situation as a pair of CSUN kills and an opposing attacking error gave the Matadors the hard fought 30-28 win in set 2.</p>\n<p>Set 3 showed that the Gauchos came out to play with something to prove as they came out of the gates full speed in this one. Putting on perhaps one of their best sets of the entire season, UCSB started off with a comfortable 5-0 opening that soon turned into a 10-2 lead.</p>\n<p>It would pretty much remain at this immense gap as the Matadors just seemed lost and out of rhythm for most of it. The third set would then clearly go to the Gauchos as the final tally was a wide result of 25-12.</p>\n<p>With the momentum now in full swing, the Gauchos knew they’d take this set too if they replicated even half the level of play in the previous one.</p>\n<p>However, the Matadors had recollected themselves and returned to their former quality as both sides always kept it within a couple throughout the entirety of set 4. A half hour of exciting and competitive play later and spectators were biting their nails at the sight of a 26-26 score nearing its finale.</p>\n<p>Both sides played their hearts out and gifted volleyball fans a game to remember, yet the victor in this one was CSUN as a pair of back to back kills gave them the 28-26 win to close out the night.</p>\n<p>Game leaders included Gaucho junior outside hitter Corey Chavers who led all attackers with a whopping 21 kills. UCSB’s junior middle blocker in Connor Drake also put up a match-leading of 8 great blocks on the night.</p>\n<p>As this year’s men’s volleyball calendar now comes to a close, UCSB finishes with an 11-13 overall record on the year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/no-12-5th-seeded-gauchos-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/no-12-5th-seeded-gauchos-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/no-12-5th-seeded-gauchos-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/no-12-5th-seeded-gauchos-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/no-12-5th-seeded-gauchos-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament/","id":5563,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[5562,5561,5560],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Athlete Spotlight: Sophomore Pitcher Chris Lincoln","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sports Co-Editor Jorge Mercado was lucky enough to sit down with rising star Chris Lincoln just before the team heads to UC Davis for a huge conference tilt and get his thoughts on a variety of topics...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_76255\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"173849758\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82564\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76255\" data-attachment-id=\"76255\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/chris-lincoln-winds-up-to-pitch-nicolas-eitelbach-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1244&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1244\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Chris Lincoln winds up to pitch.

Luckily for everyone involved with the UCSB baseball program, Lincoln chose Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>We were also lucky enough to catch up with Lincoln before the Gauchos’ big series against UC Davis and had some fun; here are the best highlights from that interview.<strong> </strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Jorge Mercado:</strong> Where is your confidence level at this season and how has it been adjusting to the starting rotation?<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chris Lincoln:</strong> I have felt really good lately, I just stay grinding and try to keep everything in front of me. This is still a learning experience for me, and I know I still have a lot to learn, but I just want to put my team in the best position to win and I think I have done a decent job so far. It’s been a lot of mental focusing this year and trying to attack hitters more this season, and it’s paid off.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> What was the most fun of the recruiting process?</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>CL:</strong> First off, the recruiting process was really hectic. It is easy to get overwhelmed with it, but the most fun part was getting calls from these coaches from all these different schools. That first call or first text from a new coach that says they are showing interest in you is really enjoyable because all your hard work is paying off even before you turn 18. I sometimes wish I could go back and live it all again because it was so enjoyable, but I know I made the best decision in coming to UC Santa Barbara and I would never change that for the world.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> What got you into baseball and why did you stick with it?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I started playing when I was about four, and being athletic growing up I played all sports like football, basketball and track but there was something about baseball that I excelled at better. I was good at other sports, but I was just that much better as baseball and I rode that all the way to college and hopefully I could keep playing for a long time.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>JM:</strong> Is there a team you would love to play for at the next level?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> Honestly, growing up in Southern California, you see how much of a diehard fanbase the Dodgers have, and I would love to be a part of their organization. I would also love to play for the Yankees, and that would be a dream come true.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> If you could pick any other sport to play and be great at, what would it be?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I would pick basketball because I am kind of a flashy guy for the most part, and when you’re playing baseball and you’re on the field you have to reel it in a bit because baseball is more of a conservative game. If I was really good at basketball, it would be a bit easier to let my personality go and show my flashy side.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> If you could create the perfect pitcher, who would you model him after?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> He would probably look just like Clayton Kershaw because I just can’t think of anything wrong with him. I could breakdown a perfect pitcher, but honestly I would just end up breaking down Kershaw.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Do you play Fortnite? How good are you?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I just started getting into it, and I am much later than my friends because it didn’t look that enjoyable, but man, once you get into that first game, you just have to keep playing more and more, so I have been on it for a couple weeks now. I am so close to getting my first win and that makes it so much more agonizing because you keep getting top five, top three and then you make a simple mistake and lose. I will get there, though, and soon.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Favorite thing about UCSB and its culture?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I love the people. I mean the weather, the baseball team, all that is so great, but people and environment are so friendly and inviting. Everyone is so nice out here and they make it easy to fall in love with this place.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Favorite Andrew Checketts moment?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> Checks does not really have a big personality, he is pretty straight forward and serious a lot of the time, but there is one drill we do where us as pitchers, we have to try to make plays off him, and he is trying to beat us with the ball, and that is when his personality really comes out. He has gotten some good laughs out of me.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> What legacy do you want to leave here at UCSB?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I want people to remember me as a guy who was a model of what it looks like to be a pitcher. I want people to look back on me and tell the future generations of Gaucho pitchers that “that guy” is what it looks like to pitch here. I just want future pitchers to look back and say that’s the guy I want to be like.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 19th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Winner takes the regular season conference title and the top seed in the Big West tournament, while the loser must settle for the second seed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I feel we’re beginning to peak at the right time, with all of our biggest matches in front of us,” Gaucho Head Coach Marty Davis said.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Mustangs finished ranked No. 49 after an 18-8 season, the most wins in school history. With a victory over the Gauchos, the Mustangs would tie that record, putting their overall record at 18-5 heading into the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>Statistically, Cal Poly seems to have a strong advantage playing at home — on the season, they are 11-0 at home, while UCSB is only 3-5 on the road. However, most of those losses came earlier in the season, when Santa Barbara was struggling to find its identity. Additionally, UCSB holds the all-time record against Cal Poly, winning 19 of the 32 matches the two sides have played.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested to see how we play in front of a hostile environment,” Davis said. “I know we’re going to be up for the test.”</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate home-court advantage, Santa Barbara will have to win the doubles point — something that hasn’t been Cal Poly’s strong suit this season, particularly at the No. 1 spot. On the season, the Mustangs are just 7-9 at that spot; therefore, juniors Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm will look to pick up one of the two victories necessary for the doubles point.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Gauchos, the Mustangs are a top-heavy squad when it comes to singles play. Junior Josh Ortlip has dominated opponents at the one spot, winning 14 of his 18 matches and riding a four-game winning streak heading into the match. Moreno de Alboran, who remains unbeaten in his last seven matches and is ranked 80th in the country, will have to be on his A-game in order to get the victory.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Australian junior Dominic Bechard has won 11 of his 13 matches on court two, posing a threat to UCSB sophomore Joseph Guillin, who has only lost two matches the entire season. The top two courts will likely be the deciding factor on Saturday, so Guillin will have to keep his hot hand if the Gauchos are to win.</p>\n<p>Where the Mustangs have stumbled, however, is at the bottom two singles courts. On court five, Cal Poly has a 9-9 record on the season, while on court six they are 10-7. These numbers pale in comparison to the team’s overall record, and will likely provide the Gauchos’ best opportunity to pick up points.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB has also been inconsistent, especially at the number six position. On court five, freshman Victor Krustev has stepped up despite his age, winning his last two matches in straight sets. What remains to be seen, however, is who will play at the number six position for UCSB. After struggling earlier in the year, junior Hironori Koyanagi dominated in his last match, while senior Chase Masciorini picked up an easy victory on court six following a one year layoff of playing tennis. No matter who plays, Santa Barbara will need those points in order to have a cushion if their top players slip up.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt UCSB has the talent to keep up with Cal Poly — they’ve proved that all year. On the road, with the regular season title on the line, they will need to display that talent — along with the poise and confidence they’ve had of late — in order to celebrate a title in SLO.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on Cal Poly at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the Mustang Courts.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":8tg\" class=\"ajR\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\" aria-label=\"Show trimmed content\"><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 19th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
