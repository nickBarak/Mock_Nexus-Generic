Although four of their last seven conference games have resulted in close-scoring losses, the Gauchos’ intense level of play and ever-improving defense has demonstrated that they are ranked in the top six for a reason.</p>\n<p>“We need to keep our composure, and to really get to that next level we have to focus on our defense,” sophomore attacker Derek Shoemaker said. “I think that’s all it takes. We’re right there.”</p>\n<p>Last Sunday, the Gaucho defense was able to hold No. 1 Pacific within a two-goal range.</p>\n<p>A large contributor to their defensive success against Pacific was sophomore goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge with a total of 16 saves. Whitelegge is leading the MPSF with a total of 249 saves on the season and an average of 14.5 saves per game.</p>\n<p>“Chris makes up for a lot of defensive mistakes we make as a team,” Assistant Coach John Abdou said. “He is the backbone.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense is equally making its mark late in the season. In their last game against Pacific, the Gauchos recorded an equal scoring effort with goals from seven different players. Senior attacker Matt Gronow is currently leading the Gauchos with 54 goals on the season.</p>\n<p>UCLA has also had success late into the season with a 9-5 victory over Long Beach State last weekend.</p>\n<p>The Bruins dominated the 49ers offensively and freshman goalkeeper Garrett Danner led the defense to secure the win. Danner has recorded 190 saves so far during his freshman season.</p>\n<p>UCLA’s freshman attacker Lovre Milos is currently leading the Bruins with 36 goals on the season, followed close behind by junior attacker Paul Reynolds with 35 goals.</p>\n<p>This Sunday’s game will start at 11 a.m. and will air on the Pac-12 network.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/ucsb-heads-south-for-final-league-match-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/ucsb-heads-south-for-final-league-match-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/ucsb-heads-south-for-final-league-match-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/ucsb-heads-south-for-final-league-match-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/ucsb-heads-south-for-final-league-match-of-the-year/","id":5116,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5115,5114,5113],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season on the Line With Two Matches This Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895777307-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895777307-O.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Plays UC Davis and Cal State Northridge this weekend","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team is playing for its season this weekend as it travels to play at UC Davis Thursday and Cal State Northridge Saturday.</p>\n<p>Despite losing to No. 16 Hawaii last weekend, the Gauchos are still just one loss out of first place at 13-9 overall and 8-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>To stay in contention for a Big West title, this weekend’s games are critical for Santa Barbara.

The loss snapped an eight game winning streak, handing the Gauchos their first loss since late September.</p>\n<p>Up first for UCSB is Davis, a team that the Gauchos barely defeated 3-2 in a home match last month. The Aggies are one of only three teams in the conference to have upset Hawaii this year, and they have played well behind a strong offense this season.</p>\n<p>Leading the way are senior opposite Devon Damelio and junior middle blocker Victoria Lee. Damelio averages a team-high 3.08 kills per set while Lee leads the entire conference with a .406 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“UC Davis is a very good team and they play excellent defense,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need to be very patient and determined in finding ways to score against them.”</p>\n<p>In the match that could likely decide which team wins the Big West this year, UCSB takes on the second-best offense in the conference in the Matadors on Saturday. The Gauchos are sure to come in with confidence since they beat Northridge 3-0 back in October, holding the Matadors to a measly .170 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“Their offense and their setter really create things for them and they’re a very good blocking team,” Lantagne Welch said. “We had a pretty balanced offense against them last time and our defense was able to keep them below their averages.”</p>\n<p>The Matador’s junior libero Kelcie Randazzo averages 3.71 digs per set, good for fifth best in the conference. Northridge’s offense is extremely balanced with no players averaging over three kills per set and four averaging over 2.5. Setter Sydney Gedryn is third in the Big West averaging 10.39 assists per set.</p>\n<p>The emergence of middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg on the defense has been huge for UCSB as the season has progressed.

Finishing sixth and seventh overall in the Big West Championships while also being the only Gauchos to finish the 8k run under 26 minutes surely determines the expectations that they will have for this race.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be looking to these second-years to bring the team to victory this weekend.

Santa Barbara trailed late in the game, but forced overtime with a late goal and later prevailed on a penalty kick in overtime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara last played Saturday in front of a record 12,805 fans in a thrilling 2-0 victory against rival Cal Poly. The victory extended the Gauchos’ undefeated streak to 11 matches, as they have not lost since late September.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident about Friday more because of how we played against Cal Poly than the fact that six weeks ago we beat Northridge,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re in a good position. I’m supremely confident we’re in the NCAA Tournament based on where things are right now. This is a great time to be playing and it’s a great time because you spend all year for the games like Friday night.”</p>\n<p>Intensity will certainly be ramped up Friday night as both teams are battling for a position in the NCAA Tournament. UCSB looks to have secured a berth in the tournament, but Northridge may still be on the bubble and a victory could go a long way towards a postseason appearance for the Matadors.</p>\n<p>Northridge possesses a potent offense, ranking second in the conference with 40 goals this season, compared to third ranked Santa Barbara, which finished the season with 29 goals.</p>\n<p>“They play more of a kind of simple way of soccer. They look to counterattack with their fast outside forwards who can handle the ball really well and I think that’s how they’ve scored a lot of their goals this season,” freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely said. “We’re going to do our best to watch film and study how they play so we can be as best prepared for the offense as possible.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara possesses the top defense in the conference, allowing a mere 16 goals this season, meaning Friday’s matchup will pit a dangerous offense against a stingy defense.</p>\n<p>“We’re actually really excited because this is the second time playing them and the last time played them we won on a last-minute PK goal, so it’ll be interesting to play them again,” sophomore defender Marshall Cazares said. “They’re a good team, they’re probably the best team in the conference after us, so it should be a good game. We’re pumped.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has performed well this season and will make the NCAA Tournament at the end of the year, but is currently on the borderline of receiving a national seed ensuring a first round bye in the NCAA Tournament. A victory Friday or an outright Big West Tournament Title will strongly increase those odds.</p>\n<p>“Winning on Friday and getting into the Big West Tournament Finals would give us a for sure seed in the NCAA tournament, which is what we’ve based our season off of,” McNeely said. “That would be huge for us and a really big accomplishment so we’re looking forward to trying to get the win on Friday.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff Friday night at Harder Stadium is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52951\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52951\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/","id":1567,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1566,1565,1564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fifi Baiden: Ghana Born, Gaucho Bred","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.2.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-UCD-1.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.2.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-UCD-1.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Fifi Baiden has excelled at UCSB on the field and in the classroom.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Soccer for most is a hobby they pick up when young and drop by the time they hit high school.

Our parents wouldn’t be able to afford the education we needed,” Baiden said. “I got lucky to get selected to go to the academy at the age of 10. Right to Dream provided everything to help develop me as a player, and not just on the soccer field, but also a person through education.”</p>\n<p>After developing as a player and attending school, Baiden was presented with a remarkable chance to move to the United States through the academy.</p>\n<p>So, at the age of 15, Baiden left everything and everyone he knew and loved in Ghana for the opportunity to create a better life in America. The academy placed him at Dunn School, a private boarding school in Los Olivos, a mere 35 miles northwest of UCSB.</p>\n<p>During his time at Dunn, Baiden learned to value education and grew as a soccer player, earning team-MVP for three consecutive seasons while garnering interest from universities. Despite his immediate success, the transition from Ghana was not without its bumps.</p>\n<p>“When I got here it was hard for me to transition from Ghanaian culture to here. The accent was hard for me to adjust and my English wasn’t good,” Baiden said. “It was difficult but I had the support system around me when I got here to help me to learn and understand the culture.”</p>\n<p>In addition to playing for Dunn, Baiden also played for the Santa Barbara Soccer Club, leading to his discovery by UCSB.</p>\n<p>Once he stepped on campus at UCSB, Baiden immediately made his impact felt as a Gaucho, playing in 18 games as a true freshman and starting in seven. As a sophomore, Fifi increased his role even more, starting in all 23 games for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“He is responsible for directing our entire midfield, protecting our back four and at the same time linking up our midfield with the rest of our team,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “In my opinion, he plays the most important position on the field for us and does it at a very high level.”</p>\n<p>Baiden’s junior season really saw a takeoff in his game as he ended the season with All-Big West First Team honors along with a spot on the Big West Academic All-Conference Team. With a chance to go pro, Baiden decided to return to receive his degree and play his senior season, a campaign in which he was named All-Big West Second Team.</p>\n<p>“In terms of a teammate, he’s kind of evolved. He was very quiet his freshman and sophomore year,” Vom Steeg said. “Last year, by necessity, he became more of a vocal player and this year he’s the first one in the locker room to urge the guys and encourage them and get after guys. Players listen to him because we know what he’s meant for the program and what he’s done for the team.”</p>\n<p>With the soccer season approaching its end, Fifi is prepared to shift his focus from college to the professional leagues. Baiden will receive his Bachelor’s degree in Sociology in less than four years and begin the process to be drafted in the MLS this season after UCSB concludes its season.</p>\n<p>“He’s a player that in my opinion has the tools needed to play at the next level,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s going to get an opportunity to at least be on an MLS roster with a chance to make that team. Hopefully that happens, and I think it will. We’re pretty optimistic that he’ll get that chance.”</p>\n<p>Now with his status as a budding professional player, Baiden has also shifted his focus to helping the people in his native country. This past summer, Baiden returned to Ghana and saw his family for the first time since he was 15.</p>\n<p>“It was a really fun experience for me to go back to see my family and also to work at this orphanage to teach the kids and help them to value education and also run some drills to help them improve their soccer skills,” Baiden said. “My long-term goal is to actually be a humanitarian and travel around the world, going to impoverished communities trying to help in any way possible I can.”</p>\n<p>Due to the absence of modern technology in Ghana, Baiden was unable to communicate with his family frequently until they were finally able to afford a cell phone.</p>\n<p>As UCSB challenges for the Big West title and an NCAA postseason appearance this season, no player has been as vital to the team’s success than Baiden.</p>\n<p>“You look at two or three things that had to go well for us to be successful and having a healthy Fifi play all season and become a leader on this team through his play is certainly one of the key, if not the most important components of our success,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>It is not every day an individual has the courage to move across the world alone at the age of 15, possess the work ethic and determination to succeed on the field and in the classroom, and possess the humbleness to continue working towards aiding his native people through humanitarian efforts.</p>\n<p>Baiden’s journey to the United States pales in remarkability to all he has managed to and will continue to accomplish. And to think it all started with the kick of a soccer ball.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/","id":1566,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1565,1564,1563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dolphins’ Locker Room Antics Show Flaw in NFL","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A look at the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the NFL you are supposed to channel all your aggression and violence toward your opponent — not your teammate.

When someone work in an environment where racial slurs and threats are part of the norm, something needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>What is even more shocking is that teammates have come in support of Incognito, dismissing his threats and racial epithets.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has come to the defense of Martin and rightly so, because whatever locker room culture the Dolphins have created over the past years leading up to this situation is not normal — far from it.</p>\n<p>If the players of the Dolphins actually support Incognito and his use of racial slurs, then that says something about the nature of the Dolphins locker room and what exactly is allowed to go on in there. Not only that, it shows the lack of leadership on the team. If football really is a man’s game, it’s time for the Dolphins players to start acting like men.</p>\n<p>Ross has formed his own task force of former Miami Dolphin greats such as Don Shula, Dan Marino, Jason Taylor and highly respected NFL figures, such as former head coach Tony Dungy. Their job will be to analyze exactly what was going on in the Miami locker room and most importantly, establish a code of conduct for the team, because clearly the team is in need.</p>\n<p>For Ross, this is a step in the right direction not just for his franchise, but for all of the NFL, because if this is happening in one locker room it is more than likely happening to more teams.</p>\n<p>Expect NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to come down hard on the Miami Dolphins and that includes excessive fines and suspensions. Dolphins Head Coach Joe Philbin will likely be out of a job for being oblivious to what was going on in his own locker room and General Manager Jeff Ireland in all likelihood will also be out of a job.</p>\n<p>In his first sit-down interview, Incognito insisted he is not racist and did not apologize for his actions. Incognito has also said that Martin sent him messages with the same type of language. This is a poor defense to hide behind extreme behavior encouraged by teammates and does not justify his actions.</p>\n<p>The big picture is this — any type of bullying inside the locker room has no place in the NFL or any other sport for that matter. It is up to the Miami Dolphins organization and the NFL to correct this situation and prevent it from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>Martin is now currently in Los Angeles receiving counseling and a report came out yesterday that Martin wants to play professional football again, just not this year and of course not with the Dolphins. Though Martin is just 24 and a former second-round draft pick, the question to ask is which team will bring him in considering the potential risk he can bring to a team after seeing what the Miami Dolphins are now under.</p>\n<p>Some players will definitely be against the idea and many general managers would not like the distraction from the media Martin would bring. Until then, you can only hope that the league will be there for Martin because that was clearly missing in Miami.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/","id":3243,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3242,3241,3240],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jonathan Martin Wrong to Ditch His Teammates","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A look at the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Let me start by saying that the Miami Dolphins’ guard Richie Incognito should feel horribly guilty in his role regarding the pending-resignation of fellow offensive lineman and teammate Jonathan Martin. Evidence has come forward regarding Incognito’s harassment toward Martin, proving that the nine-year NFL veteran made vulgar, racist threats to the second-year pro. I don’t care what your line of work is; nobody deserves to put themselves in a hostile work environment where they feel their safety is in jeopardy. Racism and bigotry go beyond the boundaries of safety and are as open to condemnation as physical abuse and harassment. And of course nobody should be forced by others to attend “team meetings” at strip clubs and pay tabs that are not their own.</p>\n<p>But I propose that we put the most stock into the testimony of the teammates, and consider NFL locker room culture for what it is. Many of the most respected veterans on the Dolphins side with Incognito and want his suspension lifted. According to NFL Hall-of-Famer Cris Carter’s conversations with wide receiver Mike Wallace and center Mike Pouncey, Incognito is “loved” and “respected” by all his teammates. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill described Incognito as a “big brother” to Martin and “the best friend he had on the team.”</p>\n<p>And then one day, Martin cracked. After a lunchroom prank by Incognito, completely commonplace between teammates throughout the history of the NFL, Martin decided he no longer wanted to be the scrub and that he had enough. However, not once did he talk to Incognito or anyone else to express his frustration. He surprised his teammates, coaches and the league by quitting the team right before a big game and filing a formal complaint with the league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>By doing this, Martin committed multiple cardinal sins against his teammates, the ones who stand the most to lose from locker room dysfunction. He went to the media and exposed information regarding team chemistry without consulting any teammates. And HE QUIT AN NFL TEAM MID-SEASON, just because he got his feelings hurt. Abandoning your teammates for any reason within your control is far worse to a teammate than some expletive language and idle, empty threats. This behavior is despicable when acted out with sincerity and real malicious intent. But in the NFL, this kind of behavior between teammates is meant to build the mental toughness that is required in such a violent, crude, high-pressure and high-stakes job.</p>\n<p>An NFL field is a violent place by nature. Imagine 11 300-pound men trying their best to knock you out and injure you continuously for three hours. Then imagine every vile slur regarding you and your mother being spit at you while you try to counter this force. There is a reason that NFL rhetoric most resembles that of military personnel.</p>\n<p>I’m not proposing that Incognito had the right to do what he did. I’m proposing that Martin, as a fully-grown adult and an NFL player, should have a thick enough skin to stand up to Incognito and fight his battles himself. Martin is actually 10 pounds heavier than Incognito, so he has nothing to worry about as far as physical intimidation. Martin is also an educated man, a Stanford graduate who should be able to understand the context and disregard what would be considered bullying in any other line of work.</p>\n<p>Martin’s reaction could have been reflective of deeper-seeded issues. He has struggled on the field this year and lost his job as starting left tackle. If Martin has personal demons to battle before he is ready to play football again, he should take the time to sort those out and help himself get healthy. But he did not need to throw his best friend and teammate under the bus. Instead of being the bigger man and dealing with Incognito in a mature, adult manner, Martin left his team in shambles and now faces an uphill battle towards acceptance in any NFL locker room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus</p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of </em>The Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/","id":3240,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3239,3238,3237],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Hawaii as Win Streak Snapped","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776916-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776916-O.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB loses to Hawaii 3-2; eight game win streak napped","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team came into this past weekend with loads of confidence, despite the fact that they were playing the No. 12 team in the nation in Hawaii.

Hawaii improved its chances of staying in the Big West title race with the win and is now at 20-4 overall and 9-3 in the conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This loss really fires us up for the remainder of conference,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “This will be in the back of our minds, and now we’re just going to want to crush everyone.”</p>\n<p>The match did not get off to an ideal start for UCSB, who needed an early timeout after falling behind 9-4 in the first set. After the timeout, Santa Barbara looked like the dominant team its been the past six weeks, taking the lead thanks to an 11-3 run.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded points the rest of the way until freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt ended it with a kill, making it 25-22 and giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Hawaii dominated the second set, winning it 25-15, but neither team was able to take control for the rest of the match. In a tight third set, both teams traded points on the way to a 23-23 tie. UCSB finally broke away on the last two points thanks to a kill from sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau and a tremendous service ace from Thompson, giving them a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In a heartbreaking fourth set, a run of five straight points gave the Gauchos a 17-15 lead and put them on the verge of upsetting the Rainbow Wahine for the second time this season. Hawaii answered back with four straight points however, and held on to win the set 25-22.</p>\n<p>“I felt like we gave them a lot of early free points,” Lantagne Welch said. “But we played very well from about six points in to the rest of the way and put ourselves in a position to win it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB began the fifth and final set poorly, falling behind 7-4. However, three straight blocks by freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg evened the game at 7-7. However, the effort wouldn’t be enough, eventually losing 15-12.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine were led on offense by the combination of Hartong and senior setter Mita Uiato. Hartong picked up 24 kills and 10 digs on the night while Uiato had 45 assists.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at UC Davis this Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of November 12th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We can’t grind away like we did in the first two years. That’s not our team identity and personality this year. I like to score. When we can score and shut people down on the defensive end of things, we’ll be a pretty good team.”</p>\n<p>The team that ranked last in the Big West last year in points per game, at 51.3, used a high-pace offense and the fast break to tie the second-highest point total during the Carlene Mitchell era, scoring 76 points. The new run-and-gun style led to easy buckets as Santa Barbara shot an incredible 50.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We want to push the ball more because we feel like we’re conditioned,” sophomore forward Kendra Morrison said. “Our guards are stealing the ball higher up on the court, so it’s easier to get transition layups.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, in UCSB’s first home game of the year, the Gauchos got off to an extremely slow start offensively, scoring just nine points in the first nine minutes of the game. However, once Santa Barbara caught fire, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>In typical Gaucho fashion, UCSB used its defense to fuel its offense. With just under eight minutes remaining, Santa Barbara’s full-court press resulted in a 10-second backcourt violation by Occidental. A minute later, a steal by freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe led to two free throws, sparking a 14-0 spurt by the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Our defense got us pumped up,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware, who tallied four steals, said. “There was a lot of intensity when we were pressing. It just really got us going and helped the flow of the offense as well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the half on a 22-8 run to take a comfortable 39-26 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>Despite having only nine players on the roster, UCSB showed no signs of tiring entering the second half as it continued to get out on the break and beat its opponent down the court. The Gauchos started the second half on a 17-2 run, led by senior guard Destini Mason, who scored eight of her career-high 16 points during the run.</p>\n<p>With 11:31 to go, Santa Barbara held a 26-point lead, its largest of the game, scoring 55 points in the previous 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Overall, I was extremely proud of the effort,” Mitchell said. “There were three- and four-minute spurts where we were really good.”</p>\n<p>Three players finished in double-figures for UCSB.

With 24 seconds left, Pacific scored and solidified their victory with a final score of 11-9.</p>\n<p>“We missed a penalty shot and we missed our last power play,” Wigo said. “If you want to beat the No. 1 team in the country, you’ve got to do everything right.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the final score, the Gauchos demonstrated their level of play is equal with that of the top ranked team in the country.</p>\n<p>“I thought we came back and made a game of it,” Shoemaker said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play their last conference game of the season against UCLA next Sunday at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52896\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-narrowly-fall-to-no-1-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52896\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-narrowly-fall-to-no-1-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-narrowly-fall-to-no-1-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-narrowly-fall-to-no-1-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-narrowly-fall-to-no-1-pacific/","id":5115,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5114,5113,5112],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Finishes Warrior Princeville Makai Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Golf","publish_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos finish 14th out of 18 teams in Hawaii","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s golf team traveled to the Warrior Princeville Makai Invitational Tournament hosted by the Hawaii Makai Golf Course in Princeville, Hawaii from November 4-6.

On top of it all, UCSB concluded a spectacular undefeated regular season, making this the game of the year for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We made history, so we’re very happy about it,” senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko said. “We also knew our goal was to win conference, and we wanted to win it undefeated and we did. Now I hope we can go and, as a team, get our next goal and win the Big West tournament.”</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first half, the Gauchos came out firing in the second half and controlled much of the match. Boyoko gave the raucous crowd reason to celebrate in the 61st minute when he sent freshman midfielder Drew Murphy’s corner kick into the back of the net with a beautiful header in traffic to give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Boyoko was not done however, as he helped UCSB gain a 2-0 advantage in the 86th minute to ice the game. Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez sent a through ball to Boyoko who then crossed it to Charlie Miller as the sophomore forward sent a shot past a diving Cal Poly goalkeeper to ensure UCSB would come away victorious on such a special night.</p>\n<p>“The fans did a great job coming out, and so we came prepared to make sure we got a win and to enjoy the moment,” senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “It’s not every time that you get that kind of atmosphere. We really appreciate the opportunity and we felt this was a moment we had to get the win to enjoy with our fans.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly lost its second consecutive match and finished in third place in the Big West North.

After going down by 16 in the second half, UCSB finally found its stride and was able to tie the game with less than two minutes to go. However, the comeback effort wasn’t enough.</p>\n<p>“Overall I felt pretty good about [the game]” Nesbit said. “I think we did some good things. Unfortunately, and this is something we struggled with last year, we couldn’t put two halves together. We were two completely different teams in the first half and second half and once we learn how to put those halves together we’re going to be pretty good.”</p>\n<p>One of those positive elements was the Gauchos’ offense as they did receive offensive contributions from everyone on the roster, with Nesbit leading the way with 15 points, seven rebounds and six assists.</p>\n<p>“At first it was like ‘oh my god we just lost,’” senior guard Destini Mason said. “But after really thinking about it and seeing how young we are, I started to see more positive things. I think we’re a better offensive team than we were last year.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit is one of three seniors this season that highlight the Gaucho squad. Senior guard Melissa Zornig, who was also in double-figures Monday with 13 points, led the team last year in three point percentage at 32.5 percent. And Mason serves as the versatile defensive stopper for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“With me, Mel and Dest, we all lead, but we lead in different ways,” Nesbit said. “We all have very different personalities so us coming together and understanding what we want out of ourselves as well as out of our team, it’s going to be really good because there are different dynamics.”</p>\n<p>The focus for Santa Barbara this weekend will be defense after allowing Vanguard to shoot 49.0 percent from the field. A team typically known for their tenacious defense, last season the Gauchos held their opponents to just 52.4 points per game, the best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It comes down to defense,” Nesbit said. “With Vanguard, we were bad one on one. That’s something we’ve worked on this week in practice and it’s going to be key throughout the year because we’re fast and we need to use that to our advantage. We need to be disciplined on that end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>As for the opponent, this will be Occidental’s first game of the year. The Tigers lost their star to graduation last season in forward Makenzie Brandon, who averaged 21.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>Of the returners, the leading scorer from last year is senior forward Elizabeth Messick . Messick averaged 10.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per game last season and at 6’3’’ could be a problem against a shorter UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>“We don’t see an opponent’s jersey,” Nesbit said. “It’s always about being the best player you can be and the best team we can be. Once you get that in your mind, no one is going to be able to stop you.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52876\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52876\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/","id":608,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[607,606,605],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry Part Two","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-29.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-29.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces rival Cal Poly in a televised match.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em></em>Anytime UCSB and Cal Poly meet up on the pitch, excitement and madness are guaranteed to ensue.

With that many fans in attendance, Blue-Green rivalry games are always noted for the booming crowds and hectic cheers aimed at the rival team.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important [to win] because we know we are a better team than them and we have to show that on Saturday,” Jome said. “A win against them, in hopefully a packed Harder Stadium, is the perfect way to end our regular season heading into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also has an opportunity to become the second team in history to finish a Big West season undefeated in conference play if they can win or tie against Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We’re obviously undefeated so we want to go into that game and make sure we take care of business, get the three points and then we’ll move on from there,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “So far it’s good, we’re still undefeated nine games in now.”</p>\n<p>With a victory or tie on Saturday, UCSB would also have home field advantage throughout the Big West Conference Tournament, clinching the top record in the entire conference.</p>\n<p>By clinching the Big West North, Santa Barbara has already secured a first round bye in the Big West tournament as well as home field advantage through the semifinals.</p>\n<p>Despite a scoreless draw against Sacramento State on Wednesday, the third-straight tie for UCSB, the Gauchos are primed to enter the NCAA postseason once again this year, regardless of the results of the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>“It was tough. We wanted to go out there and beat Sac State to get our RPI high and everything,” Baiden said. “We didn’t lose but at the same time we wanted a win against Sac State.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match features some high scoring offenses as Cal Poly leads the entire nation in goals scored and features a deadly weapon in senior forward Mackenzie Pridham who ranks second in the nation with 14 goals this season.</p>\n<p>When UCSB faced Cal Poly earlier this season, the Gauchos’ defense held Pridham scoreless in an impressive defensive effort by freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the ball, UCSB ranks third in the Big West in goals scored, but is well suited to slow down Cal Poly as the top ranked defense in the league, allowing only 16 goals this season. The Mustangs, however, rank last in the conference with 28 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be an important game for both teams,” Baiden said. “We lost against them last year so we’re going to make sure we don’t repeat that. We’re going for the win and trying to finish the season strong, going undefeated and winning against Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green Rivalry at Harder Stadium is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. and will be televised on Fox Sports West.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of November 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/","id":1594,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1593,1592,1591],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host No. 12 Hawaii in Battle of Big West Contenders","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5D3_5353.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5D3_5353.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts Hawaii in a rematch of a major upset earlier this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When the UCSB women’s volleyball team came into Hawaii in early October, it was a sub-.500 team with a new coach in search of an identity. The Rainbow Wahine had been undefeated in conference since entering the Big West last season, and a scrappy Gauchos’ squad appeared to be no threat to the dominant team that was ranked No. 3 in the nation.</p>\n<p>Now, less than a month later, UCSB is near the top of the Big West, sitting just a half game back from Cal State Northridge for first place. At 13-8 overall and 8-1 in conference, the Gauchos have turned it on lately. They are going for their ninth-straight win this weekend against No. 3 Hawaii, who they beat earlier this season by a score of 3-2 in one of the most thrilling matches they have played in years.</p>\n<p>After the loss to UCSB, the Rainbow Wahine stumbled further by losing two straight Big West matches on the road a week later. Now, the once unstoppable and unanimous choice to win the conference finds itself dreadfully sitting in third place with a record of 18-4 overall and 7-3 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s going to be a really tough match but we’re looking forward to it,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “They’re going to be coming in really fired up because we broke their streak and beat them in their place, so we know we’re going to get their best game.”</p>\n<p>Possessing one of the best offenses in the nation, Hawaii leads the conference in every important offensive stat including kills, kill percentage, assists per set and points per set.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to be ready for them and play at a really high level,” Lantagne Welch said. “We’re really looking forward to that challenge and having the opportunity to play in front of our home crowd and hopefully a great environment.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for the Rainbow Wahine as always is senior outside hitter Emily Hartong, who leads the Big West with 4.65 kills per set. Setting her up is senior setter Mita Uiato, who is first in the conference averaging 10.88 assists per set.</p>\n<p>“They are a good hitting team,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “We need to make sure we serve them tough so they won’t be able to execute their offense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ counter for Hartong is Thompson, who averages a second-best 3.49 kills per set. The last time these two teams met, she played one of her best games this season with a team-high 19 kills and an astounding 10 block assists.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has been picking up the wins, they have not done so with any kind of remarkable offensive stats. Staying disciplined may be the number one reason why the Gauchos are 8-1 in the conference as they have accumulated the lowest amount of errors in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB finds its strength in its defense, which held Hartong and the entire Hawaii offense to just a .111 hitting percentage in October. Freshman Phoebe Grunt has quickly found her place as one of the best middle blockers in the conference, averaging a Big West leading 1.17 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>“Our confidence is definitely higher than the first time we played them,” Thompson said. “At the same time we need to make sure we have the same determination in order to win.”</p>\n<p>Anchoring the middle at libero for the Gauchos is the invaluable senior Leah Sully, who has now risen to fourth in the Big West with 3.69 digs per set. If the Gauchos fall behind, Sully may be asked to play her more favored position of outside hitter as she did in a come-from-behind win against UC Davis several weeks ago.</p>\n<p>However, the Rainbow Wahine may have the advantage in the form of senior libero Ali Longo, who leads the Big West with 332 digs this season.</p>\n<p>The match will be played Saturday at 6:30 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em></em>Daily Nexus <em>File Photo.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52863\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52863\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/","id":5283,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5282,5281,5280],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":141,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
