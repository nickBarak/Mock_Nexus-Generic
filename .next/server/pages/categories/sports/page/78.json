To this point, it has only registered a 6-9-1 record away from home. UCSB’s last series against a conference opponent on the road ended with them surrendering all three games to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>To its credit, however, the Gauchos won their last game on the road, at St. Mary’s, in an 11-inning thriller that ended with a final score of 4-3.</p>\n<p>This season, UC Davis has taken a step back from last year in which it finished 30-26-1. With two or more losses in its final 14 games, it would already have more losses than it did a year ago. However, the Aggies are currently riding their longest winning streak of the season, which is ongoing at four.</p>\n<p>These two teams met a year ago in Santa Barbara with the home team registering the sweep. Still, all three games were close with two of them ending in a one-run victory for the Gauchos. UCSB has not lost a game in Dobbins Stadium since in the Andrew Checketts era and has won the last five series against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>In conference games this season, the Aggies have been in the middle of the pack ranking fifth in on-base percentage (.339), sixth in batting average (.262) and seventh in slugging percentage (.344).</p>\n<p>Big hitters for UC Davis include senior outfielder Cameron Olsen who leads the team with 23 RBI, home runs (3), batting average (.337), on-base percentage (.404) and slugging percentage (.609).</p>\n<p>He is helped by junior Mark Cardinalli who ranks ninth in the conference in batting average with a .327.</p>\n<p>However, one major problem for the Aggies is their earned run average which ranks dead last, ninth, in the conference at 6.99.</p>\n<p>Big time Gaucho hitters will look to take advantage of that mismatch and attack early and often. UCSB is led by sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in batting average (.326) and RBI (32) which also ranks 10<sup>th</sup> and fifth in the conference respectively.</p>\n<p>Catcher Dempsey Grover is another top-20 hitter in conference in batting average which is currently at .309. Redshirt sophomore infielder J.J. Muno has also been solid for the team ranking second in hits (42) and tied for first in home runs (4).</p>\n<p>UCSB also has two of the better pitchers in conference with junior Shane Beiber (8-2) and sophomore Kyle Nelson (6-0). Nelson currently holds the best ERA in the conference, 36<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA, with a 1.80 ERA and his 59 strikeouts are 12<sup>th</sup> best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Beiber ranks first in the conference in wins with eight, tying a career high, eighth in the Big West in strikeouts (59) and 13<sup>th</sup> in ERA (3.12).</p>\n<p>This is a big weekend for the Gauchos as they have the opportunity to keep moving up the conference rankings with a series against one of the weaker opponents they will face this season. They also need to prove they can win away from their impenetrable home fortress.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces UC Davis starting Friday, May 8 at Dobbins Stadium at 2:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday’s game are at the same location and both are at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Clark ended the 2014 season leading in almost every offensive category, finishing with 25 stolen bases, four triples and a .505 slugging percentage. These incredible numbers would earn her Big West Freshman of the Year, First Team-All Big West and Honorable Mention All-Pacific Region.</p>\n<p>Clark began playing softball at the early age of six when her parents signed her up for tee-ball. Her interest in softball was sparked through her older sister, whom she watched play for a year before deciding to pick up the bat herself.</p>\n<p>While Clark’s older sister provided an inspiration for her growing up, she also admired watching pro baseball players, as baseball is one of her favorite sports to watch. There is one player in particular however, who really stands out to Clark.</p>\n<p>“I really admire Adrian Beltre. I grew up as a Dodgers fan back when he was playing for the Dodgers, and I liked the way he would just take a hack,” Clark said.</p>\n<p>Taking a hack would be the motto for Clark as she improved her batting average from a .407 to .438 percentage by the end of her high school career at Monte Vista High School. Before attending Monte Vista High, Clark attended The Woodlands High in Woodlands, Texas where she would have a freshman season much like the one that she would experience later at UCSB.</p>\n<p>While only a freshman in high school, Clark led her team to a district title and was named the district’s Freshman of the Year. She also earned herself a spot on the district’s all-first team and all-academic team.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70636\" style=\"width: 243px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70636\" data-attachment-id=\"70636\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/feat-softball_vsgeorgiatech-20160227-dustinharris-6-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70636\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=233%2C350\" alt=\"After bunting the ball, Kristen Clark prepares to run to first base.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Although softball plays a huge part in Clark’s life, academics have always been a priority. Clark was an honor roll student during all four years of high school, while also being a member of the National Honors Society, the California Scholarship Federation and the French Honors Society. Fortunately, Clark ended up at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of factors that made me choose UC Santa Barbara. Academics was a big thing as well as the athletics part, because I’m a biology major and they obviously have a great program here,” Clark said. “There was a time when I wanted to stop by the campus and look at it, and I got a gut feeling like, ‘wow, I can see myself being here for four years,’ because it’s gorgeous, and I really liked all the coaches in the program.”</p>\n<p>Since making the decision to attend UCSB, Clark has experienced nothing but success on the softball field. In her sophomore year during the 2015 season, Clark was named Second Team All-Big West, tallying the third-most hits in Gaucho history and leading the team with 69.</p>\n<p>Clark also finished the season with a team high nine stolen bases. Throughout conference play, Clark improved her batting average from a .356 to .382 which ranked her sixth in the league.</p>\n<p>Clark’s ability and determination to improve, whether it’s small or large improvements, is at the precipice of her game. Since the beginning of her high school career, Clark has managed to better her softball abilities and improve her game.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been more of a get on base type of batter,” Clark explained. “And so this past year I’ve really tried to get a bit more power. Against Riverside I hit an over the fence home run so that was a big step for my hitting and offense.”</p>\n<p>Setting such high goals for herself has developed Clark into one of the team’s strongest and most powerful hitters. This year Clark has continued to dominate most offensive categories, leading the team with a .420 batting average, ranking her third in the conference, and an excellent .480 on base percentage.</p>\n<p>She also leads the Gauchos with 37 runs scored this season, and 17 stolen bases, ranking her seventh in conference standings. Since the beginning of Clark’s softball career at UCSB, Clark has inspired her teammates with not only her numbers at the plate, but her drive and determination to succeed both on and off the field. As a junior, she will have huge expectations put on her by the team for her next year.  There is little doubt that Kristen Clark will be ready to meet the challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of

breeze through the first round of the NBA Playoffs, teams not participating in the postseason continue to watch from afar and prepare for yet another offseason.</p>\n<p>Despite their playoff shortcomings, the time off is still valued as teams are able to learn from their most recent miscues in hopes of making a top eight conference finish the following season. For some NBA teams, the road to success may be more challenging than others, but for a franchise like the Sacramento Kings, the 2017 year could very well stand as their opportunity for growth.</p>\n<p>As the Kings bid farewell to the aging Sleep Train Arena, a home court that has hosted 28 seasons and nested three memorable Pacific Division titles, a pure sense of optimism emanates for its fans in welcoming their new state-of-the-art facility, the Golden One Center.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Looking to spark fan engagement and put Sacramento back on the map, Ranadivé assembled a plan that would get the Kings back on their feet.</p>\n<p>Pairing up with the City Council of Sacramento, an approved vote helped set forth the $507 million dollar deal for the Golden One Center. Set to open just in time for the upcoming NBA season this October, this fresh arena will surely energize a city that has been deprived of winning basketball.</p>\n<p>At 779,000 square feet, up to 19,000 in seating and located in the heart of downtown Sacramento, the Golden One Center acts as an ideal and enticing venue for excitement, culture and live entertainment.</p>\n<p>Ranadivé has also caught the attention of more renowned sports organizations with this newly implemented arena.</p>\n<p>The California Interscholastic Federation and the NCAA have both agreed to make the Golden One Center home of the CIF State Basketball Championships as well as the first two rounds of the NCAA Men’s Division I Tournament.</p>\n<p>With a prime location, a host to iconic sporting events and state-of-the-art facilities that ensure optimum levels of enjoyment, the Golden One Center will not only rejuvenate this urban metropolitan area but also its loyal Kings’ fans.</p>\n<p>While the city of Cleveland seeks its first NBA championship and the Warriors look to neatly wrap up an already historic season, the Kings also have their own goal in mind of rekindling a winning culture.</p>\n<p>Still nostalgic from the early 2000s and in search of a new identity, the Golden One Center will offer the fresh start this NBA franchise eagerly needs. Coming early October, history will be made and the city of Sacramento will embark on a “New Era of Proud.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 5, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=888%2C185\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"888\" height=\"185\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They have also gutted out some tough victories as three of the last five have been decided by one run, including the game against St. Mary’s, which went 11 innings, their second longest match of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB displayed a solid performance in both sides of the field and was able to pick up its 30th win of the season for the fourth consecutive year. This is only the second time in program history that the team has accomplished this feat, with the last time coming during the 1982-1987 seasons.</p>\n<p>It was a great sight in the first inning of the game to see redshirt junior pitcher James Carter get his first action since coming back from Tommy John surgery last season.</p>\n<p>“I was excited to see him [Carter] back,” Checketts said. “It was good to see him pitch good as well.”</p>\n<p>The right-hander only went one inning, but it sure was a strong one, allowing one hit, no runs and also striking out one of the Waves’ best hitters in junior Manny Jefferson.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous through the first couple of guys, but then I settled in and felt confident after that,” Carter said.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of that inning, the Gauchos started quick, taking an early 1-0 lead as the first three hitters all got singles with the latter batter. Redshirt sophomore left fielder Josh Adams ripped an RBI single thanks to a great hit to left field, scoring redshirt junior center fielder Andrew Calica and moving sophomore short stop Clay Fisher to second.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Kyle Hatton stepped in after Carter’s solid inning and allowed only one hit in the second and third inning combined. In the fourth, however, Pepperdine tied the game at one thanks to Jefferson’s 11th home run of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would respond in the bottom of the fifth inning, adding two runs and going up 3-1 after freshman Tevin Mitchell scored on an error by the Waves and Fisher’s RBI single down center field and scoring Calica.</p>\n<p>UCSB added to its lead in the next inning after freshman catcher Sam Cohen, in his ninth game of the season, hit an RBI double to right field, scoring teammate Devon Gradford and giving his team the 4-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Just as the Waves looked like they were done for the night, junior outfielder Matt Gelalich hit an RBI single in the seventh frame that just got by the Gauchos’ first baseman and cut the lead to two runs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the eighth inning with one out, senior first baseman Brad Anderson hit a solo shot home run off of Trevor Bettencourt, who had just replaced Hatton, that again brought Pepperdine close to tying the game, which was now 4-3.</p>\n<p>The Waves would have tied the game, but thankfully the redshirt junior Bettencourt caught junior Aaron Barnett off guard and was able to pick him off at first for the team’s first out. Had that not happened, Anderson’s homer would have been a two-shot and the game could have ended differently.</p>\n<p>Bettencourt was the pitcher who let down his team down in the Gauchos’ only home loss of the season to St. Mary’s after giving up five runs in the eighth frame of that game.</p>\n<p>After the homer and accidently hitting Jefferson and the head putting him on first base, the right-hander did not look afraid of the situation and showed his skills, striking out redshirt sophomore Ben Rodriguez and forcing sophomore Lambert Chase into a fielder’s choice for the final out of the inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did nothing in the bottom of the eighth and relied on its defense to finish off the game. After two easy outs, Pepperdine made the game interesting, ripping off two singles and having runners on first and second.</p>\n<p>Calica, the team’s great center fielder, made an impressive catch by tracking the ball on a hit that looked like it was about to go over his head for the final out, and sealed the 4-3 victory and 17th straight home win.</p>\n<p>Although the win was not the most impressive of the Gauchos’ season, it still was a win nonetheless, and it again displayed the team’s ability to grind tough wins as they are now 11-1 in one-run games.</p>\n<p>Pitching-wise, Hatton was fantastic, picking up his third win of the season after going six innings and allowing five hits and two runs while striking out a career-high 10 batters.</p>\n<p>“Kyle Hatton was great with his three pitches,” Checketts said. “He has a sort of invisible fastball. It never breaks 80 [mph], but no one can hit it.”</p>\n<p>In terms of pitcher James Carter, UCSB will continue to monitor him with care and make sure he is progressing steadily as the season heads into crunch time.</p>\n<p>“He will get more pitches each time he’s out there and we will continue to see how he feels,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be throwing next week, and each week my pitch count will go up, and I’m excited about that,” Carter added.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next series will be against UC Davis at Dobbins Baseball Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The team also boasts a 20-1 overall home record on the season, another program record.</p>\n<p>The Waves heads into its second match-up of the season against the Gauchos with a respectable 20-18 record and a 10-8 conference record. Pepperdine already coasted by Santa Barbara once this season winning the March 29 match 6-2, at home.</p>\n<p>These two teams have already met once before with the aforementioned victor being the Waves. Although Santa Barbara has been almost unbeatable at home, however, on the road it has struggled mustering a 6-9-1 record which could have played a factor in the last game.</p>\n<p>“They took it to us a bit at there place.” Clark said. “We just got to come out swinging and play better.”</p>\n<p>Another big factor in the late march match-up was redshirt junior infielder Matt Crowder who went 3-4 (.750) on the day and scored one run that gave Pepperdine the 3-2 advantage and the team never looked back.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Matt Bernard also had a solid outing going 1-2 (.500) with one RBI and two runs.</p>\n<p>As an entire staff, Pepperdine’s pitching was on point surrendering only five hits and two runs through the nine innings, with sophomore Matt Green picking up the victory after allowing only two hits and no runs in 3.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>During the course of the season, the Waves have gotten great performances from junior Manny Jefferson who leads the team in RBI (33), home runs (10), hits (44) and slugging percentage (.579). The infielder won West Coast Conference Player of the Week two weeks ago after hitting four home runs during the week.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine also has one of the best pitchers in D1 NCAA baseball in A.J. Puckett. The junior is fifth in the NCAA in ERA (1.01) and has not allowed an earned run in his last seven starts and 54.2 innings — the longest streak of any pitcher this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to its slew of hitters to help take care of the Waves good pitching staff which has been solid all season posting a 3.99 team ERA which ranks 88th in the country out of 295.</p>\n<p>Big time hitters to watch out for will be sophomore Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (32), hits (44) and slugging percentage (.508). Sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover is another solid hitter batting .309, third best on the team, and is coming off a solid five-RBI weekend.</p>\n<p>Another interesting storyline will be the return of redshirt junior James Carter who will be the starting pitcher tomorrow. The right-hander will see his first action this season after rehabbing from Tommy John Surgery.</p>\n<p>“We are excited to see him come back for us.” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “He was a solid closer for us last year and we will see what happens.”</p>\n<p>Last season he earned the honors of being the teams closer and registered five saves and one win in seven appearances allowing six hits and no earned runs in 9.2 innings pitched while also striking out 12 batters.</p>\n<p>The California native did not appear in a game after March 6 due to injury but was still taken in the 27th round of the 2015 MLB First-Year Player Draft by the Houston Astros before ultimately deciding to come back to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He was drafted even though he was injured and I think that is a testament to how good he was,” Coach Checketts said. “It will be interesting to see how he comes back, overall we are excited.”</p>\n<p>While it is unclear how long Carter will pitch, what is clear is the hope that he can bounce back well from his injury and help a pitching staff that, although is solid, is a bit short staffed and could use some help.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have already avenged a loss against a team it lost to early in the year which was St. Mary’s and will hope to do the same against Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Not only would they avenge an earlier loss, but a win against the Waves would improve an already great season and would extend a record that is ongoing.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s faces off against Pepperdine today at Ceasar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m. in hopes of improving its 16 game home winning streak.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Rainbow Warriors have now lost their last five games.</p>\n<p>This sweep was yet another achievement for the Gauchos as they have now won all five home weekend series, continue their best home start in school history (20-1) and now have swept two conference opponents, a task that is never easy.</p>\n<p>“It’s great to have these opportunities to sweep.” Checketts said. “In baseball in general its hard [to sweep]. We did not play great baseball but the guys hung in there and got a win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to clinch the sweep of Hawaii in style winning Sunday’s game in walk-off fashion that had fans and players out of their seats when they saw the collision at home plate that won the game 5-4.</p>\n<p>Hawaii began the scoring in this ball game as in the first inning senior Jacob Sheldon-Collins hit an RBI single giving his team the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded quickly as catcher Grover Dempsey tied the game at one after hitting a fielder’s choice RBI. An RBI triple by sophomore infielder J.J. Muno made the score 2-1 in favor of UCSB after two innings.</p>\n<p>In the fourth inning, the Rainbow Warriors were able to score two runs to retake the lead at 3-2 after a home run by freshman infielder Ethan Lopez and an RBI double by senior Matt LoCoco. Hawaii added one run in the fifth to go up 4-2 after five innings.</p>\n<p>As it had done all season, Santa Barbara fought back and in the sixth inning tied the game up at four after a sac fly by sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher, and an RBI single from Muno.</p>\n<p>The game then got really interesting in the final inning of play. With one out and runners on first and second the Gauchos called upon freshman Noah Davis, who had been struggking with a toe injury, to get them out of this jam.</p>\n<p>He didn’t look so hot at first as after an errant pitch, both runners were able to steal a base and now were in scoring position. Davis then walked the batter making it bases loaded for junior Marcus Doi.</p>\n<p>The freshman broke from his shaky start and pitched it well against Doi, eventually making him hit a grounder that the Gauchos were able to convert into a double play and get them out of the inning unscaved.</p>\n<p>“That double play was big for us.” Checketts said. “Noah [Davis] coming in and making that pitch on his bad toe.”</p>\n<p>The game still tied at four, the Gauchos now had a chance to win it in the bottom half of the final frame. Senior Ryan Clark wasted no time getting on base with a single, then stealing second to get into scoring position.</p>\n<p>After a bunt by redshirt junior Andrew Calica, Clark was now on third base while the Gauchos only had one out so they were in perfect position to win the game.</p>\n<p>Freshman Michael McAdoo had the honors of trying to seal a victory for his team and did just that hitting a fielder’s choice RBI. His hit was a short one that was quickly grabbed by the shortstop who threw it home in hopes of getting Clark out.</p>\n<p>“A backbreaker for them.” Checketts said. “We got a green read at third so we are going on contact and the catcher just missed it. Tough break for them, great break for us.”</p>\n<p>The two players, Clark and freshman catcher Kekai Rios, collided as the senior slid at home base for the win. Rios was unable to handle the ball while also taking a punishing hit and thus the Gauchos won in tremendous walk-off fashion.</p>\n<p>“He was blocking the plate pretty good so I knew I had to go in real hard and luckily he missed the ball.” Clark said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would only need walk-off win in Sunday’s game as the Saturday’s and Friday’s games were much easier wins for the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB put together a great eighth inning scoring three runs which led to its solid 6-3 victory and made history as it was their 15<sup>th</sup> consecutive home win, a school record that now stands at 16 after Sunday’s win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked good early scoring two runs in the third inning to take a solid 2-0 lead after three. Hawaii responded as Doi’s RBI double and Lopez’s two RBI single gave the Rainbow Warriors a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied the game up at three after an error by Hawaii allowed Muno to score the tying run.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth, Dempsey gave his team a 4-3 lead after hitting a solo shot to left field. Muno would then score on a wild pitch and Calica added one final run hitting a sac fly to score teammate Fisher, giving the Gauchos a 6-3 lead.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt shut down Hawaii in the ninth and made sure no comeback was possible and secured the 6-3 victory. The right hander allowed only one hit in three innings of play.</p>\n<p>After the win, the Gauchos were happy to make history and break a record that had stood for so long but were aware that this was not enough.</p>\n<p>“We got a good group of dudes and I’m happy about that.” Clark said. “This is cool but we just have to keep winning no matter where we are.”</p>\n<p>The win was big in a slew of fashion, not just for breaking the school record, but it also marked the first time UCSB had won a series at home against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“They’re a really good team.” Clark said. “No matter the situation, our guys stay cool and find a way to win. I’ve never experienced something like this before.”</p>\n<p>Before achieving two feats on Saturday, the Gauchos beat down the Rainbow Warriors, thanks to sophomore Austin Bush’s performance, 14-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was scoring at a ridiculous pace early on scoring 11 runs in the first five innings of the ball game. Big performances were seen from Bush who’s two run homer in the bottom of the first inning gave his team the 2-1 lead and they never looked back.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the day Bush went 3-5 (.600) with five RBI’s, two runs, and one home run.</p>\n<p>“He was great for us.” Checketts said. “He has a great swing and he made great contact.”</p>\n<p>Despite going 1-4 (.250) on the day, Grover’s one hit was a home run that scored three runs for the Gauchos in the bottom of the fourth frame giving his team a commanding 8-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Pitching wise junior Shane Bieber (8-2) had another solid outing for his team pitching seven innings and surrendering only six hits and one run while striking out seven batters. The righty has now won eight games this season tying his career high.</p>\n<p>“Bieber was really solid game for us once again. He’s a really solid pitcher.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend was another great one for the Gauchos. Not only in terms of breaking records but also in the fact that it did not let the sweep by Cal Poly of them a couple of weekends ago change them. This team continues to fight and grow each week and it certainly has been a fun process to witness.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday, May 3 against Pepperdine at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

A Second-Team All-Big West selection last season, Murphy was named the tournament MVP.</p>\n<p>Enabling UCSB to reach the championship round was the fourth-year player’s game-winning goal in the second sudden victory period of the game following two overtime periods and one sudden victory session.</p>\n<p>“Sam really stepped it up this weekend. She was on the outside, inside, in transition, I mean she was everywhere,” Kay explained. “She’s co-captain with Lauren so she holds a big leadership role on the team. Additionally, she’s Big West scholar of the year, she’s got a 4.0 GPA. She’s the whole package.”</p>\n<p>Complementing the productive weekend performance of Murphy was UCSB’s attentive defense as it held each of its opponents to six or less goals, nearly two goals below its average allowance of 8.07 entering its contest versus the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ defense was most effective in the first half of Sunday’s matchup as they shutout Hawaii in the second period following their allowance of just one goal in the opening quarter of the game. Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a total of seven saves.</p>\n<p>Although Murphy would go on to tally her third hat trick in the second half of Sunday’s game, the scoring contributions of redshirt center Lauren Martin with a first half hat trick, senior attacker Bryn Hudson, and junior utility Taylor Shore helped UCSB earn a 5-1 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Rainbow Wahine managed to limit the Gauchos to one goal in the third period, Hawaii was unable to transform its defense into offense as freshman attacker Hannah Thompson was the lone goal scorer in the playing frame, which didn’t have much of a toll of the tam’s deficit as it still trailed 6-2.</p>\n<p>Despite scoring three goals in the game’s final period, Hawaii’s inconsistencies on defense hindered its comeback attempt as UCSB responded with five goals of its own to secure its championship victory.</p>\n<p>Included within UCSB’s championship run was an 8-4 win over No. 24 Cal State Northridge and its 7-6 sudden victory over No. 7 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>As a winner of three national championships in her four seasons as a starter at UCLA from 1996-2000, Coach Kay is hoping to integrate her extensive postseason experience along with her coaching abilities in preparing the Gauchos for their first NCAA appearance.</p>\n<p>“Something I learned as a player and throughout my coaching years going to the ‘Big Dance,’ it’s important to keep things in perspective,” Kay said. “We got here because of our hard work, team defense, and paying attention to the details and that’s what makes the difference. From my UCLA days, [according to a] John Wooden quote — ‘Little things makes big things happen,’ and that’s what we focused on this year and it worked.”</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will be held at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center from Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15. The tournament’s selection show concerning team seedings and matchups will take place tonight beginning at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/","id":4996,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4995,4994,4993],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain Atop Big West, Win Back-to-Back Conf.

The nation’s 76th best doubles team of seniors Nathan Eshmade and Miles Seemann took the first win of the day on court one downing the Anteaters 6-2.</p>\n<p>The veteran duo of junior co-captain Morgan Mays and Andrew Riminton rallied to win five straight games to seal the doubles round with a 6-4 win on court three despite starting the match trailing 4-1.</p>\n<p>“We played absolutely great in doubles,” Davis said. “It really gave us momentum for the rest of the match.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were in need of just three singles wins after defeating the Anteaters in the doubles round. Junior co-captain Teague Hamilton and sophomore Cody Rakela answered the call as they have all year playing on the lower courts with two-straight set sweeps.</p>\n<p>Hamilton was the first off the courts playing at the sixth spot and defeated the Anteaters’ Vatsal Bajpai 6-4, 6-2. Rakela put the Gauchos in a position to win the match topping UCI’s Justin Agbanyani 6-4, 6-4 on court five.</p>\n<p>Mays was able to seal the match on court three with a sweep of his own over Luca Marquad. The co-captain gave his team the 4-0 win defeating his opponent 6-3, 6-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos moved on to the final round to face the tournament’s second seeded Cal Poly Mustangs. This would be the second meeting between these two teams in just one week, as Santa Barbara defeated San Luis Obispo 5-2 in its final dual match of the season. The defending champions once again were crowned, downing the Mustangs 4-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB started off the match with a strong performance in doubles play, taking two quick matches on the lower courts.</p>\n<p>The veteran team of Riminton and the team’s co-captain in Mays was off the court first with a huge 6-1 win on court three. The Gauchos defeated the Mustang team of Dan Cardiff and Karl Enader to give their team the edge.</p>\n<p>The freshmen duo of Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm sealed the doubles point for Santa Barbara downing Garret Auproux and Tim Tan on court two with ease, 6-2.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos headed into singles play with a 1-0 lead and looked for just three wins to be crowned champions.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was the first to strike in the singles round with two straight wins to take a 3-0 lead over rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Junior co-captain Teague Hamilton grabbed the first win defeating Irvine’s Sreyas Kolachalam on court six 6-1, 7-5 and remained undefeated in dual matches this season.</p>\n<p>Moreno de Alboran added the second win as he defeated Garret Auproux for the second time this week on court two 7-5, 6-3.</p>\n<p>Finally, in a three set battle on court four the championship was sealed as Holm defeated Josh Ortlip 6-1, 2-6, 6-1 to give the Gauchos a 4-1 win and conference honors.</p>\n<p>“The matchups in the championship were the exact same from our dual match a week ago,” Davis said. “It’s great to see these guys play even better the second time around.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now have an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament as a result of their conference title, making the ‘Big Dance’ for the second-straight year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>The high energy was clear amongst the UCSB squad, who fed off one another’s focus in their final home series of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were bolstered over the weekend by strong performances from senior infielder Arianna Palomares, amassing 5 RBI and two doubles, junior infielder Emily Brucelas, slugging five hits in eleven at-bats to go along with 3 RBI, and junior designated hitter Jacqueline Hinojosa, totaling 5 hits, 2 runs and 1 RBI over eight weekend at-bats.</p>\n<p>On Sunday’s senior day double-header, the Gauchos and Rainbow Wahine split their two games, with the Gauchos winning the first 9-5.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine avoided the sweep by winning the second contest 4-1 on the back of a brilliant pitching performance from sophomore Brittany Hitchcock.</p>\n<p>In the day’s first leg, the scoring started in the bottom of the second with a leadoff shot over the left field fence for first-year infielder Sierra Altmeyer which gave the Gauchos a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>A wild pitch by UCSB senior Ashley Ludlow in the top of the third tied the game at one, and the Rainbow Wahine would go on to take the lead after a three-run inning in the top of the fourth making the score 4-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came roaring back, however, not wanting to be denied on an emotional day such as senior day.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa singled up the middle to load the bases before junior center fielder Stacy Cavazos ripped another single to center field to score Tetzlaff and Altmeyer to close the gap at 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB was not done, as after sophomore right fielder Jessica Johnston bunted the two baserunners over, first year shortstop Melanie Menor singled to bring home both Cavazos and Hiojosa, giving the Gauchos four runs in the inning and the lead which stood at 5-4.</p>\n<p>Despite a hard hit leadoff double from junior pitcher Kanani Aina Cabrales, part of a mass substation for the Rainbow Wahine in the previous inning, Ashley Wright was able to retire the side, helped by a great snag and throw at third base by Emily Brucelas for the inning’s final out.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the fifth frame proved to be fortuitous for the Gauchos, beginning with a walk for Jessica Tetzlaff. Jacqueline Hinojosa then bunted down the third base line, reaching first on an error by the first year infielder Nicole Lopez. Stacy Cavazos came though again with a shot to the left-center warning track, where first year center fielder Sarah Muzik ran into the wall trying to catch the ball.</p>\n<p>After Jessica Johnston reached on a fielders choice with Tetzlaff being thrown out at home, Melanie Menor beat out a ranging throw from the shortstop Ojala to score Hinojosa from third.</p>\n<p>In the next at-bat, a fly ball off the bat of Arianna Palomares was dropped by left fielder Ulu Matagiese, allowing both Jessica Johnston and Stacy Cavazos to score making the score 8-4.</p>\n<p>Senior catcher Samantha Stark walked to bring up junior Emily Brucelas, who drove one up the middle to score Melanie Menor and what would be her team’s final run.</p>\n<p>Hawai’i scored on a wild pitch the next inning, but no rally was in store as the Gauchos won the first Saturday contest 9-5, the win going to pitcher Ashley Wright.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did not fair as well in the second leg of the double header, losing 4-1 as sophomore pitcher Brittany Hitchcock went the full seven innings, allowing only six hits, one unearned run, and no walks to go along with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>A masterful performance, Hitchcock made up for a rough outing on Friday by hitting all her spots while in the circle.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, first-year pitcher Veronica Gulvin was passable, allowing three runs in four and a third innings before being replaced by Ashley Ludlow, who closed the game in more concise fashion than her shaky start in the previous game.</p>\n<p>Four runs were plenty for the Rainbow Wahine, however, as sophomore catcher Rachel Lack’s two run homer in the third inning proved to be enough for the victory on its own putting them up 2-0. Lack would also drive in first-year left fielder Jennifer Iseri on a fifth inning single making the score 3-0.</p>\n<p>A late rally in the sixth gave the Gauchos a glimmer of hope, as senior Arianna Palomares started the action with a blooper to right field, just past the outstretched arm of Tayana Mata at second base.</p>\n<p>With Stark on second and Brucelas on first, Altmeyer rocketed one to center field, scoring Stark which made the score 3-1 in favor of the visiting team.</p>\n<p>The Friday 9-3 Gaucho victory was decided in the bottom of the third frame,</p>\n<p>where with two outs and Jessica Tetzlaff on second, back to back doubles from Melanie Menor and Arianna Palomare gave UCSB a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>After Sierra Altmeyer loaded the bases with a grounder into to left field, Jacqueline Hinojose singled up the middle to score Stark, making the score 5-1 Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another three runs in the bottom of the sixth juxtaposed by Hawaii’s one run in the top of the inning gave UCSB a large cushion at 8-2 and let them coast to the solid win.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the final game of the series Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos were still in good spirits for their senior celebration.</p>\n<p>With parents, family members, and friends galore, the Gauchos honored both the Rainbow Wahine seniors, as well as five of their own: Ashley Ludlow, Jessica Tetzlaff, Alex Pingree, Arianna Palomares, and Samantha Stark.</p>\n<p>The weight of their accomplishments during four years at UCSB was staggering, especially when read aloud over the loudspeaker.</p>\n<p>“It was a fun ride,” said senior catcher Samantha Stark, looking back on her time at UCSB. She continued, “we ended it with a bang,” and in relation to the final two series on the road, she declared plainly, “we’ve got nothing to lose. We just want to keep fighting and take these series.”</p>\n<p>After the game, the head coach of the UCSB softball team had nothing but praises to share about the graduating seniors.</p>\n<p>“The seniors have stepped it up in the past couple of weeks.” Coach Galicinao said. “They’ve been great leaders, not only on the field, but just keeping everybody focused.”</p>\n<p>She continued, explaining, “it’s easier to stay engaged and compete when you’re one of the top two teams, but our team has been really consistent in their effort and in how they’ve been competing, and a lot of that has to do with senior leadership.”</p>\n<p>First-year Sierra Altmeyer noted that the younger players, including herself, “have become really close with the seniors,” and that they were, “just doing it for them.”</p>\n<p>The camaraderie was more obvious than ever for the UCSB softball team on Saturday, as a tight-knit group of players came together to win the final home series of the 2016 season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is a doubleheader against UC Davis Saturday, May 7 beginning at 1 p.m. with the second game starting at 3 p.m. at La Rue Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During that time the Gauchos were riding the momentum of a five year championship dynasty spearheaded by coach Chris Russell from 1991-1995.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This past weekend however, Santa Barbara took the first step needed to have another string of championships that this program has not had since the nineties.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Winning the first title in 20 for UCSB feels amazing, especially coming here and doing it from the first year, it is a wonderful feeling to be in the program,” Dubavets, the first year gaucho, said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB earned its seventh Big West title in school history after defeating the Aggies of UC Davis, CSU Northridge, and Hawaii.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The championship run began with a quick sweep of the seventh seeded UC Davis on Friday morning.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No.21 sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic made easy work of senior Tiffany Pham and junior Alex Huie by beating them 6-1 on court one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomores Lou Adler and fellow gaucho Amanda Atanasson swept their opponents 6-0 and clinched the doubles point for UCSB.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After establishing a one point lead the Gauchos went on to win the next three singles matches to close out the contest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Palina Dubavets beat sophomore Kristy Jorgensen in two sets 6-0 &amp; 6-1. Junior Jaimee Gilbertson and sophomore Natalie Da Silveira won their matches in consecutive sets as well.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The following day Santa Barbara faced off against CSUN and extended its win streak to seven by defeating the Matadors 4-1.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the Gauchos continued breezed through the first two rounds, Hawaii was upsetting last years’ Big West champion LBSU in a close 4-3 win.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Long Beach was heavily favored and expected to meet UCSB at the finals for a rematch of the last years conference finals matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We expected to play with Long Beach in the final, but we did not forget that Hawaii brought us a lot of problems a few months ago when we played against them, so it was also expectable.” Dubavets explained.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, thanks to freshman Marina Hruba and junior Cindy Nguyen on courts one and two, and the rest of the Rainbow Wahine they managed to earn themselves a ticket to the finals.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Saturday morning at the Indian Well Tennis Garden, Santa Barbara swept Hawaii 4-0 in a closely contested match, despite what the score may have indicated. Yet the Gauchos would not be denied a title after a long season of narrow defeats.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic wrapped up their undefeated weekend by putting six past senior Paulina Petriskova and sophomore Klara Pribylova.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On court two Hawaii won a set of its own 6-3 by beating junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All eyes were on court three as Atanasson and Adler engaged in a back and forth contest against senior Sarah Gealer and freshman Marina Hruba in order to clinch the doubles point and establish a crucial lead.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Earlier in the season during their first encounter, Adler and Atanasson fell to a different combination of Rainbow Warriors but after a series of close exchanges the young gauchos found redemption by winning the set 6-4, and the opening point.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB continued the onslaught and went on to win the next three singles matches. Excluding Da Silveira’s dominant singles performance against Petriskova all the matches were decided by two points.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The UCSB women’s tennis team has earned a bid to the NCAA championships following their conference victory and its first round opponent will be revealed Tuesday, May 3rd which will be streamed at <em>NCAA.com</em>. Its first round match-up will take place on May 13.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/","id":82,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[81,80,79],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Playoffs Submerged in Injuries","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/steph-355x230.jpe","mobile_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/steph.jpe","description":"Staff writer Elliot Thornton discusses the abundance of injuries that have appeared in the most recent years of the NBA Playoffs with regard to this season's postseason health woes.

While these tragic mishaps are unpredictable events that no sports fan desires, these injuries have clearly developed into stumbling blocks for teams during this postseason.</p>\n<p>Take Game 6 of the Los Angeles Clippers and Portland Trailblazers series, for example. Instead of seeing the Clippers’ floor general in Chris Paul finish his toe-to-toe bout with Portland star Damian Lillard, a right hand fracture forced the Clippers’ guard to sit on the sidelines and watch his younger teammate Austin Rivers take on a responsibility only Paul could confidently do: command the team at point.</p>\n<p>Friday night’s matchup did showcase the perseverance and potential of an athlete like Rivers, bouncing back from a bloody left eye injury and embracing the true spirit of competition with a playoff career-high 21 points.</p>\n<p>However, the Clippers arguably could have extended the series and headed back to L.A. for Game 7 if a healthy CP3 and Blake Griffin suited up for their team.</p>\n<p>The loss of two-time champ Chris Bosh has also been a hardship for the Miami Heat to overcome despite their recent series blowout victory Sunday afternoon. An alarming blood clot in the forward’s calf has not only kept Bosh out of commission since the All-Star break, but more notably created a disadvantage for his team.</p>\n<p>In what many considered could have been a sweep against a lower seeded Charlotte Hornets team, this first round matchup resulted in a full seven game series.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Bosh, guard Dwayne Wade has emerged as the sole leader once again and is carrying his team. “The Flash” resembled his 2006 NBA Finals play in order to escape elimination en route to the team’s advancement to the second round.</p>\n<p>While the 13-year vet managed to silence Hornets’ fans with his exceptional postseason play, he surely could utilize his 6’11” teammate as they move deeper into the playoffs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70597\" style=\"width: 564px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70597\" data-attachment-id=\"70597\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/ap-aptopix-heat-hornets-basketball-s-bkn-usa-nc/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=1000%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,666\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70597\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=554%2C369\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of ftw.usatoday.com\" width=\"554\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70597\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of ftw.usatoday.com</p></div>\n<p>Even the Golden State Warriors, the untouchable reigning champs that pulled off a historic 73-9 regular season record are currently experiencing their own dilemma, arguably the biggest red flag yet in this year’s NBA Playoffs.</p>\n<p>Sending James Harden and Dwight Howard on an empty-handed flight back to Houston, the Pacific Division champs did so at a cost.</p>\n<p>After losing the heart and soul of their team Stephen Curry to a nasty MCL sprain in Game 4 versus the Rockets, “Dub Nation” has depended on veteran Shaun Livingston and newcomer Ian Clark to take the place of the “Baby-Faced Assassin.”</p>\n<p>While the Warriors certainly justified their motto “Strength in Numbers” with a first round knockout and a Game 1 victory versus the Trailblazers, Curry’s questionable timetable certainly factors into how long Golden State will continue to tame Portland’s backcourt duo of Damian Lillard and C.J.

He set career-best season totals with 73 kills, 35 aces, and 1159 assists. Seif’s 4332 career helpers are the fourth highest in UCSB history, and his 118 service aces rank third in the school record books.</p>\n<p>His performances, throughout his career, were honored with various awards and all-team selections too. The four-year starter will be graduating having been recognized with three All-MPSF First Team awards and will likely be named an All-American for the third-straight year in the upcoming weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with Seif, McLaughlin will be losing three more seniors — Austin Kingi, Ryan Hardy, and Spencer Buckley. Kingi and Hardy, starting outside hitter and middle blocker, respectively, were third and fourth on the team with 227 kills (2.47 per set) and 166 (1.68 per set). Buckley, another outside hitter, only played in three matches, but averaged 1.4 kills per set on the year.</p>\n<p>The rest of the starting lineup, including kill-leader Matt Marsh, who averaged 3.29 kills per set as the focal point of the Gaucho offense, will return next season, which bodes well for the squad considering how some of the younger players developed towards the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Henri Cherry had a breakout year, averaging 2.01 kills per set on a team-best .486 hitting percentage. Another surprise was the performance of sophomore Hayden Boehle, who after a late-season position change from libero to outside hitter, tallying 12 kills in two of UCSB’s last four matches.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished the year with an impressive 13-2 at Rob Gym, but struggled with consistency on the road, where they were 7-8, none more painful than the season-ender in Provo.</p>\n<p>Still, Seif and McLaughlin said all year that they wanted to make a run they could be proud of, and it’s safe to say they did just that, playing some of the best volleyball in the nation for the last month of the year, and after forcing five sets against BYU, the Gauchos fell just short of a conference championship appearance.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70591\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70591\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-01/no-5-ucsb-mens-volleyball-season-in-review/","id":5366,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5365,5364,5363],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rivers Performance Exemplifies Why We Love Sports","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=640%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Austin Rivers performance last night reminded us sports fans that sports is more than just rings and top players; its about the heart these players display out on that court, field etc.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Too many times in sports, we get caught up in the things that don’t really matter.

Essentially, the Clippers season was over when the news broke that Chris Paul and Blake Griffin were out the rest of the series.</p>\n<p>No one had any hopes of them salvaging the series and no one believed Rivers could actually make a difference.</p>\n<p>Austin has had a difficult time earning respect in the NBA. As the former 10<sup>th</sup> overall pick, he displayed one of the worst rookie seasons by any lottery pick. The former Blue Devil was laughed at even more when his dad — Clippers Head Coach Doc Rivers — traded for him.</p>\n<p>He became a punchline for a lot of people. Not only was he a massive underachiever, but now the only coach that wants him is his dad. As you could imagine, Rivers has not had an easy career and it certainly did not get any better after going to L.A.</p>\n<p>But none of that mattered last night. Rivers was not trying to salvage his career. He was not trying to please his father. No … he was trying to do something much, much simpler: win a game for his team.</p>\n<p>What the former Duke point guard displayed was not for the “haters,” the nay-sayers, the critics or even his own father, rather, it was all for his teammates — especially Jamal Crawford — who did believe in him and knew he had it in him to make a difference.</p>\n<p>After receiving 11 stitches under his left eye, Rivers came back and certainly made his presence felt finishing the game with 21 points, eight assists, six rebounds and zero turnovers.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-vine\" style=\"display: block;\"><iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iPtnn5hr0lv/embed/simple\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately for him and his team, Crawford’s final chance to tie the game came up short, and the season was over.</p>\n<p>If his play did not earn him respect, his post-game interview sure did. An emotional point guard went up to the stage and what we saw was a truly authentic display of emotion from a player who truly left it all out on the court.</p>\n<p>With his eye battered, bruised and bleeding, Rivers led his team and literally bled for them to try to win a playoff game to keep their hopes alive.</p>\n<p>That is the stuff that earns you respect from all-around the league. From twitter to the people on the court, many people will never look at Austin the same and he earned that.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70532\" style=\"width: 315px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70532\" data-attachment-id=\"70532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-30/rivers-performance-exemplifies-why-we-love-sports/nba-playoffs-los-angeles-clippers-at-portland-trail-blazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NBA: Playoffs-Los Angeles Clippers at Portland Trail Blazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70532\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=305%2C191\" alt=\"Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports\" width=\"305\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance. Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>\n<p>And that is what sports is all about.

They will now look to avenge their rough start to conference play when it takes on a solid opponent Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara won the series after taking two of three from the Rainbow Warriors but is losing the series history which stands at 17-10. However, in recent years the Gauchos have taken 10 of the last 15 games.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB is in the midst of a 13-game home winning streak and if it can take the first two games from Hawaii it will set a new school record for most consecutive home wins, 15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is also off to its best record at home start in school history at 17-1 beating its previous mark of 16-2 which was set in 1984.</p>\n<p>In order to pull off the upset and beat an almost unbeatable Gaucho team at home, the Rainbow Warriors will need to rely on senior star Jacob Sheldon-Collins.</p>\n<p>Currently, the shortstop has the second best batting average in the Big West with a .401, is tied for the conference leads in hits (57), and leads the team in on-base percentage (.443) and runs scored (20).</p>\n<p>He is helped by freshman catcher Kekai Rios who has the sixth best batting average in the Big West at .339. This season, the young Hawaii native has also hit a game-winning home run this season. Sophomore first baseman Eric Ramirez leads the team in RBI with 26.</p>\n<p>These great hitters will be facing off against pitcher Shane Bieber. The junior currently has a 3.30 ERA with a 7-2 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber has pitched three straight complete games with the last one being his worst after going eight innings allowing seven runs and 13 hits. He will look to turnaround his performance and hopefully tie his career high, eighth win of the season.</p>\n<p>The pitcher will also look to be helped by the great hitting staff of the Gauchos. Coming off a solid game on Tuesday is second baseman J.J. Muno.</p>\n<p>The sophomore went 2-4 (.500) with two runs scored including the game-winner in the eleventh inning. He is tied for the team lead in home runs with four on the season and currently bats .269.</p>\n<p>Another solid hitter is designated hitter/first baseman Austin Bush. The redshirt sophomore is first in RBI (26), first in slugging percentage (.475) and third in batting average (.308).</p>\n<p>This weekend will be an interesting one for the Gauchos as they will need to go back to their winning ways and make a splash in conference play.</p>\n<p>They were projected to finish fourth in the Big West in the preseason poll, however, the talent this team has and the determination it has displayed proves they have the capability to finish much, much higher.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces-off against Hawaii Friday, April 29 at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday’s and Sunday’s game will be at the same location but at 2 p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this article said the Gauchos needed to sweep the weekend series to set the school record for most consecutive wins at home. The Gauchos only need to win the first two games to reach 15 straight wins, beating the previous school record of 14.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Despite the drawback, Santa Barbara finished its regular season schedule with a solid overall record of 15-12, 3-2 in conference play in spite of playing the vast majority of its games against the nation’s top-ranked teams.</p>\n<p>The Matadors, who have struggled all season, were incapable of winning a game in conference and finished 0-5 in the Big West with an overall record of 11-19.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow will be the second meeting between the two teams this year. In the first encounter, which took place roughly two weeks ago, the Gauchos dominated the second half of the match to give UCSB the 6-4 win on its Senior Day.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore had quite the match that day as she scored a pair of goals, drew three ejections and had three assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Not to be overlooked, however, was senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw, who put up her fourth consecutive double-figure saves performance with a total of 13 blocks against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Despite their early victory over the Matadors, the Gauchos cannot let their past victory over the Matadors give them a false sense of confidence. The Big West Tournament is a thing of its own, regardless of the predetermined seedings, as every team comes in with a brand new slate, and anything can happen.</p>\n<p>“That [tournament seeding] still does not mean anything; they are going to come out, and they are a great team,” redshirt senior Lauren Martin said. “So, this week, we have been dedicating some practice time to watching game film, scouting and watching the players that they have and refreshing on what they do on offense and what they do on defense and how we can beat that.”</p>\n<p>Efficiency on the offensive side of the pool will prove to be crucial to Santa Barbara’s chances at a victory. In their last game of the season against Long Beach State, the Gauchos were unable to convert their shots into goals and it cost them the win despite outshooting the Beach 23-13. The team will rely on its top scorers in junior utility Miranda Schrader, Hudson and Martin, who leads the team with a total of 45 goals.</p>\n<p>Martin has proven to be an essential component to the team’s offense. The Fresno native has consistently initiated scoring runs for the Gauchos that have allowed them to secure a lead early in games. Aside from marking the pace, Martin has come in clutch with game-winning goals time after time throughout the season.</p>\n<p>As for the Matadors, they, too, possess an impact player of their own. A freshman attacker from Murrieta, Madeleine Sanchez, leads the Big West with an impressive amount of 71 goals in her first season.</p>\n<p>She also leads the team with a high of 42 assists. Santa Barbara’s defense will have their work cut out for them trying to find a way to get this powerful attacker off her game right away.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the Big West Tournament at Campus Pool starting on Friday afternoon. UCSB will face CSUN this Friday, April 28 at 2 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>If Santa Barbara defeats CSUN, it will go on to face Long Beach State on Saturday, April 29 in a rematch that could send either team to the championship game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/","id":4989,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4988,4987,4986],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":78,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
