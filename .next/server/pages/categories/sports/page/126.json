If Cal Poly can steal a game or two and Santa Barbara can earn three wins, the Gauchos put their fate in their own hands for next weekend.</p>\n<p>“We know our goal is to sweep this weekend,” junior utility DeJanee Moore said. “We know this is a very big series, especially since Long Beach is still number one. It’s very important to sweep because our goal for this entire year was a Big West Championship and we know sweeping puts us in a good position to be Big West Champions this year.”</p>\n<p>Of course, UCSB will have to go through Riverside first. The Gauchos are currently 30-18 overall and 10-5 in the Big West while the Highlanders travel south with a 22-26 overall and 3-12 conference mark. UCR has dropped five of its last six games while Santa Barbara has won nine of its last 11.</p>\n<p>“We just need to stay within striking distance until that last weekend (when UCSB plays LBSU),” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “[It’s] one game at a time because Riverside has taken some games from teams and that’s what’s exciting about the Big West. Nothing is a gimme at all.”</p>\n<p>After a series victory against a Hawaii team that UCSB has struggled with in the past, the Gauchos have plenty of momentum moving forward. The series featured three high-scoring games, two of which went into extra innings. In 34 innings against the Rainbow Wahine, Santa Barbara put 23 runs on the board.</p>\n<p>“We really proved that we can perform in pressure situations,” junior third baseman Jenessa Jeppesen said. “That’s going to make everyone push a little harder, work a little harder for this weekend and allow us to be more confident.”</p>\n<p>Freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark helped UCSB to victory in Sunday’s rubber game, hitting 4-4 at the plate. In doing so, she set the single season hitting record with 76 on the year. Clark currently ranks first in the Big West in hits with the second-best player over 10 hits lower at 65.</p>\n<p>“[Clark is] a great player,” Moore said. “In the lead-off position, she’s there to start rallies. Her speed allows us to stay in the game even when people think we’re out of the game. She’ll get that base hit and all you need is a base hit to start a rally, so she’s been a really important aspect to the team this year.”</p>\n<p>Riverside ranks in the lower half of nearly every statistical category both offensively and defensively. However, in their last nine games, the Highlanders are 3-0 when scoring six or more runs. All losses have come in lower-scoring games.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCR’s biggest offensive threat is senior centerfielder Dionne Anderson. Anderson ranks fifth in the Big West in runs with 33, seventh in hits with 53, sixth in batting average at .379 and third in on-base percentage at .503.</p>\n<p>“Any team can come out and have a really great day and any great team can come out and have a bad day,” Jeppesen said. “It’s all about keeping our pitches where they need to be and having solid defense. We have to know how to pitch to them and play our defense. They’re all really strong runners, so we have to be on our toes on defense.”</p>\n<p>Trying to keep the score low and guarantee the Gauchos their fifth consecutive series victory is junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Currently 18-13 on the season, Wisdom has pitched the most innings in the Big West. Earning her 18th win last weekend, she passed her season win total from last season.</p>\n<p>Wisdom ranks seventh in the league in ERA at 3.38. Meanwhile, Riverside also has a solid pitcher in junior Alyssa Razo, who sits one spot above Wisdom with her 3.25 ERA.</p>\n<p>“Their pitching is not as fast as what we saw [last] weekend,” Jeppesen said. “We really have to be patient and work the count, but we have a lot of really disciplined hitters on the team. Hopefully, it’ll go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>First pitch in Saturday’s doubleheader is set for noon at Amy S. Harrison field. The series finale will take place Sunday at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 1st’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by</em> <em>Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/","id":1062,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1061,1060,1059],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos and Bruins Tie in 12 Innings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB and UCLA tied after 12 innings of play due to darkness coming over Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Yesterday was a missed opportunity for the No. 24 UCSB baseball team.

With runners on second and third base, UCLA managed to earn the game’s first run with a single, followed by a two-run RBI that chased Vasquez from the game. UCLA would put up one more run after the pitching change as Vasquez was charged with all four runs despite allowing only three hits in total.</p>\n<p>“His stuff wasn’t very good. I think he was a little flat,” Checketts said. “His command was just okay. He didn’t have great stuff today. The ball wasn’t coming out of his hand very good.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began clawing its way back into the game by scoring a run in the bottom half of the inning. After a walk and double that put two runners in scoring position, UCLA retired the next two batters but allowed a run on a fielding error that brought UCSB within three runs.</p>\n<p>Down 4-1 in the third inning, the Gauchos tied the score with one swing of the bat. With two runners on base, junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa smashed a three-run blast over the right field fence for his team-leading ninth homerun of the season. It was his first since April 4 after he went a stretch of 37 at-bats without hitting one.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to get something up in the zone, something elevated,” Kuresa said. “We had a runner on third with one out; I was just trying to hit a sac-fly and not a double play. I was pretty surprised he gave me a fastball there. He missed over the middle, and I put a good swing on it.”</p>\n<p>The tie did not last long as UCLA manufactured a run in the next inning against sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza, who came in relief for Vasquez. Mazza allowed a runner to reach first base, resulting in a successful steal of second after. The Bruins capitalized with another single to take the lead once more.</p>\n<p>Now trailing, Santa Barbara remained persistent on offense and managed to tie the game once more. With consecutive hits to put runners on first and second base, junior shortstop Peter Maris advanced to within 90 feet from the plate on a fly-out. In need of a clutch hit, freshman center fielder Andrew Calica delivered with an RBI up the middle to complete the 5-5 comeback.</p>\n<p>“We got some toughness,” Checketts said. “We’ve been down because the starting pitching hasn’t been very good this year. So we’ve been chasing runs quite a bit and have had a lot of situations like that. The guys definitely did a good job of coming back.”</p>\n<p>With 10 runs combined through the first five innings, the game from there on turned into a battle between the bullpens. After Mazza pitched an efficient 4.1 innings, allowing only one earned run, Checketts handed the ball over to junior Greg Mahle. Mahle retired the first three batters faced in the seventh inning and had a quick eighth inning to end his appearance.</p>\n<p>Despite not scoring for the rest of the game, the Gauchos did have opportunities to break the deadlock. UCSB put runners on the corners in the sixth inning for senior left fielder Joey Epperson, the team’s leading hitter. However, Epperson came up empty as he popped up to the shortstop to end the inning. In the following inning, the Gauchos failed to bring in Kuresa from third base after junior outfielder Scott Quinlan struck out looking with two outs.</p>\n<p>UCSB used just four pitchers for the entire game, including using sophomore closer Dillon Tate for the final four innings. Tate was on point in his appearance, striking out four batters on only 56 pitches. His combination of fastball and sinker kept UCLA from scoring.</p>\n<p>“I give all the credit in the world to Dillon,” Kuresa said. “He pitched a good game and they couldn’t do anything against him, too.”</p>\n<p>After 12 innings of play and with night starting to become a factor, the umpires called the game as a 5-5 draw.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for its biggest series of the season against first-place in the Big West UC Irvine beginning this Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/","id":4717,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4716,4715,4714],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The NBA Hits a Home Run and Bans Donald Sterling","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Donald Sterling received a lifetime ban from the NBA for his racist comments caught on audio.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Donald Sterling saga has developed into one of the most stunning and baffling stories in the world of sports in the last several years.</p>\n<p>Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was caught on audio recording telling his girlfriend, Vanessa Stiviano, that he did not want her posting photos of black people on Instagram or bringing black people to Clipper games.

Essentially, Sterling is stripped of all power but remains owner, is responsible for signing checks and fronting money and is still able to make money off the Clippers.</p>\n<p>The next move for the NBA is to remove the title of ownership from Sterling, a move that is possible only if three-quarters or more of NBA owners approve the vote. There is no doubt that owners will approve this, as any vote to keep Sterling as an owner of the NBA will be a black eye for the NBA and the owner of whichever franchise votes to keep him.</p>\n<p>Silver and the league office hit a grand slam with the decision to ban Sterling for life given the circumstances of Sterling’s comments and his previous racist actions. Social media exploded following Tuesday morning’s announcement as journalists, owners and players, current and former alike, all praised Silver’s decision to hand out the maximum punishment allowed to Sterling.</p>\n<p>Sterling deserves all backlash and punishment that comes his way following these remarks. However, his previous actions also call into question why he was allowed to continue as owner of the Clippers.</p>\n<p>Previously, Sterling was accused of discriminating against families with children, and Black and Latino tenants in apartment buildings he owns. A settlement was agreed upon and Sterling never admitted to guilt, but there have been several instances where his racial viewpoints have been called into question.</p>\n<p>It was not until the NBA’s hand was pushed by the audio recording that the league chose to take action against Sterling. It is a shame that he was allowed to stay for so long in a league so renowned for its progressiveness in social matters such as this.</p>\n<p>One reason that Silver’s decision is so justified is it takes pressure off Clippers fans, players and personnel to abandon ship during an important playoff run. Many were calling for those associated with the organization to boycott, calling into question their morals for non-action.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think it is unfair for people to blame players for wanting to continue to play and asking them to forfeit an entire season of hard work in response to an owner’s actions. The players play for each other and the fans, not for the sake of the owner’s happiness. Likewise, fans no longer have to battle whether to continue supporting the team and attend games or boycott and leave the players with empty stands during this critical playoff series.</p>\n<p>This is certainly an important day for the NBA and especially for the Clippers organization. There is no room for this type of behavior or these thoughts in sports and the NBA made the right decision to get rid of Donald Sterling. Good riddance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears on page 10 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/","id":535,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[534,533,532],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dillon Tate Q and A: Food, Music and Baseball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball17PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball17PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=853%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Mark Salay sat down with Gaucho pitcher Dillon Tate for a fun Q and A session.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a fastball clocking in at over 95 mph and a nasty slider that makes some batters look like little leaguers, sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate has established himself this season as one of the best closers in the nation.

But I’d say the calendars we have set up on the computer help me a lot to get organized and just being really cautious of my time and trying to manage. That is what helps me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So what are some of the things you like to do to relax?</p>\n<p>A: I enjoy going to the beach in my spare time. I don’t really get much spare time, but on my off days I like to go down to the beach after class with all my teammates, and we’ll play catch on the beach, which is pretty nice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: When you want that cheap meal, what’s your favorite place in I.V. to hit up?</p>\n<p>A: There’s a number of different places in I.V. that I can go to for some cheap meals. The Habit is a pretty good place to go for a cheap meal or Kaptain’s Barbeque is a place I enjoy going to. And if I’m not in I.V. or one of those places, I will probably go to In-N-Out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Before every game what music do you play to get you pumped up?</p>\n<p>A: That’s a good question. I always try to listen to some of the same songs on my phone when I’m in the clubhouse before the game. Just rap, I would say. I listen to Rick Ross before a game. That’s something I’ve done continuously before every game — just that same [Rick Ross] song right before I go out on the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Which song is it?</p>\n<p>A: It’s called “9 Piece.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: You’ve been playing baseball for such a long time. Do you ever get tired of the sport?</p>\n<p>A: I would say no. The only thing I would get tired with sometimes is practice because it’s kind of the same old routine in that it gets tedious, but I’m not really tired of it. The only reason I would probably get tired of the sport I feel like is when I’m out in the field and I don’t have anything to eat, and I get hungry. Because then I get kind of cranky.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Do you ever take some of that crankiness out on your teammates? Can they tell?</p>\n<p>A: Maybe some of them can, like some of the other pitchers because we have the same rotation together sometimes. So when we share these rotations together I feel like some of them might see that like, “Oh, Dillon is getting pretty cranky” or “Dillon must be hungry.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Which baseball team do you root for?</p>\n<p>A: I really like the Red Sox, not because they won the World Series this past year, but I’ve been a fan of them since 2003 when they lost in the ALCS to the Yankees. That’s kind of odd how a loss in the playoffs was something that attracted to me to another team. But it wasn’t so much a loss, but just the way they played, that I was attracted to.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So I’m guessing you really hate Aaron Boone then?</p>\n<p>A: Not a fan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What about Derek Jeter? Are you sad he’s retiring?</p>\n<p>A: Not really sad, but even though he’s on the Yankees and everything, that’s someone that I feel everyone in baseball looks up to … I feel like people in Boston don’t loathe him or anything, but they respect him for what he’s done and how he’s been in the game so long.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Any animosity toward Jacoby Ellsbury?</p>\n<p>A: Ahhh! That’s just a tough situation. He was a really big part of [the Red Sox] and it really sucks to lose someone like that, but I mean you got to think the individual player has to do what’s best for them. I think that’s what he did; he just did something that was best for him and so he went to the Yankees. It sucks to see him go, but you got to respect it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What about you personally? Any game that you had a big role in that stands out to you?</p>\n<p>A: There haven’t been any games that stand out to me personally, but I’d say close games we win are highlights for me. Any game we win where I’m pitching or not pitching is always good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s been your most embarrassing moment on the field while playing for UCSB?</p>\n<p>A: I don’t really have one. I really haven’t [had] one that embarrassing yet, so I will keep my fingers crossed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Did anything embarrassing in high school happen to you?</p>\n<p>A: Oh high school, definitely. I was at third base once, and this guy hit a swinging bunt. We were playing our rival school and I went up to get the swinging bunt, and I missed it under my glove. And I tried to turn around really fast to go get it, and my foot just came out from under me, and I just fell on my back. That was pretty bad — people were laughing at me and everything.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s one thing you can’t live without?</p>\n<p>A: Probably my music is one thing I couldn’t live without. That’s something I need every day; I wake up, and I play my music and I ride my bike to class.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Baseball players are pretty famous for having these insane pregame rituals. Do you have one?</p>\n<p>A: I wouldn’t even call it a ritual; I would call it more of a routine. As far as my routine goes, I come to the field with my headphones on and after we’re done taking batting practice — well, I got to back up a little bit — I stretch the same person out every day, even in practice. After we’re done with batting practice I go into the clubhouse, I eat my sandwich and I always listen to music, and I listen to that same song right before I take the field. So that would be something that’s part of my routine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So you bump that same Rick Ross song every single time?</p>\n<p>A: Yeah. I might listen to a couple different songs before, while I’m relaxing watching TV, but it’s primarily music that gets me game ready and focused. And I always end the playlist with that Rick Ross song.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I have to check that song out. His last album was pretty good.</p>\n<p>A: Yeah, I enjoyed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Yeah, “Sanctified” is my favorite song on the album.</p>\n<p>A: I’d say the second song is my favorite on the album.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Is that “The Devil is a Lie” with Jay-Z ?</p>\n<p>A: No, it’s “Rich is Gangsta.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s one team you hate losing to the most?</p>\n<p>A: I wouldn’t say there’s one team in particular I hate losing to, but it’d probably be just any team we lose to. I don’t like it. Especially home losses. Home losses are one thing I really can’t stand because I just don’t like it when another team takes the mound after you lose, and they walk on your mound … I feel we should beat everyone we play because I think the guys on the team are that good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Now finish this sentence for me. UCSB will make it to Omaha if…</p>\n<p>A: … the Gauchos continue to play well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Simple as that?</p>\n<p>A: It’s as simple as that. If we continue to play well, we will make it to Omaha.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55082\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55082\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/","id":4716,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4715,4714,4713],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to BYU in MPSF Semifinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensVolleyballCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensVolleyballCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's season ended this weekend as the Gauchos were swept by BYU in the MPSF semifinals.

Multiple BYU attack errors and two kills from senior outside hitter Matt Hanley kept the match even at 7-7. BYU turned it around with three blocks and a service ace from senior outside hitter Taylor Sander to take a dominant 15-9 lead. UCSB found its rhythm and was able to pull within four, but Sander’s dominant offensive performance carried the Cougars to an easy victory in the first set.</p>\n<p>“They were just serving a lot better than we were. They are used to the environment down there,” Seif said.</p>\n<p>In the second set, the Gauchos stepped up earning a .222 hitting clip, their highest of the night. As a team, UCSB hit just .086 in comparison to BYU’s .273. Senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson opened up the set with two kills for the Gauchos, giving them an early 4-2 lead. Three consecutive attack errors from UCSB and a service ace from junior outside hitter Josue Rivera made it easy for BYU to regain the lead. The Cougars held the lead until late in the set when the Gauchos tied it at 18-18. Both teams exchanged points back and forth until a kill from Sander and a UCSB service error ended the set in favor of the Cougars.</p>\n<p>The third set proved that the momentum was not going to shift in time for the Gauchos to pull off another miraculous comeback. Despite a consistent offensive push from Hanley, the Gauchos could not get their momentum going. Two of UCSB’s key hitters, redshirt junior Weston Nielsen and senior opposite Evan Licht, could not withstand the BYU block. The Cougars outblocked the Gauchos 17.5-3.0 on the night. BYU’s sophomore middle blocker Michael Hatch had a career-high 13 blocks against UCSB.</p>\n<p>“They had us out of system so it made their job a lot easier to key in our attackers,” Thompson said. “They had us out of system for the entire game so we were really only able to go to two people.”</p>\n<p>After this loss, the Gauchos were eliminated from the conference tournament and were not selected to play in the NCAA tournament. BYU went on to face Stanford on Saturday night, sweeping the Cardinal in a 3-0 match and claiming the title as the MPSF champions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/","id":5242,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5241,5240,5239],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Capture Series Victory Over UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite winning two of three games to win a weekend series against UC Riverside, the Gauchos felt they needed a sweep over the Highlanders and were disappointed with the lone loss.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 25 UCSB baseball team was one game away from completing a sweep of UC Riverside at home, but yesterday’s disappointing 7-3 loss left the Gauchos with a bittersweet feeling.</p>\n<p>“We really wanted and needed a sweep in terms of looking at the postseason,” junior second baseman Woody Woodward said. “Series wins are important, but in the position we’re in, we really wanted a sweep there.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing yesterday, the Gauchos improved to 26-11 overall and 7-8 in the Big West conference by winning the first two games of the series.

UCSB was down 4-0 as early as the first inning as freshman pitcher Shane Bieber struggled settling in. The Gaucho offense was kept in check by the Highlanders’ senior relief pitcher Dylan Stuart. Stuart entered the game in the fourth inning and had command of his four pitches to keep hitters guessing throughout his 5.2 innings of work.</p>\n<p>“They came out and scored four in the first; that’s usually tough to rebound from,” Woodward said. “Those are big momentum swings. We added on and responded and scored in the same inning — in the first — but it’s tough when you have a deficit like that early on. I think some things didn’t go our way (yesterday).”</p>\n<p>UCSB mounted a come-from-behind 6-5 win on Saturday after erasing a two-run deficit. Down 5-3 in the sixth inning, the Gauchos got the ball rolling on a double that brought junior outfielder Cameron Newell home from first base.</p>\n<p>After the Highlanders went down quietly in the top of the seventh inning, Santa Barbara began the bottom half with consecutive singles to put runners on first and second base. UCSB was quick to capitalize on the situation when UCR committed a throwing error on a sacrifice bunt that brought in the runner from second. With one out and the scored tied, Newell gave UCSB the lead with an RBI groundout before the inning ended.</p>\n<p>Now with a one-run lead, Head Coach Andrew Checketts elected to bring in his shutdown closer, sophomore Dillon Tate, for the two-inning save. The right-hander had his usual stuff working and converted his tenth save of the season, with five of the six outs recorded coming by way of strikeout.</p>\n<p>“We rely on Dillon to do that when he comes in the game,” junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa said. “We think he’s going to get it done. It wasn’t a surprise to any of us how he performed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was in full control in the series’ opening game on Friday, coming out with a 6-2 win behind the stellar pitching of sophomore Justin Jacome. Jacome tossed 6.1 innings of three-hit ball and gave up only two runs on the day to improve his record to 5-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>“He did a good job throwing strikes and pounding the strike zone,” Checketts said. “He struggled a little bit with his command early and was able to find it; he did a good job.”</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris led the way offensively for Santa Barbara with a three-hit performance. Maris tripled in the first inning to bring in a runner from first base and then came home on a sacrifice fly to give UCSB a 2-0 lead. Maris once again came to bat with a runner on second in the sixth inning and singled to left field to tack on another run for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCR got back to into the game with a two-run seventh inning, however, Santa Barbara countered with a three-run effort in the bottom half to push its lead to 6-2 and put away the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next play UCLA at home on Tuesday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/","id":4715,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4714,4713,4712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Tennis Falls in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensTennisKennethSong.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensTennisKennethSong.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A 4-0 first round victory by the UCSB women’s tennis team over UC Davis in the Big West Tournament lifted the spirits of the Gauchos on Friday.

However, this did not occur before the Gauchos put up a steady fight, losing narrowly in many of the matches.</p>\n<p>Long Beach promptly took all three doubles matches from the Gauchos with several notable victories. Freshman Maeva Razakasoa and freshman Hayley Thompson defeated UCSB’s freshman Jaimee Gilbertson and Garcia 8-6, and junior Karolina Rozenburg and freshman Holly Reid beat freshman Kaiulani Boyer and Meehan 8-6.</p>\n<p>The 49ers then received their final two victories from the third singles spot with a win from freshman Julie Gerard over sophomore Boyer 6-3, 7-5, and the second singles match with a victory from sophomore Ebba Unden over junior April Scatliffe 6-1, 6-3.</p>\n<p>With the season at a close for the Gauchos, the planning for next season begins. Yet, UCSB should look at this past year as a definite victory for many reasons. Even with the injuries of numerous players and the rebuilding of a newer team, Santa Barbara was still able to enter the Big West Tournament strong and gain a first round victory, a season-long goal of theirs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/womens-tennis-falls-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/womens-tennis-falls-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/womens-tennis-falls-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/womens-tennis-falls-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/womens-tennis-falls-in-big-west-tournament/","id":175,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[174,173,172],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Rubber Match Against Hawaii to Take Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB remains in second place in the Big West standings with two victories over Hawaii this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After splitting two high-scoring games that both went into extra innings Saturday, the UCSB softball team needed a victory in Sunday’s rubber game against Hawaii to stay in contention for a Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>Rallying behind their freshmen, the Gauchos came away with the 6-4 win, clinching the series at home.</p>\n<p>The first-years combined for five of the six RBI for Santa Barbara and half of the team’s runs total.

Entering the day just three hits from tying the regular season hit record, Clark’s four hits brought her total to 76, breaking the record previously owned by former player and current assistant coach Christine Ramos.</p>\n<p>“She’s not even close to her ceiling,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said of Clark. “We don’t’ have to worry about records with her. She knows her goal is to get on base any way that she can.”</p>\n<p>Each game during the entire series was close, with all three games being decided by two runs or less.</p>\n<p>With the score tied 3-3 heading into the bottom of the sixth inning on Sunday, hits became contagious for the Gauchos as they strung together five straight to take a three-run advantage into the seventh. Although Hawaii made a comeback, scoring one run in the seventh, a double play from Santa Barbara ended the game.</p>\n<p>“We got on a roll and the ball looked super big,” Clark said. “They just couldn’t catch us. Everyone was finding a hole.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, UCSB improves to 30-18 overall and 10-5 in the Big West, just three games behind first-place Long Beach State. Hawaii dropped to 20-24 overall and 5-10 in conference.</p>\n<p>“[The series win] keeps us in the hunt. We’re taking care of what we need to without having to rely on other people,” Galicinao said. “We just need to stay within striking distance until that last weekend [when UCSB plays LBSU].”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s doubleheader featured two nail-biters as the two teams combined 34 runs in 17 innings of play.</p>\n<p>Game two swung the Rainbow Wahine’s way. Earning the 9-8 victory in nine innings of play, Hawaii jumped out to a 6-2 lead in the fourth. After adding two more runs in the seventh, the Gauchos needed an incredible seventh inning. Santa Barbara delivered, playing small ball and moving runners with six singles to score six runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>However, the effort would fall short as junior first baseman Leisha Li’ili’i hit a home run to even the series at 1-1. It was her second homer of the game. Li’ili’i ranks second in the Big West in homers with her total now at 14 on the year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, the team that leads the league in home runs during conference play, improved to 12-4 when they hit two or more home runs.</p>\n<p>“The heart lineup that had been hitting home runs came up in the seventh,” Galicinao said. “I’ve been a little hard on [junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom] this weekend because she’s had better days than she’s shown this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing both games on Saturday at Hawaii’s tempo, Santa Barbara was able to edge out the Rainbow Wahine in a high-scoring battle in game one, winning 9-8 in eight innings.</p>\n<p>The offensive battle featured a close, see-saw game the entire way, but UCSB once again had to come back from behind in the seventh. Down two runs with one runner on base and two outs, Brucelas hit a home run to left center field, her fifth of the season.</p>\n<p>Going into the eighth, Hawaii’s freshman centerfielder Lindsey Willmon scored on a home run, but the Gauchos answered right back. Wisdom singled before sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore homered to left field to take the series opener. It was Moore’s first home run of the year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/","id":1061,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1060,1059,1058],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End Season With Overtime Victory Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloKennethSong.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloKennethSong.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated UC Davis in overtime for fifth place in the  Big West Championships.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The season has officially come to an end for the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team.

We each made mistakes but we were also able to make some great things happen.”</p>\n<p>After a back and forth battle in which neither team was able to pull away, the two sides found themselves deadlocked heading into overtime.</p>\n<p>“We played hard and smart the entire game,” Porter said. “After the buzzer sounded at the end of the fourth, we came into the wall and all agreed we weren’t going to end the season with a loss.”</p>\n<p>The game remained extremely tight until the very end, but UCSB eventually got the win that it wanted, holding on for an 11-10 victory.</p>\n<p>“We were able to pull away with a win because we came together as a team,” Porter said. “We refused to give up, and fortunately for us our offense and defense worked really well together in overtime.”</p>\n<p>Two days earlier, the Gauchos came into their first game of the weekend against Long Beach looking to avenge a 9-5 loss earlier this month.</p>\n<p>“Going into the game we were very excited to play them again,” Porter said. “[They] came into the game knowing we were going to give them a fight.”</p>\n<p>Things looked good early on with sophomore utility Samantha Murphy taking advantage of a 6-on-5 to give UCSB a 1-0 lead. However, quick goals from senior defender Coriann Snyder and senior attacker Chelsea Parks gave the 49ers a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Sophomore attacker Miranda Schrader gave the Gauchos their second goal of the day on another 6-on-5 situation to tie it at two goals apiece, but Long Beach quickly took the lead again and did not relinquish it for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>A second straight four-goal quarter sent the 49ers to halftime with an 8-4 advantage with Parks and junior attacker Justine Morgan leading the way. Parks eventually finished the day with four goals and Morgan contributed a hat trick of her own.</p>\n<p>As UCSB headed into the second half needing something to change, it looked to its defense to spark some momentum. However, the part of the Gauchos’ game that had been its biggest strength down the final stretch of the season became a problem when they needed it most.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest weakness was our defense,” Porter said. “We tried to switch it up in the second half to something we barely practice. When that didn’t seem to work I think the team began to get really frustrated which affected our offense.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach opened the second half with three goals to push the lead to 11-4, putting the game out of reach. The 49ers eventually cruised to a 12-7 win.</p>\n<p>Senior utility Jade Wentz Fitzgerald led the Gauchos with two goals and sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw led the defense with three saves.</p>\n<p>With the season now officially over, UCSB has ten days off before it starts preparations for next season.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to work even harder than we did during this season to get better as a team,” Porter said. “We do have a lot of work to do and it’s going to take a lot of hard work and dedication, but I know we’re very capable of coming back even stronger next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55059\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-end-season-with-overtime-victory-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55059\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-end-season-with-overtime-victory-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-end-season-with-overtime-victory-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-end-season-with-overtime-victory-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-end-season-with-overtime-victory-against-uc-davis/","id":5051,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5050,5049,5048],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Decision to Cal Poly to End Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos dropped in the second round of the Big West Tournament to rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team’s season ended in defeat on Friday afternoon at the hands of rival school Cal Poly in the semifinals of the Big West Championships.

Still without Galskov, the Gauchos dropped the doubles point by losing two doubles matches and winning one. Johnsson and Seemann defeated their opponents, junior Devin Barber and freshman Corey Pang, 8-5, but the Gauchos could not take the point as they lost at No. 1 and No. 3 doubles.</p>\n<p>“Losing the doubles point left us really screwed for the rest of the match,” Hamilton said. “I’m confident we would have taken the match if we had won the doubles point to start.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fared no better in singles, and they were not able to rebound from their loss to Cal Poly the previous weekend. Sultan lost in his rematch with freshman Ben Donovan 6-1, 6-2, whereas he had won last week. Johnsson lost to senior Jurgen De Jager 6-1, 6-3, and Steeb fell to junior Naveen Beasley 6-1, 6-4. This loss knocked the Gauchos out of the conference tournament and thus ended their season.</p>\n<p>Looking back, the Gauchos caught some bad breaks which haunted them throughout the season. UCSB lost eight 4-3 decisions over the course of the season and could have improved its chances of making it to the NCAA tournament if a few of those matches had gone its way. Then, for the biggest tournament of the season, the team’s star and most victorious player, Galskov, fell ill and was not able to play.</p>\n<p>“We’re a young team. We had a lot of unfortunate matches over the season as a whole and the bad losses at the start of the season definitely had an impact on us for the rest of the spring,” Hamilton said. “It was tough not having Toby this weekend but we couldn’t do anything about it and in the end we didn’t win the matches we had to.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now look forward to next season where they will return the entire current squad, except graduating senior Gryaznov. With the experience the younger players got this season, the team is very optimistic for next year.</p>\n<p>“I’m really confident in our team doing well next year,” Hamilton said. “We’ve got the same team coming back save one guy and we expect to build off what we did this year for next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

All the teams are really close and any team can win any game in my opinion. We’re going to have to play our best and hopefully we do.”</p>\n<p>After a 1-5 start to the season, the Gauchos have battled hard all year to their current record of 11-14 overall and 2-3 in the Big West, despite playing a majority of their games against some of the nation’s top teams. They enter the Big West Championships as the No. 5 seed.</p>\n<p>Long Beach, which enters as the No. 4 seed in the tournament, boasts a record of 18-10 overall and 2-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Last time we played them we didn’t do so well, but we’re going to go forward from that and learn from our mistakes,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “We plan to watch game film and really focus on their defense and plays that they run, so we don’t have a repeat of what happened [last time].”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rely on a defense grounded in team communication which has improved tremendously since the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>Anchoring that defense will be two goalkeepers in sophomore Mackenzie Brokaw and freshman Nikki Quinn, both of whom have shared playing time over the last three games.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played great defense in the second half of the season,” Wigo said. “[Long Beach is] a team we definitely can beat.”</p>\n<p>While the defense should prove to be a reliable weapon once more, UCSB knows it still has to score goals in order to win.</p>\n<p>“We need to make sure we’re on point with our shots because when we played them the other weekend we weren’t on key with our shooting,” Martin said. “We have to come out fired up and ready to play from the beginning. We’ll work on our 6-on-5 in practice and if we do that and execute what we’ve been working on, then I think we’ll be good to go.”</p>\n<p>The last time the 49ers played UCSB, they took control of the game by looking to their two top goal-scoring seniors, attacker Chelsea Parks and defender Coriann Snyder, each of whom put in two and three goals in the 9-5 win, respectively.</p>\n<p>Parks finished the regular season with the fourth highest goal-scoring tally in the Big West at 1.70 per game and 47 total. Snyder, despite being considered a defender, still managed to finish eighth in goals at 1.59 per game and 48 total.</p>\n<p>If UCSB can pull off the win against Long Beach State, it will likely take on No. 6 UC Irvine on Saturday with a chance to play in the Big West first-place game. A loss to the 49ers will result in a Sunday game for fifth place.</p>\n<p>The game is to begin at 1:30 p.m. this Friday in Long Beach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 24th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/","id":5065,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5064,5063,5062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Defend Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-8051.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-8051.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces UC Riverside in the Big West Tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s crunch time for the UCSB men’s tennis team this weekend.</p>\n<p>Everything the men have been working toward this season comes down to how the team plays in the next few days.

This year, the Gauchos come in as the third seed with targets on their backs as every team wants to be the one to knock out the defending champs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the tournament with an 8-13 overall record but a 3-1 conference record. Last time the Gauchos faced off against UCR, the Gauchos stomped on the Highlanders, winning every match for a 7-0 dual match victory. The Highlanders enter the tournament as the weakest team at the No. 6 seed. UCR posted a 2-21 record and was 0-5 in conference play.</p>\n<p>“We expect Riverside to come out playing hard,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “Last time we played them they pushed us hard in doubles, and they will be one or two guys better than they were last time out.”</p>\n<p>Freshman Cooper Bridge leads the Highlanders with nine dual match victories in singles and will be paired with fellow freshman Michael Carella at No. 1 singles. Junior Luis Gastao is expected to play No. 1 singles.</p>\n<p>A main concern for the Gauchos heading into the Big West Tournament is whether No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles player junior Tobias Galskov will be fit to play. Galskov was ill and not able to compete in the Gauchos’ 4-3 loss to Cal Poly on Saturday, but looks to be better for the match on Thursday. He has not been practicing this week, but plans to travel with the team and it appears that it will be close to a game-time decision on whether he competes or not.</p>\n<p>Following Galskov, the Gauchos look for their older players to step up as they know how to win this tournament. Junior Ziad Sultan will be expected to hold his own against tough opponents playing at No. 2, or possibly No. 1 in Galskov’s absence. Sultan will hope to build off his 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory playing at No. 1 over freshman Ben Donovan of Cal Poly. Along with Sultan, UCSB will need lone senior on the team Sasha Gryaznov to pick up the slack as a team leader and try to improve on his five match victories this season.</p>\n<p>Also expected to play a big role this weekend will be star freshmen Teague Hamilton and Erik Johnsson. Hamilton has won 14 matches this season, tying him with Galskov for the most on the team, while Johnsson has won 11 matches playing at No. 4 singles.</p>\n<p>“The goal is definitely to win [The Big West], but it’s gonna be tough,” Galskov said. “I believe we have the team to win, and we can only start thinking about the NCAA tournament if we play our best this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The tournament will be held at Indian Wells, where there is an expected high temperature of 90 degrees on Thursday. The Gauchos hope their fitness training will be a huge factor in helping them to defeat their opponents this weekend.</p>\n<p>Also competing in the tournament will be No. 1 seed Hawaii, No. 4 seed UC Davis, and No. 5 seed UC Irvine. The Gauchos’ only loss in conference play came at the hands of No. 2 seed Cal Poly and the Mustangs did not play Hawaii as the match was rained out in February.</p>\n<p>The quest for back-to-back championships begins on Thursday at 9 a.m. against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54984\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54984\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/","id":174,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[173,172,171],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hot Gaucho Squad Seeks Revenge Against Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/softball2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/softball2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB tries to make up ground on first-place Long Beach State.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the past, the UCSB softball team has been dominated by Hawaii, losing the all-time series 17-43.

The Rainbow Wahine, who won the Big West last year, have lost seven consecutive games.</p>\n<p>“We definitely think we’re going to come back and get the win and redeem ourselves from last year,” junior infielder Jenessa Jeppesen said. “It would be a huge win for us because they’ve always been a top competitor for us. With the lineup we have this year, I think we can finally take a series with them.”</p>\n<p>While not a particularly strong offensive team, Hawaii knows how to hit the long ball and wants to see high-scoring games. Hawaii ranks second in the Big West in home runs with 47 on the season, including a league-leading 12 during conference play.</p>\n<p>This season, Hawaii lives and dies by the home run, going 2-13 when hit it hits zero home runs and 11-3 when the team hits two or more home runs. If the Rainbow Wahine can put six or more runs on the board, they are nearly unbeatable at 16-1 this year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s biggest target offensively is Leisha Li’ili’i. The junior first baseman ranks second in the conference in homers with 12 on the season. As a result, she is also tied for second in walks. Li’ili’i’s .514 on base percentage and slugging percentage during league play of .875 also place second in conference.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii’s always had really strong hitters, so we have to know what pitches to pitch to them,” Jeppesen said.</p>\n<p>Defensively, Hawaii doesn’t serve as a threat, owning the worst ERA in the league. In fact, the team’s best pitcher holds an ERA of 4.07. The Rainbow Wahine also give up the most runs.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, for UCSB, junior pitcher Shleby Wisdom will try to control Hawaii’s offense and keep the score low. During the Gauchos’ winning streak the past eight games, Wisdom has pitched every inning. Last weekend at UC Davis, she improved to 16-12 on the year.</p>\n<p>Wisdom’s ERA of 3.14 ranks fifth in league. In addition, Santa Barbara holds the second spot in the conference in strikeout-to-walk ratio at 1.6.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to keep the ball low and keep spinning it,” Wisdom said. “I just have to trust my defense and keep it on the field and we’ll be good.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for noon on Saturday at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 24th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/","id":1060,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1059,1058,1057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Chasing a Crown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2.12.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.v.CSUN-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2.12.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.v.CSUN-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 5 UCSB Tries to Upset No. 4 BYU for Second Time in Two Weeks","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 5 UCSB men’s volleyball team travels back to Provo, Utah for a much-anticipated rematch against No. 4 BYU tonight in the MPSF semifinals.</p>\n<p>The game should be an exciting matchup after Santa Barbara and BYU split the season series 1-1.

The combination of serving and passing has been the deciding factor of all matches for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As long as we play our game, we should be okay,” Hanley said. “We are one of, if not the best, serving team in the nation and we need to crush our serves every time.”</p>\n<p>Another key to success against BYU will be to quiet its famous crowd. In order to do this, the Gauchos will need to maintain a strong presence at the net and halt the Cougars’ offensive momentum.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blocker Jake Staahl will serve an important role here, finishing fourth in the league with a blocking average of 1.24 per game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the net, the Gauchos will need to keep a close watch on senior outside hitter Gonzalo Quiroga. Quiroga was an offensive leader for BYU all season long, but in specific led the Cougars with 18 kills two weeks back against the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will be available with live video and stat coverage. Tune into BYU TV at 7 p.m. (PDT).</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos win, they will advance on to the finals to face the winner of the Pepperdine vs. Stanford matchup on Saturday night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/chasing-a-crown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/chasing-a-crown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/chasing-a-crown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/chasing-a-crown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/chasing-a-crown/","id":5241,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5240,5239,5238],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 19 Gauchos Enter Must-Win Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces UC Riverside in second to last home series.

With only three Big West series remaining, the Gauchos will need to win this weekend at home against UC Riverside to strengthen their playoff chances.</p>\n<p>“We have to win the rest of our series,” junior second baseman Woody Woodward said. “We just need to score more runs than the other team. It sounds simple, but we have to hit when we don’t pitch and pitch when we don’t hit.”</p>\n<p>UCSB limps home with some serious battle scars after last weekend’s tough series against Long Beach State. The Gauchos ended up on the wrong side of one-run games twice against LBSU before winning the series finale. Standing 24-10 overall and 5-7 in the Big West conference, Santa Barbara is in fifth place in the standings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I don’t think there’s any pressure because we know we’re a good team,” Woodward said. “And we know that we can go places. We have to take it one game at a time and get better every day.”</p>\n<p>UCR has been the conference’s biggest overachievers so far. Climbing their way to almost .500, the Highlanders are 17-19 overall and 6-3 in league after sweeping UC Davis in their last conference series. Riverside sits alone in third place, two games out of the second spot.</p>\n<p>With just two conference road wins under its belt, Santa Barbara welcomes a return to Caesar Uyesaka Stadium where it is 15-4 this year. Meanwhile, the road has been a headache for UCR. Riverside is 4-12 outside of home and has lost eight of its last nine away games. UCSB will have to take advantage of the home field given this is the second to last conference home series on the year.</p>\n<p>Senior Jake Smigelski will take the mound in game one for the Highlanders. In his last start against UC Davis, Smigelski threw 100 pitches in five laboring innings of work to improve to 5-4 on the season. For UCSB, sophomore Justin Jacome will be called on to contain the UCR offense that ranks third in hitting.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Pettibone is slated to take the mound for the Gauchos in game two, followed by freshman Shane Bieber in game three. Bieber is coming off his best start of the season last weekend when he tossed eight innings and gave up just one run en route to striking out eight batters.</p>\n<p>After leading the nation in hitting last week, senior third baseman Joey Epperson now finds himself in an unexpected hitting slump. Epperson has gone 1-12 in the past three games to lower his batting average to .418, a drop from his previous clip of .441. Nevertheless, the senior still leads the Big West in batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>Epperson and junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa have provided the one-two punch on offense for the Gauchos. Kuresa leads the team with 33 RBIs, and his .574 slugging percentage and eight homeruns are second-best in league. He was one of the few productive bats in the lineup last weekend as he hit .400 in the series.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sophomore Dillon Tate has served as the shutdown closer this year with nine saves.</p>\n<p>Tate has been lights-out in his 21.2 innings of work. He has given up just one earned run on the season and has struck out 28 batters, well above one strikeout per inning. After last weekend’s shutout outing, Tate lowered his ERA to 0.83.</p>\n<p>“In that closer role he just pounds the zone and every team is going to have a really tough time hitting him,” Woodward said.</p>\n<p>First pitch for Friday’s game is scheduled for 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 24’s print edition of the Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/","id":4714,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4713,4712,4711],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":126,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
