Taking part in the very competitive NCAA Stanford Regional, Santa Barbara certainly had its fair share of struggles, finishing the competition in 11th place of the 13 teams that competed.</p>\n<p>Even though the low ranking meant an end to their season, the Gauchos certainly had a very successful 2016-17 season during which they won their first Big West title since 1998 and four other regular-season tournament championships. The five total titles are the most won in a single season in program history.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished Wednesday carding 8-over par 288, its best round at the Stanford Regional. As a whole, the team finished with a total 34-over par 874, finishing in front of Sacramento State’s 48-over par 888 and South Dakota State’s 59-over par 899.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Only four teams finished the tournament carding under par, with the winner of the Regional going to the host, Stanford, who tied for first with Baylor as they both carded 17-under 823. They will be advancing to the NCAA championship, along with third-place Pepperdine, fourth-place Oklahoma and fifth-place North Carolina, in hopes of attaining a national title.</p>\n<p>Individually, freshman Brett Bennett and junior Zach Smith each shot a 1-over par 71 in the final round to lead UCSB, while sophomore Nick Swanson finished with a 2-over par 72.</p>\n<p>Swanson and Bennett both were the highest-ranking Gauchos in the tournament, finishing 5-over 215 to tie for 33rd place out of the 75 competing athletes. Smith registered a 9-over par 219 to finish tied for 54th place. Junior Brandon Bauman finished tied for 65th with a 16-over par performance while junior Willy Moffly finished tied for 68th at 17-over par.</p>\n<p>The highest finish for an athlete from the Big West was UC Irvine’s David Kim, who finished the tournament tied for 20th place at 2-over par 212. Big West individual champion junior Felix Mory from Cal State Northridge also participated in the regional, finishing tied for 23rd after carding 3-over par 213.</p>\n<p>The winner of the Stanford Regional went to Oklahoma’s sophomore Brad Dalke, who carded a 12-under par 198 to take home first-place honors. Baylor’s freshman Cooper Dossey finished the competition at second place with a 9-under par performance, while Stanford’s senior Maverick McNealy shot at 8-under par to round out the top three.</p>\n<p>Despite the 11th-place finish, the Gauchos capped off one of the best seasons in UCSB history with all the tournament titles and individual accolades. However, the best part is probably the fact that they will return most of this starting team, and with young guys like Swanson and Bennett performing at a high level, the sky is the ceiling for next year’s team.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

He notes that his three consecutive ITF junior event victories were his most memorable sports moments and perhaps the turning point in his decision to take his craft to the next level.</p>\n<p>“I always wanted to play at the college level,” Mays said when asked about his transition into college. “To play for a team and be a part of a group environment was my goal.” Fast forward a few years and Mays would go on to achieve that goal.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>During his freshman year, Mays was recruited by Wake Forest University, whose team is currently ranked first in the nation according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association standings. His time there, however, was short-lived, as he ultimately decided to transfer to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“[Wake Forest] is a great school with a great tennis program, but I was looking for different opportunities like playing higher in the lineup — opportunities I would go on and receive here.”</p>\n<p>A chance to prove himself, and the ability to return back to the West Coast were all Mays could’ve asked for as he arrived at UCSB during the 2014-15 season.</p>\n<p>“When I came here I saw lots and lots of potential,” Mays said about his initial thoughts, “[and] a tight knit conference alongside an incredible coaching staff.”</p>\n<p>Mays went on to reference Head Coach Marty Davis’s own collegiate career and his status as a top-40 overall player and top 10 in doubles play. Paired with Assistant Coach Blake Muller and his illustrious career at Stanford, the team was led by some of the greatest former talents.</p>\n<p>“I was really excited when I got here … I saw everyone really intent on changing the culture here.” Mays mentioned because previous to the 2013 season, Santa Barbara was not yet the Big West powerhouse we see today. The team was also nonfactors at a national scale, with all of their recent NCAA Tournament appearances being cut short in the Round of 64 mark. Their last most successful showing came back in 1997 when UCSB was ranked No. 17 in the nation and reached the Sweet 16 stage of the competition. Since then, and from the turn of the century, the Gauchos haven’t really played at that same sense of quality.</p>\n<p>During his junior year, Mays first began to see himself consistently lead the pack at the roster’s court one spot. He also became captain for the first time as an upperclassman.</p>\n<p>“It was another opportunity I looked very much forward to; [captaining] is a position of high responsibility and it meant that much more considering we were coming off a great year since we had won the Big West title,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mays followed this up by making the point that, early on, every season the team wanted to see exactly where they’d stack up in the conference; however, their expectations began to involve a pursuit of placement onto the ITA rankings. That same year, Mays posted a 17-11 singles record and a 13-9 in dual play, which earned him an All-Conference First Team Singles selection and an Honorable Mention in Doubles. The team went on to qualify as their conference’s first seed and claimed back to back Big West championships. “</p>\n<p>Starting last year, with the bringing in of newer and younger faces, was when I saw the tennis program’s culture first begin to change,” Mays said.</p>\n<p>Mays was referring to standout names like sophomores Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno, as well as his doubles co-star junior Simon Freund. The identity of UCSB’s tennis program truly started to emerge as they began to set their goals high with a conference three-peat and potential upsets versus opposing top-tier programs.</p>\n<p>As this season’s campaign began to wind down, the accolades and record breaking began to pour in. UCSB’s late calendar win streak of 12 in a row handed them another Big West first seed which ultimately resulted in both a league and playoff clean sweep, granting the program their championship trifecta. Their overall season record of 19-6 had them at a .760 win percentage, which is the highest in franchise history and earned them the No. 37 ITA ranking. This national ranking finish also ended up being the program’s third-ever highest spot, with only the 1997 and 1998 teams both finishing top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“This was the first time in a while that people started to notice us on a national stage … we faced four different top-10 teams in the early part of the season and managed a great performance against all of them,” he said.</p>\n<p>All in all, Morgan Mays was once again elected to the All-Conference First Team and even announced as the Big West Player of the Year. Davis also earned 2017’s Coach of the Year recognition. Regionally speaking, ITA also honored Mays with the Arthur Ashe Leadership and Sportsmanship Award and Muller as Assistant Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Altogether it’s been an incredible year, I’m proud and I really believe the culture has shifted upwards from here. I truly think this program will excel and continue to win titles for years to come … all thanks to Marty and Blake, we all hope this mentality will keep growing.”</p>\n<p>Much praise can be passed on to the UCSB men’s tennis team, but there’s still more work left to be done. As for now, fans and Gauchos alike can surely be excited for more years of tennis court dominance thanks to a stellar youth core and a phenomenal coaching staff.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77938\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77938\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/","id":1206,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1205,1204,1203],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ball Is Life.

However, various sports news leaders continue to give LaVar a platform to utilize. Whether it be him defending the $495 price tag of Lonzo’s signature shoe or him making comparisons to Steph Curry or LeBron James, headlines have constantly played into LaVar’s ploy.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, the “Big Baller Brand” head honcho has done a good job of utilizing the exposure he has received. He’s been the mastermind of a publicity stunt that has enabled him to put the “BBB” brand on a pedestal that some support or hate.</p>\n<p>While the pricing for the “ZO2” signature shoe is too high, I respect the vision of the family business. The plan to invest in yourself is genius. Why not have complete creative control over how you mold and develop your own brand?</p>\n<p>Some may consider it costly considering that Nike, Under Armour and Adidas each decided not to sign Lonzo to a shoe deal. But self-investment is something no other player has done, with the closest being LeBron James and his lifetime deal with Nike.</p>\n<p>The vision is clear, but the logistics behind the brand will have to be altered in order for it to grow in the years to come. How to do so isn’t exactly clear at the moment due to the fact that Lonzo has yet to be drafted and even play a game in the NBA.</p>\n<p>After a decision that likely included the input of LaVar for Lonzo to not participate in the NBA Combine, it is no surprise that Lonzo will only work out for the Lakers prior to the NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>These are the circumstances that have left me with mixed emotions regarding LaVar’s role in Lonzo’s transition to the NBA.</p>\n<p>Although LaVar’s intentions surely aren’t meant to devalue his son’s talents, he has steadily added pressure to the already daunting expectations Lonzo is entering the league with, especially if he ends up going to the Lakers, who are looking to solidify a franchise player who will end their decline of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s unfair that people make claims in hopes of Lonzo being a bust or having an underwhelming career due to the actions of his father. Many presume that Lonzo’s laidback demeanor is a sign of submissiveness to his father or that of a kid who never had any say regarding his basketball career.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s the case or not cannot be determined. Yet, in the meantime, the battle between LaVar Ball and naysayers can only be resolved in a matter of time.</p>\n<p>And that’s to allow Lonzo’s game to speak for itself.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77942\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77942\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/","id":1889,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1888,1887,1886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season Review: UCSB Women’s Tennis Repeats as Big West Champs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite early season struggles, the UCSB women's tennis team made a few changes midway through the year which helped it get its groove back en route to its second straight Big West championship.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The remarkable run of the UCSB’s women’s tennis team officially has come to an end, leaving behind another successful season for the Gauchos.

Santa Barbara then went on a tear through the Big West Conference, stringing together wins against opponents like Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and Cal Poly. Of the seven regular-season conference games they played in April, the Gauchos swept their opponents 4-0 a total of four times.</p>\n<p>The impressive run of seven-straight victories carried Santa Barbara to the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, while three more wins to extend its streak to 10 matches led to an eventual return to the Big West Championships, during which the team played Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Hawaii was responsible for the Gauchos’ sole blemish in their conference record, and the matchup between the two teams was extremely competitive. However, it was UCSB who was able to answer back against the Rainbow Wahine by winning the conference final match 4-1. The finish at the top of the Big West Conference punched the team’s ticket to the first round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Results of the NCAA selection chose UCSB to face the No. 47 UCLA Bruins. The Bruins were a familiar opponent for the Gauchos, who had played them during their non-conference schedule. The Bruins were able to win that match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>The first-round meet between the two teams began with doubles play against the talented Bruin duo of freshman Ena Shibahara and junior Kristin Wiley. UCLA captured the doubles point after a loss by UCSB tandem junior Amanda Atanasson and senior Melissa Baker.</p>\n<p>In singles play, junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic tried to give the Gauchos an early leg up on the Bruins, but the play of No. 5 Shibahara and sophomore Alaina Miller was too much for the Gauchos’ standouts. Junior Terri Fleming clinched the meet for the Bruins after defeating Natalie Da Silveira. Yet again, it was the Bruins winning the match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>Despite the early exit for the Gauchos, the team is still poised to be a contender in both the Big West and the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The key players the Gauchos will be losing after this season are seniors Melissa Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson and Stefani Stojic. All three of these players were crucial to both UCSB Big West Championship titles and were key players in getting the team out of its regular-season slump this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end this season with a variety of accolades. The team has captured the first back-to-back conference titles since 1995 and 1996, which signaled the end years of UCSB’s six-straight Big West titles from 1991-96. The consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances were also the program’s first since then.</p>\n<p>It certainly was an exciting season to follow, as the women’s tennis program is taking steps toward returning to its glory of being one of the top-tier Big West teams.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/","id":1205,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1204,1203,1202],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Play Spoiler Against Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_Baseball-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_Baseball-9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With nothing but pride on the line, the Gauchos are looking to upset their longtime rival Cal Poly in its final home series of the season.

His power hitting was responsible for seven of the Gauchos’ 18 runs over the span of the four contests. His current mark of 14 homeruns leads the Big West and surpassed his former career-high of 11 last season. Collectively, the Gauchos rank second in the conference with 41 homers.</p>\n<p>Although Bush has managed to carry the offensive load for UCSB as of late, the Gauchos’ pitching core has been the victim of allowing a slew of runs during games in which they started off well but could not sustain their play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last three losses have included at least three allowed runs in a single inning. In the final game of its series against the Titans, UCSB allowed eight runs in the third, and in its weekday matchup against St. Mary’s it conceded nine runs in the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>The inconsistencies on the mound should be a cause of concern for the Gauchos as they prepare to face a Cal Poly team that thrives at the plate as it leads the conference in hits at 469 and is second in batting average with a .274 clip, on par with UCSB’s average.</p>\n<p>Hoping to capitalize on UCSB’s disappointing 5.15 ERA is the Mustangs’ sophomore outfielder Alex McKenna.</p>\n<p>Named to the Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American Team by <em>Collegiate Baseball Newspaper</em> in his freshman season, McKenna’s .357 hitting average ranks second-best in the Big West. Able to apply pressure when batting, he also is a threat when on-base as he is fifth in the conference with 12 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>What could be the most significant aspect of how the rivaled series will play out this weekend is the performance of the Mustangs’ pitching staff. More specifically, Cal Poly’s ability to not give up homeruns will be pivotal.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Mustangs have allowed a league-low 17 dingers and have been even more efficient during conference play with just four homeruns allowed.</p>\n<p>Setting the foundation to such a small allowance is Cal Poly’s heat on the mound as it sits atop the Big West with 410 strikeouts. Leading the Mustangs is the pitching duo of sophomore Spencer Howard and junior Erich Uelmen. Both rank second and third in the conference in strikeouts per nine innings as Howard averages 9.71 and Uelmen at 8.85, respectively.</p>\n<p>This past Saturday, Howard tallied Cal Poly’s first complete game of the season in a 5-2 win over CSUN. He threw 118 pitches, allowed seven hits, two earned runs and finished with 10 strikeouts. Uelmen has consistently held up his end as he has struck out 80 batters thus far, ranking third in the conference.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos possess the firepower to go hit-for-hit against Cal Poly, their fate ultimately comes down to how well they can challenge the Mustangs’ pitching.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry series will begin this Friday, May 19, at 3 p.m. The start time for Saturday’s game is 2 p.m., while Sunday’s closing game will begin at noon.

To fall after such a gorgeous performance from their pitching staff and a solid offensive day would have been disheartening, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Catch the ‘Chos back at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium on Friday at 3 p.m. as they take on their rival Mustangs to open an exciting Big West matchup series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77971\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-17/bush-muno-help-ucsb-ding-usc-6-5/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77971\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-17/bush-muno-help-ucsb-ding-usc-6-5/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-17/bush-muno-help-ucsb-ding-usc-6-5/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-17/bush-muno-help-ucsb-ding-usc-6-5/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-17/bush-muno-help-ucsb-ding-usc-6-5/","id":4040,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4039,4038,4037],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Begin Postseason Run in NISC Tournament Against Nevada","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the first game of their well-deserved postseason run, the Gauchos will meet Nevada on Tuesday, May 16, with the first pitch being set for 4 p.m. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_77037\" style=\"width: 465px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/gauchos-look-to-complete-successful-homestand-against-fresno-state/melanie-menor-lunges-for-a-ground-ball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77037\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77037\" data-attachment-id=\"77037\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/gauchos-look-to-complete-successful-homestand-against-fresno-state/melanie-menor-lunges-for-a-ground-ball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Melanie Menor lunges for a ground ball.

With a total of six regionals being hosted by programs across the nation, UCSB will only be one of the 26 teams participating. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Gauchos hold the best regular-season record in their respective conference of teams not playing in the NCAA tournament, they were given automatic qualification for the NISC this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Region 1, the Gauchos will compete against the Nevada Wolf Pack in their first game Tuesday. Santa Barbara rival Cal Poly will also be in Stockton for the NISC, along with Pacific, who is hosting the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 28-23 on the year, Nevada holds a similar record to UCSB, with a 13-11 conference record. The Wolf Pack is coming off of a disappointing end to the regular season, as they lost their final home series after being taken down by San Diego State two games to one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will be seeing the Nevada team for the second time this year, as the two teams played last on March 4 as part of the St. George Red Desert Classic. The matchup more than two months ago saw Santa Barbara win big 5-1 over the Wolf Pack. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the regular season has been any sort of an indicator, Santa Barbara will be getting a majority of help on Tuesday from junior Jessica Johnston, freshman Alyssa Diaz, senior Kristen Clark and sophomore Sierra Altmeyer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altmeyer leads the Gauchos in runs, home runs, and batting percentage, hitting .357 on the year. At 33 RBIs each, Johnston and Diaz will certainly draw attention from Nevada’s staff while preparing for the game, and Altmeyer is only one RBI behind. Another worry for the Wolf Pack staff will be Kristen Clark’s quickness off the bag, as the former Big West Conference Freshman of the year has stolen a total of 13 bases this season, more than double anyone else on UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the combination of Santa Barbara’s best seems intimidating, Nevada is expected to utilize one of their main weapons, Erika Hansen. The junior outfielder recorded 13 home runs and a bewildering 60 RBIs in the regular season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the outcome of Nevada’s game Tuesday and the Cal Poly-Pacific game later that day, Santa Barbara will face either Cal Poly or Pacific. Since the tournament is double elimination, teams can afford one loss and one win to still reach the regional final.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly is a team the Gauchos are undoubtedly familiar with, as we last played the Mustangs on April 2 as part of a conference series. The Gauchos lost the series, but they shut out the Mustangs while winning by a score of 4-0 in the final game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs went 34-19 overall this season while going 10-11 in the Big West, earning them a spot right behind the Gauchos in the conference tied for third.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly capped their regular season off with a win against UC Riverside, but they ultimately lost their last series against Riverside, only scoring one run in the first two games of the series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs must be looking to get back on track though, and they’ve proven they can perform for big games like the conference opener against the Gauchos back in April. Before dropping the Riverside series, Cal Poly had won its last two series against Davis and Hawaii, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they look to regain focus heading into the postseason, the Mustangs will be relying on strong performances from the senior pitcher and infielder Sierra Hyland. Hyland is batting .337 on the year while also leading the team in RBIs with 35. </span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara already has a rough feel for every team, as they have also played the Pacific Tigers this year. Back in February, as part of the Stanford Nike Invitational, the Gauchos bested the Tigers 10-9 in eight innings.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of the regular season, Pacific is 27-24 overall and 10-5 in conference play. While their record may not raise many eyebrows, the Tigers are on an incredible hot streak as they’ve won their past nine games in a row and held opponents to a single run or under in seven of the nine games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any team scouting Pacific will notice junior Sydney Lahners, who is averaging an impressive .523 slugging percentage. Lahners also leads the team in hits with 48 as well as recording a team-best 37 RBIs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first game of their well-deserved postseason run, the Gauchos will meet Nevada on Tuesday, May 16, with the first pitch being set for 4 p.m. Following the conclusion of that game, Cal Poly will take on their host, Pacific, at 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p>More information regarding the tournament game times and how to experience the Santa Barbara postseason in person can be found on the Pacific softball <a href=\"http://www.pacifictigers.com/sports/w-softbl/index\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77872\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77872\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/","id":33,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[32,31,30],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Final Series of Regular Season Against Conference Champ Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_DSC_1730-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_DSC_1730-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team finished its season this weekend with a competitive series at home against Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_77859\" style=\"width: 489px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/kayla-krantz-tosses-the-ball-toward-first-base-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77859\" data-attachment-id=\"77859\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/kayla-krantz-tosses-the-ball-toward-first-base-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_DSC_1730-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kayla Krantz tosses the ball toward first base.

Sophomore Gaucho pitcher Veronika Gulvin had to deal with a one-shot homer from junior infielder Shianne Brannan, then two unearned runs before closing out the inning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Titan center and infielder Sydney Colenzo hit a sac fly to center field, allowing her teammate, senior catcher Kylie Padilla, to score. Then, following a fielding error at second base, freshman infielder Emily Randall reached home to make the lead 3-0 heading into the bottom of second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the bottom of the sixth, still down by three runs, the Gauchos started making moves when they got the bases loaded. With Johnston up at bat, it seemed possible for Santa Barbara to get on the board, but Johnston exceeded expectations by getting the Gauchos a 4-3 lead off an incredible grand slam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite recording three errors on the day, the Gauchos held on to pull off the victory 4-3, not allowing Fullerton to answer back in the top of the seventh inning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Friday’s win, Santa Barbara went on to lose the second game of the series on Saturday, falling to Fullerton 6-5.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos struggled defensively in the game, making four errors just in the first four innings. Fullerton was first to strike again, scoring two runs thanks to an error made at second in the top of the third inning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With eight hits on the day, the Titans saw a lot of time on base, and, luckily for them, they transferred those hits into runs. </span></p>\n<p>Still in the top of the third, a foul out by freshman first-baseman Zoe Richard led to an unearned run for Fullerton. Then, an illegal pitch by the Gauchos extended the Titan lead by 4-0 with yet another unearned run.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While also notching eight hits on the day, the Gauchos struggled to convert their hits into runs.</span></p>\n<p>In the top of the fourth, junior outfielder Samantha Vandiver’s double to center brought in two more unearned runs, making the score 6-0 heading into the bottom of the fourth, during which the Gauchos again failed to score.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While quiet up to this point, the Gauchos stomped back in the bottom of the seventh, starting with senior infielder Emily Brucelas hitting a single to shortstop, bringing in freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz for the RBI and moving senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos to second base. On the board with a run, UCSB started catching fire. Cavazos scored off of a throwing error made by the Titans, and then Brucelas reached home for an unearned run off another throwing error. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still down by three runs, the Gauchos did their best to come back, nearly making it happen. Friday’s hero, Johnston, singled to left field, bringing in two unearned runs with senior outfielder Kristen Clark and freshman outfielder Nicole Marino reaching home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite their efforts, the comeback was cut short for the Gauchos as they fell 6-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second game on Saturday and the final game of the series, Santa Barbara junior pitcher Lena Mayer shut out the Titans, only allowing four hits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton had quite a different game than Game 2, as they struggled against Mayer and failed to score at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara, on the other hand, was able to finally score in the bottom of the sixth after struggling in the first five innings. In what involved a trio of UCSB’s best this season, Clark reached home, and Johnston reached second off of Diaz’s single up the middle. Then, sophomore infielder Melanie Menor hit a single up the middle of her own, bringing in Johnston for the score and game lead of 2-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It looked as if the Titans may make an effort at getting on the board in the seventh, as they had two runners on base with only one out. However, Mayer came up big with two straight strikeouts to end the game and series. Mayer shut out the Titans for the first time in their last 18 performances.</span></p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos fell in some games this season, their effort and hard work kept them close all year as they worked to improve upon last season and set another solid foundation for a successful season next year.</p>\n<p>In their final game at Campus Diamond, seniors Clark, Brucelas, senior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa and Cavazos were honored before Game 2, but they aren’t done yet as the Gauchos will participate in the inaugural NISC postseason Tournament which is set to begin Tuesday.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77865\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77865\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/","id":32,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[31,30,29],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"3rd Inning Blues: Gauchos Give up 8 Runs in 3rd Inning, Lose 4th Conference Rubber Match of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_vsNewMexicoSt-170324-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_vsNewMexicoSt-170324-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Riding the high of a 6-3 win on Saturday did not play a factor in this one as UCSB dropped its series against CSUF after suffering a 12-3 loss in the rubber match.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_77857\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/kenny-corey-races-to-first-base-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77857\" data-attachment-id=\"77857\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/kenny-corey-races-to-first-base-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_vsNewMexicoSt-170324-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kenny Corey races to first base.

Lincoln would also go 2.2 innings, but not because of a short leash. The pitch count rose quickly for Lincoln as he could not find the zone. The stuff was there showing a 90 to 91 mph fastball and good movement on both his slider and changeup, but most pitches would miss low or in the dirt.</p>\n<p>Lincoln would be a part of a rough third inning that would be a huge part in deciding the game early in favor of the home team. After getting two out in the bottom of the third, Lincoln would give up a dead-center two-run shot to Titan first baseman Taylor Bryant. After walking Timmy Richards, the Gauchos would go to their bullpen early.</p>\n<p>RHP Steven Ledesma, who has been lights out as of late before coming into Sunday’s matchup, was put in. After throwing 1.1 innings Friday and .2 innings Saturday, the transfer junior from Santa Barbara City College was noticeably tired while warming up only hovering around 85 to 86 mph with his fastball, a mark 2 to 3 mph lower than usual for the righty.</p>\n<p>As a result of fatigue, Ledesma got teed off on. Hunter Cullen would hit a bases-clearing triple to left center scoring two. The next batter Chris Hudgins would continue with a two-run shot to left field scoring two more.</p>\n<p>After a Chris Prescott single, Scott Hurst would hit <em>another </em>home run to right field adding yet two more runs for the Titans. Ledesma would not last the inning after giving up six runs from five batters. Ben Brecht would come in and finish the inning one batter later. The Titans would score eight two-out runs via a triple and three home runs in the bottom of the 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Gauchos would score three runs, but had opportunity after opportunity to score and make the game interesting. UCSB bats would leave the bases loaded scoring no runs on two separate occasions with one out. Even worse, the Gauchos were 0 for 5 with runners on 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> in the game. Although Kenny Corey would go 3 for 4, he would never be up with runners in scoring position resulting in no RBIS for the Gaucho 3<sup>rd</sup> baseman.</p>\n<p>Two more home runs and a triple would come again later in the game for the Titans resulting in the final score of 12 to 3. In total, even though collecting 14 hits, all runs produced for the Titans came on the five home runs and two triples given up. In the route, Lincoln (1-3) would get the loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to move on from the beat down and face the Trojans at the USC Wednesday night at 6 p.m. With using five arms including the usual midweek starter in Brecht Sunday, it will be interesting to see who the Gauchos will have left to throw considering a big Cal Poly series on the horizon at the end of the week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/","id":4114,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

With the Bruins capturing the early lead 1-0, the meet continued on to singles play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning singles play were two extremely talented players who have been crucial to their respective teams all season, UCLA’s No. 5 Shibahara and UCSB’s Dubavets.

Up next was Stojic’s turn to try to turn it around for the Gauchos in her match against Miller.

The end of the Gauchos’ season brings the graduation of seniors Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson oxford, and Stojic.

Then junior catcher Chris Hudgins stepped up with two outs and went deep with a three-run homer to add some insurance.</p>\n<p>This carried the Titans to a victory, as the score remained 8-4 from the last out of the sixth all the way through the ninth after Nelson was relieved by junior RHP Steven Ledesma (1-5, 5.77 ERA), who was then followed by freshman RHP Liam Steigerwald (0-0, 0.00 ERA).</p>\n<p>Ace Noah Davis is returning to UCSB’s rotation, after having been out on injury, for Saturday evening’s game at 7 p.m. which will be aired live on FOX Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have the potential to win this series and damage Cal State Fullerton’s chances at locking down a region bid with Cal Poly still just one game behind the Titans in Big West standings, but they will need to find some inspiration at the plate to do so.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The last series, they had two games of more than eight hits each with a total of two runs combined, as oftentimes base runners were left stranded in scoring position.</p>\n<p>Against a team like Fullerton, whose pitching staff has a combined 2.55 ERA and is led by senior Kelsey Kessler’s (19-6) incredible 1.39 ERA, leaving runs on the table is not an option, as opportunities to score will be few and far between.</p>\n<p>Kessler earned her third consecutive Big West Pitcher of the Week in the Titans’ outright claiming of the conference title. Prior to allowing a run in the second inning in Game 1 of the series against the Matadors, she had a streak of 32 straight scoreless innings in her complete game pitching performance.</p>\n<p>When at the plate, part of the difficulties UCSB has had with putting runs on the board has been the lack of production over the last two series from two of its best hitters: Jessica Johnston and Sierra Altmeyer.</p>\n<p>They went a combined 0-for-14 in the Gauchos’ two losses to UC Davis, with the sole victory in the series being powered by Johnston’s three RBIs. Although these last two series were most likely a fluke for these two, seeing as overall they have both put together two of the best individual seasons in the conference, it surely isn’t the way they want to end the year.</p>\n<p>Others throughout the lineup have stepped up, but UCSB is going to need production from their third-spot and cleanup hitter if it’s going to have a chance in this series.</p>\n<p>Even with their offensive struggles, the Gauchos still have a statistically better offense than the Titans coming into the game. Yet, this does not mean that the Santa Barbara pitching staff can overlook Fullerton despite the team’s numbers not being that impressive; the Titans certainly have some great offensive players.</p>\n<p>One of those players is infielder Lexi Gonzalez. The senior leads the Titans in doubles (9), home runs (10) and RBIs (39) and is second on the team in triples (1) and hits (48). She had three RBIs and five runs in the last series alone, and it is going to be up to the Gauchos to find a way to stop her.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be looking for redemption on the defensive end in this series, as it has not really performed up to its usual standards lately.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last loss came at the hands of four unearned runs, and against a Titan team that has lost only three conference matchups this year, the margin of error is going to be that much slimmer.</p>\n<p>However, one bright spot recently through all this was freshman Lena Mayer’s (3-1) great pitching performance against UC Davis, during which she pitched a complete game and only gave up one run. Hopefully, the Gauchos build off of that game and bring that same energy and control into this series.</p>\n<p>Although first place is out of reach for UCSB, this series gives the Gauchos an opportunity to showcase their talent against the top team in the Big West and possibly get up to second place.</p>\n<p>Fullerton is going to be a tough opponent, but if the Gauchos get back to their usual offensive groove and the pitching staff steps up in a big way, then there is no reason that they can’t take this series.</p>\n<p>Overall, this season has been a huge success for the UCSB softball team, as it has put together one the best offenses in the Big West and has had solid contributions from all of its pitchers. Now the Gauchos can go out one last time and make sure that the rankings show that.</p>\n<p>First pitch between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton is Friday, May 12, at 3 p.m. Saturday’s doubleheader will take place at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. The series will be played at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Gauchos played an exciting match, with the clinching point coming from a singles victory by freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p>The final victory in the month of April allowed the Gauchos to yet again raise the cup, a satisfaction surely made sweeter by beating the team that had been above them so often during the season. The Championship win also meant a perfect April for the UCSB women’s tennis team, as the team won all 10 games played, and they will surely carry that momentum into the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis program has not always experienced this kind of success. Last year’s Big West Championship became the program’s first in 20 years. The team had fallen into mediocrity after winning the Big West Championship six consecutive years from 1991-1996.</p>\n<p>The work toward obtaining the accolades UCSB has earned over the past couple of seasons can be traced back to five years ago, when longtime Fresno State Head Coach Simon Thibodeau was brought to Santa Barbara to lead the program.</p>\n<p>“Well, it was difficult to leave Fresno State, where we had a lot of success, and I was really trying to bring UCSB to the same level. I felt the school had even more potential due to the location and academic rank of this school,” Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>For the first three seasons of Thibodeau’s career, the team went 39-34, during which it was bounced out of the tournament every single season; the conference final was its highest mark yet.</p>\n<p>However, it was in this period of time when Thibodeau began to recruit players who would grow to be important pieces of the current winning formula at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson were added in 2013 and Natalie Da Silveira became a Gaucho in 2014. The 2015 additions to the squad included Amanda Atanasson, Palina Dubavets, Stefani Stojic and Yamada.</p>\n<p>“We also had a donor who boosted our scholarship amount, so we were able to go get a few more players like Palina, Amanda and Stefani Stojic, who are all transfers, and we gained some budget in their scholarship, so I was able to get more top players and I was able to compete at the highest level.”</p>\n<p>All of these players have been critical to UCSB’s rise to the top of the Big West Conference, and Thibodeau credits an increase in funding from UCSB donors as the primary reason the women’s tennis program is able to acquire highly talented transfers such as Dubavets and Stojic.</p>\n<p>“We really try to make this program the full package for any prospect in the world that wants to go study in the U.S. and play tennis. We’re getting closer; we would like to build more facilities in the future, but that’s the next step in terms of fundraising.”</p>\n<p>The current tennis roster boasts seven international players out of the current 12 roster spots, a sign of the increased ability of the program to attract better prospects.</p>\n<p>“Most of the best teams in the tournament are all fully funded in their scholarships. They have the NCAA limitation of eight full in/out of state scholarships for their players. That was not the case here when I took the program, and we really needed to fundraise to get to the amount that most of the big programs have.”</p>\n<p>Headed into the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos are looking to see how they will measure up to this top-25 talent showcased throughout the NCAA tournament and are hoping that the increased experience coming off of last year’s tournament exit will propel them farther than the second round.</p>\n<p>“We feel that we are just one player away from being able to compete with the top 16 teams in the country, and we hope to be at that level in the years to come.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77781\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77781\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/","id":1201,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1200,1199,1198],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lights, Anthem, Action: UCSB Goes to Cal St. Fullerton for Big Weekend Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_vsNevada-170411-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_vsNevada-170411-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The highly anticipated series all year long between CSUF and UCSB is set to take place this weekend with two games being nationally televised.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_77706\" style=\"width: 439px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-09/ucsb-preps-for-road-match-against-st-marys/ben-brecht-throws-a-fastpitch-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77706\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77706\" data-attachment-id=\"77706\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-09/ucsb-preps-for-road-match-against-st-marys/ben-brecht-throws-a-fastpitch-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_vsNevada-170411-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ben Brecht throws a fastpitch.

The UCSB baseball team, which currently sits at 20-25, will be heading to Cal State Fullerton to face the No. 15 nationally ranked Titans, who are 29-16.</p>\n<p>Games 1 and 2 of the three-game series will be aired on national television, with ESPNU providing coverage on the opening game and FOX Sports Prime Ticket for the second matchup. Game 3, which begins Sunday at 1 p.m., has yet to have any scheduled TV broadcasting. Some may wonder why there’s so much hype surrounding the upcoming series considering the fact that the Gauchos don’t have much to play for; however, there are a few reasons why one should pay attention to the slate of games.</p>\n<p><strong>1) The Gauchos will be playing inspired baseball. </strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>You can bet your bottom dollar that UCSB is sick and tired of hearing about how amazing Cal State Fullerton has been all season long. After coming off a College World Series campaign, the pain of another school within your own conference potentially being able to experience the same thing you did last year is a deep one, especially if you’re one of the returners. To compensate, the Gauchos will be fired up while going into enemy territory to take on the No. 15 team in the country.</p>\n<p><strong>2) UCSB Baseball has a lot of pride on the line.</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach Andrew Checketts and his coaching staff will not be playing around with their lineup during this series as we have seen lately. Expect to see a lineup similar to what we have seen all year long. Guys on the DL, such as junior second baseman Colton Burns and sophomore ace Noah Davis, might make an appearance knowing that this series can give momentum to the team heading into next year. As much as coaches and players will tell you until they’re blue in the face about how last year’s series don’t matter, they do and people remember.</p>\n<p><strong>3) The ‘Chos have an opportunity to play spoiler.</strong></p>\n<p>As it stands, the Titans are second place in the Big West Conference with a 10-5 conference record on the tail of Long Beach State. On top of this, Cal Poly is only one game behind Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have the fun opportunity to ruin a potential region bid for CSF and play spoiler. If UCSB wins the series, Cal Poly can take its spot in second while Long Beach State can run away with the conference. This would be a monumental blow, considering Cal State Fullerton was once ranked as high as No. 4 in the nation after beating some competitive teams poised to contend deep into the season.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Friday, the projected starter for the Gauchos is junior left-handed pitcher Kyle Nelson. Nelson’s last outing against UC Davis was fantastic; he got the win, going nine full innings while giving up three earned runs and striking out six in the process.</p>\n<p>Nelson will square off against the Titans’ junior ace Connor Seabold. Seabold is 7-4 on the year with a 2.81 ERA.  In the righty’s last start, Seabold got the win at Hawaii, pitching eight innings, giving up one earned run and striking out seven.</p>\n<p>The series will continue the next day, during which Noah Davis is expected to return to the rotation. The sophomore has been out for a couple of weeks with an undisclosed injury, but in his last outing on April 21 against San Diego State, Davis pitched impressively, going 7.1 innings with one earned run and six strikeouts.</p>\n<p>His anticipated competition is CSUF’s John Gavin, a lefty with a 5-2 record and 3.33 ERA. Gavin’s last outing was also against Hawaii, but the junior Titan lost the decision, pitching six innings and giving up four earned runs to the Rainbow Warriors. However, the lefty did strike out eight.</p>\n<p>Make sure to tune in to watch some of the best baseballs the Gauchos will face this season. In many ways, this series will be a benchmark for what’s to come from the team moving forward, as many players are expected to return next season.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/","id":4260,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on Dec. 6, 1994, Antetokounmpo was only 18 years old when he was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, making him the youngest in the 2013 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>However, his rise to stardom started inside of Greece’s second division basketball league. Here he managed a 9.5 points and 5.0 rebounds per game average over 26 total games for Filathlitikos, which sparked conversation as his potential began to be noticed. Spanish clubs like Barcelona and Zaragoza then began to show their interest in him and touted his prodigious ability.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Antetokounmpo remained in Greece until the conclusion of the 2012-13 season. His next move was then perhaps the wisest decision of his life: become eligible for the NBA Draft. Then the rest was history.</p>\n<p>Well, not exactly history. Presently, Antetokounmpo is respected and perhaps even feared by his peers, but let’s look at the early moments of his professional career.</p>\n<p>Following his first round, No. 15 overall selection by the Bucks, Antetokounmpo gradually made an impact on the court. In his first three NBA seasons he averaged 12.1 points, 3.0 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. Not particularly standout numbers, however, he earned enough accolades along the way to promote his projection toward greatness.</p>\n<p>In his rookie year, he totaled 61 blocks which led all rookies in the NBA, thus earning himself a spot on the All-Rookie Second Team roster. His physical prowess was first recognized during his sophomore season when he was invited to participate in the NBA Slam Dunk contest. Later that year, Antetokounmpo also helped his team achieve its first playoff win since its 2009-10 campaign. In just his third season, he etched himself into Milwaukee Bucks history with the most triple-doubles in a single season.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t look like he’s sweating or even breathing hard,” Bucks Head Coach Jason Kidd said when interviewed about Giannis’ play, “and that shows just how talented he really is.”</p>\n<p>Over the years, Giannis has received similar praise from his idols like Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson; however, none as directly valuable as from the King himself: LeBron James.</p>\n<p>“A guy that can handle the ball at that size is special … at that speed, with his length. I think J-Kidd does a great job of placing him in the lineup where he sees a mismatch, and so he’s all over the floor.”</p>\n<p>This quote not only puts Antetokounmpo’s young and outstanding career into perspective, but also brings us to his comparisons with LeBron, currently the best player in the game.</p>\n<p>Yes, best player in the game. Sure he may not be in MVP contention amongst the names of Russell Westbrook and James Harden; but no one else can match LeBron’s level of speed and power. Well, perhaps Antetokounmpo will one day.</p>\n<p>In terms of this regular season’s production, the pair each had noteworthy seasons. LeBron averaged 26.4 points, 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game whereas Antetokounmpo maintained an average of 22.9 points, 5.4 assists and 8.7 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The two also started side by side in the 2017 NBA All-Star Game as members of the first team roster. When the Cavaliers visited the Bucks back in November, Antetokounmpo led his team to a 118-101 victory after scoring a total of 34 points, 12 rebounds, five steals, five assists and two blocks all whilst being matched up with LeBron. The two later acknowledged each others efforts with a respectful post-game hug, but from watching that game one can tell how special Antetokounmpo will be.</p>\n<p>As for the remainder of Giannis’s season this year, he scored a career high of 41 points in a February game against the Lakers, became the youngest All-Star in franchise history and, most especially, led his team in all five of the major record categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.</p>\n<p>Altogether Antetokounmpo’s athletic skills and raw talent can only pose a resemblance to LeBron’s. Each player has a unique capacity to strike panic into opponents when they’re headed toward the rim with both size and speed.</p>\n<p>However, it can be understood that in both statistic and legacy, Antetokounmpo has a while to go before catching up to LeBron. Although, he still has plenty of time to do so as he’s only 22 years old.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77766\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77766\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/","id":1888,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1887,1886,1885],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":49,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
