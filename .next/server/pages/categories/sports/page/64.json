And in some cases, a fresh start is exactly what some teams need now that conference play has come to the forefront of the action. With championship bragging rights and a NCAA invitation bid on the line, these nine Big West foes will be battling all season in order to prove they are the better team, at least for this year. Whether UC Riverside will repeat as champs, or another squad will dethrone them, one thing is for sure, these conference match-ups will be some of the most intense basketball these teams have faced all season. With that being said the Daily Nexus Sports Staff presents a preview of each Big West squad, enjoy! <strong><em>Note: With the exception of UCSB, who was ranked No. 4, the rest of the teams are ordered from first to last according to the Big West coaches preseason polls.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Barbara – Sean White </strong></p>\n<p>Now two games into its Big West Conference schedule, currently 6-9 overall and 1-1 in conference play, the UCSB women’s basketball team is hoping to build upon last year’s postseason return.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos returned to the Big West Conference Tournament for the first time since 2013 after a 12-20, 8-8 conference finish last season. Winners in four of its last six games, UCSB managed to gain some momentum after going on a three-game winning streak but was unable to sustain its momentum heading into conference play with a 64-60 loss in its final nonconference game to Yale.</p>\n<p>Projected to finish seventh in the Big West Preseason Media Poll, the Gauchos are better geared for the conference schedule after an improved nonconference finish in year two with Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. Santa Barbara improved by one win after a 4-12 nonconference finish during its 2015-16 campaign.</p>\n<p>Set to begin a three-game home stand versus UC Riverside this Saturday, UCSB’s home stay at the Thunderdome is a pivotal opportunity for the Gauchos to move up in the conference rankings.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Gauchos allow an average of 60.2 points per game when playing at home. UCSB has crafted one of the toughest defenses in the Big West as it ranks second in points allowed per game (64.0) and third in opponent three-point percentage (28.8).</p>\n<p>Although UCSB hasn’t found much consistency offensively, ranking third last in scoring with a PPG average of 60.1, the emergence of sophomore guard Coco Miller has been significant in the team’s performance.</p>\n<p>Miller leads the Gauchos in scoring at 11.3 PPG. She has already tied her previous season-high mark of two 20-plus point games after recording a career-high 24 points versus Pepperdine and 23 points on the road at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The addition of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman has provided the Gauchos with a post presence, a feature that had been missing on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s 53.4 field goal percentage ranks third in the Big West. She has tallied three double-doubles thus far and recorded a career-high 20 points in the Gauchos’ victory over NAU earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 14 at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Ryan Burns </strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Long Beach women’s basketball team has enjoyed an impressive start to their season at 10-6 overall, 1-0 Big West, including a pair of wins over LMU and Nevada, proving themselves as an early contender for the Big West Crown. The Niners have also been tested against the nation’s very top teams including Duke and Florida, gaining valuable experience on the biggest stage.</p>\n<p>The team is led by senior forward Madison Montgomery who leads the team with 11.4 ppg on .456 shooting percentage, also a team high. The forward has shown marked improvement since last season when she finished the year with 8.6 points a game on .376 shooting. Behind Montgomery stand senior guard Raven Benton (10.2 ppg) and senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer, the team’s leading rebounder with 6.9 boards per game.</p>\n<p>The trio of seniors link up to form a strong core of a team with high ambitions, hoping to leave with titles to show for their 49ers careers following last year’s 24-9 finish (12-4 BWC). Coming off a loss to Hawaii in the conference tournament and Oregon in the WNIT, leaving them with a bit of revenge to seek as Big West play tips off.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>No doubt, one of the biggest threats in the Big West women’s conference this season is the UC Davis squad, which was expected to finish in second place behind LBSU in the Big West standings at season’s end.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have put together a solid year thus far, boasting an 11-4 overall record and a 2-0 start in conference play after blowout wins against UC Irvine and Hawaii. They are also currently winners of five of their last six games.</p>\n<p>Although UC Davis only has five upperclassmen on the roster, the team is not short on talent. One example of this is redshirt sophomore Morgan Bertsch, who is following up an excellent rookie campaign with an even better second year as she is leading the Big West in points per game with 17.5. She also leads her squad in rebounding with 5.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>This year, the Aggies have been great on the offensive end as a team outscoring their opponents by over 100 points at 1097-969. They currently lead the Big West in points per game with 73.1 and currently hold the best assists per game as well at 17.1.</p>\n<p>UC Davis will face off against Long Beach State in what could be the game that decides the Big West winner on Thursday, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Andrew Hernandez</strong></p>\n<p>Coming off of a disappointing early playoff exit in the 2016 Big West Conference tournament, the UC Riverside Highlanders look to repeat as Big West Conference regular season champions despite losing two-time Big West Player of the Year Brittany Crain.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders won their home Big West opener and are currently 1-0 in conference play, looking to leave behind a 7-7 record in nonconference play. The Highlanders’ win increased their regular season game winning streak — which dates back to last season — to 17.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have been depending on seniors Réjane Vérin and Simone DeCoud, who were on the 2016 Big West Conference First and Second Teams, respectively, to lead their offense.</p>\n<p>“Vérin and DeCoud are the engines that drives our team’s success,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “We need them to produce with consistency for us to be successful and to allow our role players to fill in and contribute.”</p>\n<p>Vèrin, the team’s starting forward, scored 21 points, hauled in 10 rebounds and had seven assists in the Highlanders’ last game. The talented senior is currently leading the team in the blocks, points, assists and rebounds per game categories. Senior guard DeCoud is right behind Vérin as she is second in those same categories.</p>\n<p>UCR continues its road to Big West dominance when it faces Cal Poly in its second conference game of the season tonight at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>Capturing its seventh NCAA Tournament bid and first Big West Championship title since 1996 last season, the University of Hawaii has big shoes to fill following the departure of its five seniors and a 21-11 finish.</p>\n<p>Projected to land in the middle of the pack, selected to finish in fifth place in the preseason coaches’ poll, Head Coach Laura Beeman is mindful of the time it takes young teams like hers to develop and replicate a winning culture.</p>\n<p>“We’ve put last year behind us,” Beeman said. “We’re a totally different team now with new players looking to establish their own identity. We want to formulate our own traditions and use that as a springboard for this season and the next.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine sit at 4-10 on the year and 0-2 in conference play following a 68-57 loss to league favorite Long Beach State last Thursday.</p>\n<p>With a team that featured three All-Big West selections last year including Big West All-Tournament MVP Ashleigh Karaitiana, the pressure is on for upperclassmen junior guard Sarah Toeaina and senior point guard Briana Harris. Toeaina has emerged as an offensive catalyst for the Rainbow Wahine averaging 11.8 ppg. Hawaii will face Fullerton this Thursday at 7 p.m. HT.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>Since winning back-to-back Big West tournament titles in 2014 and 2015, Cal State Northridge’s reign at the top of the conference has gradually diminished. The loss of talent after winning its pair of conference titles is what influenced CSUN’s downward spiral last season.</p>\n<p>After a fairly dreadful 2015-16 season in which the Matadors finished 7-24 and 5-11 in conference play, this season has certainly been an improvement for a young team featuring only one senior.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 8-8, 1-1 in the Big West, the Matadors are up showing many naysayers by being at the .500 mark. Despite not being consistent enough to achieve a winning streak beyond two games, Northridge has still played strong following its losses. Only twice this season has the team lost consecutive games.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the Mustangs’ Big West slate saw them handle Cal State Fullerton 58-41, before falling to Cal Poly 79-68. Sophomore center Channon Fluker has paced her team in points, scoring 15.3 per game on 49.3 percent shooting in just over 24 minutes per contest. She also averages a double-double, raking in a conference leading 11.1 rebounds a game, which also ranks as the most on her team by a sizable margin.</p>\n<p>Fluker’s post game is accompanied by redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe’s perimeter shooting ability, as her 39 three-pointers made leads for the team and contributed to her average of 11.5 points per contest.Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Despite several impressive performances on the year, including losing to Michigan State (12-4) by only four points, two-time Big West Coach of the Year Jason Flowers, and the Matadors seem to have a viable chance to return to their winning ways in 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball may not have begun their 2016-2017 season the way they wanted to, but they are now currently tied with UC Davis for first place in the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>After Saturday’s 79-68 win over the visiting CSUN Matadors, Cal Poly is off to an impressive 2-0 start in Conference play. This turnaround mentality is exactly what the Mustangs were looking for as they exited the preseason at a meager 4-8.</p>\n<p>“Our pre-season had quite a few challenges. I would have hoped that we would have learned at a quicker pace considering that we had so many returners,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “The good news is that we have been learning and improving.”</p>\n<p>The improvements are evident as three different players have found themselves in the top 5 of the Big West’s Individual Offense Leaders category.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe places fifth overall points per game for the Big West (14.9), just as her sister, junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, is second overall in Rebounds per Game (8.1). Coach Mimnaugh is impressed with the initiative these twins convey and how their talent complements the skills of fellow teammates.</p>\n<p>The third offensive leader is senior forward Hannah Gilbert, who is also praised for her defensive ability. Coach Mimnaugh also believes that Gilbert’s performance so far should warrant her consideration for Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Mustangs current showing promotes the notion that the team is headed in the right direction whilst being led by a splendid coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“We have an unselfish, hard-working group who have bought into the roles they play … a great sign for continuing to strengthen chemistry and teamwork,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>This week, Cal Poly will look to extend their undefeated streak on Thursday, Jan. 12, on the road against UC Riverside at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>It was only three years ago that the UC Irvine women’s basketball team picked to finish eighth in the Big West preseason poll, surprised everyone by going 9-7 in conference play and managing to pick up a postseason victory in an overtime game against UC Davis in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Picked again to finish eighth this year, that recent history suggests it would be foolish to assume that the Anteaters will meekly fall into their predicted position.</p>\n<p>Early returns indicate that if UC Irvine does indeed defy this year’s preseason predictions, it might be in the opposite direction of what they did in 2013-14. The Anteaters entered conference play sporting a conference-worst 2-12 record and two ugly losses to UC Davis by a score of 89-48 and UC Riverside 76-58 haven’t helped matters.</p>\n<p>If Irvine stands a chance of turning things around and emulating that 2013-14 season, it will be on the strength of senior Shereen Sutherland, junior Sabrina Engelstad and sophomore Andee Ritter who are all averaging double digits in points per game.</p>\n<p>Sutherland, a 6’2” forward, is averaging a team-high 6.9 rebounds per game, while Engelstad leads the squad in blocks. Rounding out the trio, Ritter has come up with a team-leading 2.3 steals per game.</p>\n<p>These three players will be the key to a massive turnaround for first-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue’s team. The Anteaters have not helped themselves much so far this year, but UC Irvine of all teams should know that it’s still possible to defy expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>After a tough 2015-16 season, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team has entered conference play with a two-game losing streak but looks to improve as the season progresses. So far, they sit at a 3-12 record, similar to their overall record of 3-27 last year.</p>\n<p>Despite recent losses, the team has increased their average points scored per game from 55.8 to 60.7 and improved their field goal percentage from 35.5 to 37.9 since last year.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ top scorers — senior guard Iman Lathan, junior center Daeja Smith, and senior guard Jordan Jackson — lead their team despite having not played last season. Grabbing a combined score of 38 points in their most recent conference game against the Gauchos, they also have the most playing time alongside sophomore guard Jade Vega and senior guard China Henderson.</p>\n<p>With only three wins under their belt this season, the Cal State Fullerton Titans have room to improve their record and play on the court. Their next game will be at the University of Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 12.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74737\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74737\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/","id":293,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[292,291,290],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Eyeing First Conference Win of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-5.07.54-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-5.07.54-PM.png?resize=957%2C568&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on UCI at the Thunderdome tonight in hopes of picking up their first conference win of the season and its third win overall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Desperate to turn around what has been a lackluster season thus far, the UCSB men’s basketball team will have a great opportunity tonight as it faces off against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hosts the visiting Irvine team with an overall record of 2-11 so far and a 0-1 start to Big West play after a blowout loss of 73-47 at UC Davis last Wednesday.

Despite UCSB holding a 51-35 advantage all-time over UCI, the two teams have certainly been evenly matched over the past four years, splitting their last eight match-ups.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are the hotter team coming into this match, as they are winners of their last four ball games in which they averaged 82.2 points per game and outscored their opponents 329-223.</p>\n<p>As a team, UC Irvine’s stats rank among some of the best in the Big West in different categories, proving it is a team that can excel in all facets of the game, as it is second in the league in blocks per game (3.8), third in rebounds per game (39.2) and fourth in assists per game (13.2).</p>\n<p>Irvine’s scoring leader this season has been senior guard Jaron Martin who scores the sixth-most points per game in the conference, averaging 14 a game. On the rebounding side, sophomore forward Jonathan Galloway who ranks third in the Big West — second if you exclude UCSB’s junior forward Jalen Canty who is out indefinitely due to academic ineligibility — averaging 6.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the court, UCSB ranks among the bottom in many of the major categories in the Big West. This season, the Gauchos are eighth place in the conference in points per game (64.2), steals (5.0) and rank dead last in field goal percentage (36.7), three-point percentage (27.8) and free-throw percentage (61.4). In fact, Santa Barbara’s field goal percentage and three-point percentage rank 344 out of the 347 teams in Division I College Basketball, while its free-throw percentage ranks 341st.</p>\n<p>One of the two stats that which the Gauchos rank near the top in is rebounds per game. They are currently second in the Big West in that category averaging 39.4 boards as a team, but with the losses of their two best big man down low, Canty, and sophomore forward Ami Lakoju, to academic ineligibility, one could only surmise that they will not fare well much longer.</p>\n<p>If UCSB has any hope tonight, then it will need a big game from junior guard Gabe Vincent. The former Big West Freshman of the Year is the team’s leading scorer and the Big West’s second-best scorer averaging 15.8 points per game. In five home games this season, Vincent has done significantly better from three-point range, shooting 36 percent from the field as opposed to 27.7 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Guard Max Heidegger would also be a welcomed addition. The true freshman has been a bit inconsistent this season but has certainly shown flashes of greatness, scoring 21 points in an overtime home victory against Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>With a lackluster start comes huge scrutiny, and no one is facing more of Head Coach Bob Williams. Many fans have taken to social media to show their distaste for Williams after such a bad start to the season.</p>\n<p>However, winning changes all fortunes and a huge victory against UC Irvine tonight would be a huge step in the right direction for everyone involved with this program.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UC Irvine at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 12 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UC Irvine trampled UCSD earlier in the month, while Grand Canyon came in to San Diego and left with a 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>Those two losses came despite the best efforts of freshman Devin Pontigon, who led his team in kills both matches, and has posted a sterling 3.86 points per set so far this year. Pontigon will be the focus of much of the Gauchos’ defense on Friday, although upperclassmen Ian Colbert (a senior with a team-high three aces) and Tanner Syftestad (a junior who’s second on the team with 12 kills) will attract some serious attention as well.</p>\n<p>Junior setter Milosh Stojcic has done an excellent job in setting up the Triton offense in UCSD’s first two games, posting 63 assists at a sturdy clip of nine assists per set.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Casey McGarry isn’t too far behind Stojcic in that department. The freshman has 8.50 assists per set of his own, and a team-high 119 assists. Toss in fellow freshman Randy DeWeese, averaging seven assists per set himself, and the Gauchos have a young setter stew going.</p>\n<p>Both McGarry and DeWeese will be crucial to the rebound effort on Friday. UCSB’s big hitters, including redshirt senior Jacob Delson, junior Hayden Boehle and redshirt sophomore Henri Cherry, are all reliant on their setters to keep the offense flowing and the Gauchos winning.</p>\n<p>Delson holds a commanding lead in the UCSB kills department with 68, 22 more than Boehle, his closest teammate. Delson’s doing it at a better rate than even Pontigon is for UCSD, racking up 4.25 kills per set in four games.</p>\n<p>If UCSB wants to rebound from Wednesday’s tough loss, it’s going to need strong performances from everybody on the offensive chain. The Gauchos proved they can hang with some of the highest ranked teams in the nation on Wednesday, but now they need to show that they can take a defeat from one of those teams and keep on ticking.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UCSD on Friday night, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. at Robertson Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/no-12-ucsb-in-search-of-first-mpsf-victory-at-home/","id":5004,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5003,5002,5001],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Aiming to Improve Slow Start Against UC Davis in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite boasting a 2-10 record coming into this Big West opener, UCSB looks to start the new year off right with a fifth straight win against UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Just days since the beginning of a new year, the UCSB men’s basketball team is ready to start 2017 fresh as tonight it takes on UC Davis in the first of 16 Big West conference games this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos come into the contest with a 2-10 overall record after blowing a 20-point lead in their last outing against Seattle University on December 30<sup>th</sup>.

In fact, UCSB’s non-conference strength of schedule ranks 20<sup>th</sup> in the nation according to ESPN’s latest poll, the highest of any Big West team, with fellow conference counterpart Long Beach State sitting only five slots behind at 25 and sits at 5-11 after non-conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite having a clearly better overall record coming into this match-up, the Aggies NCSS (non-conference strength of schedule) ranked 301<sup>st</sup> of the 347 teams eligible in Division I college basketball.</p>\n<p>All-time, the Gauchos have owned the match-up between these two teams dating back to 1939 winning 28 of the 34 games played. Last season, UCSB defeated UC Davis three times during its nine-game winning streak including a regular season sweep and defeating them once more in the first round of the Big West Tournament 87-61.</p>\n<p>In order to repeat such dominance against a formidable opponent, Santa Barbara will need to rely heavily on the presence of point guard Eric Childress and shooting guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>Being the only senior on the team, Childress will certainly need to lead the example now that conference play has arrived. He currently ranks first on the team in three-point shooting percentage (37.5) assists (3.8) and steals (1.4) while averaging the second most minutes of anyone on the team (32.6).</p>\n<p>As a sophomore last season, Vincent averaged 18 points per game in three match-ups against the Aggies, shooting 45 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range. His worst performance, however, came at UC Davis where he only scored 13 points on 3-11 shooting and missed all four of his three-point attempts.</p>\n<p>Coming into this match, the junior is averaging 16.2 points per game, the highest on the team, but his shooting percentage only ranks ninth highest among his squad.</p>\n<p>As a team, one of the biggest things the Gauchos will need to change is their three-point shooting. Despite Childress and Vincent each shooting above 30 percent, the team ranks 336 out of 347 in the nation in three-point percentage at 28.7. In their two wins this season, UCSB shot a combined 40 percent from three-point range, indicating that when the three-ball is rolling, so it the team.</p>\n<p>Wanting to avenge the three losses from last season, the Aggies will look to rely on senior Brynton Lemar. The guard is second on the team in points per game (14.2) and put up some of his best performances last season against the Gauchos including his first career double-double last year at the Thunderdome with a 16 point and 11 rebound — another career high — performance.</p>\n<p>Another big name to watch out for is forward Chima Moneke who was awarded Big West Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career after averaging 17 points and 12 rebounds last week in two winning efforts. The junior transfer ranks first on the team in points (14.9) and rebounds (8.3).</p>\n<p>The new year brings about new hopes in fans that UCSB can turn around this season and make the most of it despite missing forwards Jalen Canty and Ami Lakoju after being ruled ineligible to play due to academic reasons. Having not won a Big West regular season title since 2009, it certainly would be a treat to win it this year with such a young team and after such a slow start.</p>\n<p>UCSB tips off conference play against UC Davis at The Pavillion on Wednesday, January 4<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

He would finish the night with 10 points, four assists, and six rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contributions off the bench were also a big factor in the Gauchos 47-point first half outburst as freshman guards Clifton Powell and Max Heidegger had seven and eight points, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In what could’ve been one of the turning points of the game had UCSB not lost, Powell scored five straight points, off of two sweet dishes from Vincent, in the final minute to help the Gauchos take a 47-33 lead into the break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For most of the second half, the Gauchos seemed to be in complete control of the game. Although Seattle had cut it to eight with 15:53 left after a 12-6 run to kick off the final frame, Santa Barbara responded with 16-4 run over the next six minutes to take a commanding 69-49 lead with 9:37 left to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final 9:37 proceeded to be a painful experience for those who had hope that Gaucho basketball was finally turning the corner this year as they were outscored 31-7 in the final 9:37. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all started with a convincing 14-0 run by Seattle University that brought them within six with 4:52 left. Sophomore guard Zack Moore was huge knocking down two three balls while senior </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forward </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">William Powell came up with four huge rebounds and knocked in two big free throws during that 14-0 run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Seattle cut the lead back down to single digits and had hope, it was redshirt senior guard Brendan Westendorf who broke the heart of all UCSB fans in the building scoring 13 straight points, including knocking down three consecutive three-point shots to give his team a 72-71 advantage with 2:04 left.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After taking the lead the Redhawks never looked back, finishing off the Gauchos with a clutch free throw shooting down the stretch and winning the game 80-76. Westendorf finished with 28 points on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing pains are expected with this young Santa Barbara team, who is now even more limited after the losses of Ami Lakoju and Jalen Canty, but this one was especially painful. After shooting 9-20 from three in the first half, the Gauchos shot an abysmal 3-17 from deep in the second half, dooming what once seemed an easy victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was also a tough finish for Vincent who scored no points in the second half and went 0-5 from three. In fact, it was a tough final half for every Gaucho as no player had double figures in the second half. Heidegger led the team with nine second half points but shot a below average 3-10 from the field in doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could only hope that with the new year approaching and conference play starting next week, the under-manned, young UCSB squad will tap into its full potential as it did last year, getting hot at just the right time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos next game will be at UC Davis in the Big West opener on Wednesday, Jan. 4 at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi comes in at 4-5 as it is on a current two game slump. Able to recently overcome a nine game losing streak is North Dakota State as it sits at 2-9.</p>\n<p>Providing the most consistency has been the Gauchos’ backcourt duo of senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Although not widely known for their scoring abilities, with Jemerigbe and Toler averaging 8.4 and 6.9 points per game, respectively, the two have efficiently distributed the ball to create scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe’s total of 39 assists is tied for first in the Big West, while Toler’s 35 dimes ranks fourth in the conference. Both also rank in the top 10 of the conference in assists per game with Jemerigbe in second with an average of 3.9 and Toler in fifth at a 3.5 average.</p>\n<p>Most recently, it was Toler that emerged to get UCSB over its losing woes with the game-winning jumpshot in the team’s victory over Fresno State on Friday. She has been a pivotal asset in the Gauchos’ bench rotation as her PPG average leads all second unit players.</p>\n<p>Coming off its season-high three-point percentage of 50 percent in its win, it is likely UCSB will attempt to maintain its hot hand from long distance. On average, the Gauchos make 7.1 three-pointers per game and are just two three-pointers short of being tied with UC Davis for second place in total three-pointers made this season with a current mark of 71.</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara’s three-point attack is redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter. She possesses a team-high total of 25 made three-pointers and is third in the conference in three-point percentage at 43.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB has successfully defended the perimeter as well. The Gauchos lead the Big West in opponent three-point percentage, holding teams to a 25.9 average.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos may meet their match Monday afternoon facing Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi as the Islanders’ defense is one of the best of their conference.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi ranks third in the Southland Conference in scoring defense, allowing 61.1 PPG. Most notably, the Islanders hold a conference-leading 29.6 opponent three-point percentage. They rank second in opponent field goal percentage too, restricting past teams to a 37.9 average.</p>\n<p>A pair of wins could send Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi into Southland Conference play with a winning record for just the third time in program history.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos will face more of a defensive battle in playing the Islanders, they will hope to contain North Dakota State’s junior guard Taylor Thunstedt.</p>\n<p>Thunstedt leads the Bison in scoring with 16 PPG which ranks third in the Summit League. She also leads the league in total made three-pointers with 42 and is fourth in points scored with 176 this season.</p>\n<p>Another concern for UCSB will be dealing with the size of senior forward Emily Spier. She’s behind Thunstedt in scoring with an average of 10. 3 points per game, but is the team’s leading rebounder, collecting eight per game, ranking third in the Summit League.</p>\n<p>Adding to the Bison’s presence on the boards is senior forward Brianna Jones. She is second on the team in rebounds at 7.4 per game. Freshman forward Reilly Jacobson follows with 5.4 rebound per contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi will tip-off at 2:30 p.m. Monday, Dec. 19. The Gauchos will close the Battle on the Border against North Dakota St. at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 20.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74608\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-19/non-conf-schedule-ending-gauchos-play-in-battle-on-the-border/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74608\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-19/non-conf-schedule-ending-gauchos-play-in-battle-on-the-border/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-19/non-conf-schedule-ending-gauchos-play-in-battle-on-the-border/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-19/non-conf-schedule-ending-gauchos-play-in-battle-on-the-border/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-19/non-conf-schedule-ending-gauchos-play-in-battle-on-the-border/","id":290,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[289,288,287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Reeling Gauchos Face-Off Against No. 2 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-12-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on No. 2 UCLA in search of a big upset win.

The Tar Heels won the match 84-67.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and UCLA will meet for the 20<sup>th</sup> time on Wednesday, with the Gauchos only having won one game against the Bruins which was back in 2003 in a one-point victory.</p>\n<p>If UCSB has any hope of pulling off quite possibly the biggest upset in program history, then priority number one would be to stop the Bruins freshman point guard Lonzo Ball.</p>\n<p>Ball has become a household name across the country within UCLA’s ten-game winning streak due mostly to his proficient passing ability. The Chino Hills, CA native is second in the NCAA in assists averaging 8.8 per game and has already notched four double-double performances.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 30<sup>th</sup> against UCR, a fellow Big West opponent, Ball dished out 13 assists, breaking the record for UCLA’s single-game freshman assists record. Ball also averages 15 points per game, fourth best on the team, and is shooting a great 56 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Fellow freshman forward T.J. Leaf has also been nothing short of spectacular. The California native has averaged 17.6 points per game, second-best on the team, and 9.6 rebounds per game, best on the squad.</p>\n<p>Senior guards Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton have also played spectacular with Hamilton leading the team in scoring with 17.7 points per game, and Alford scoring double figures in nine of the Bruins’ ten games this season.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Bruins have looked unstoppable offensively in most games they have played this season scoring at least 90 points in seven of its 10 games this season.</p>\n<p>As of December 10<sup>th</sup>, UCLA ranked first in the nation in assists per game (23.9), field goal percentage (56.2) and three-point field goal percentage (47.1). The Bruins also average 97.5 points per game, second-best in the country.</p>\n<p>Certainly, taking on this hot team at the Pauley Pavilion will be a tough challenge, but something most Gauchos is up to. UCSB is led by juniors Gabe Vincent and Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Both players had excellent games on Sunday against the Toreros, with Vincent scoring 20 points in the first half on 8-11 shooting. The guard would finish with a game-high 23 points on the night. Vincent averages a team-high 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Canty had a less than stellar first half scoring no points and only pulling down one rebound. The forward turned it around in the second half scoring 14 points shooting a perfect 6-6 from the field and pulling down three rebounds before fouling out.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to look to those two early and often if they want to come out with a win and will also need hearty performances from senior guard Eric Childress who leads the team in assists with 4.3 per game and has knocked down at least one three ball in six of the teams’ seven games.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night will not be an easy one for this struggling Santa Barbara squad. However, a solid performance on the road against such a quality opponent could be the thing the Gauchos need. Whether or not there will be an upset alert tonight, fans should expect a tough performance from a Gaucho team that, although has only one win, has played hard in every game.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against the No. 2 UCLA at 7:30 p.m. at the Pauley Pavilion on Wednesday, December 14 with the game being available to watch on the PAC-12 network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

He tallied five assists and two goals in November, finishing second behind Dortmund</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the Player of the Month voting, per </span><a href=\"http://bundesliga.com\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bundesliga.com</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with Forsberg, German striker Timo Werner is having a breakout season up top for Leipzig with eight goals in the opening 13 games. He will be hoping for a national team call-up in the upcoming months if his form keeps up. Anchoring the midfield is Naby Keïta, and the box-to-box Guinean has four goals in his first year after joining from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in the summer window.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact that the Austrian manager has on his teams is measurable, too.

Bundesliga on 64 points, with six points to spare on automatic promotion.

Since the parties went separate ways, Ingolstadt is in deep trouble, with just six points from their first 12 games. RB Leipzig, however, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> maiden Bundesliga season, are undefeated with nine wins and three draws, miraculously three points ahead of Munich at the top of the table.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile Arsenal, who have been in fine form early on in the Premier League season, are being forced to search for a Wenger replacement.

Indeed, a Cheyanne Wallace offensive rebound with 22 seconds left in the game turned into two made free throws for sophomore forward Wallace, which gave LMU a lead that it never again surrendered. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One contributing factor to the Lions’ high offensive rebound count was that the Gauchos played excellent defense in that fourth quarter. LMU shot only 26.7 percent from the field in the fourth, which of course created lots of opportunities for offensive rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB, on the other hand, shot a respectable 46.2 percent in the fourth quarter Friday night, but were unable to come up with a single offensive rebound. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortcomings on the glass, plus the Gauchos’ 0-0 night at the free throw line, was what made the difference in the fourth quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite 11 personal fouls, LMU managed to play efficient defense in preventing the Gauchos from reaching the bonus and getting to the free throw line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up 55-54 with only 32 seconds left, the Gauchos were in a position to make their struggles on the boards and in getting to the line irrelevant. All they had to do was hold onto the ball and milk the clock, and the Lions would have practically no time left to score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With several fouls to give, however, LMU was in a position to make milking the clock difficult for UCSB. Junior Lion guard Makenzie Cast did just that, fouling UCSB senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and coming up with a steal in quick succession. Wallace knocked down two free throws a few seconds later, and suddenly LMU had all the control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB sophomore guard Coco Miller played all but two minutes of Friday’s game and put up a truly utilitarian stat line of nine points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. Redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter and Jemerigbe led the Gauchos with 15 points each. Those were a particularly efficient 15 points for Jemerigbe, who played 24 minutes off the bench and went 7-8 from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up for UCSB is the last game of their four-game road trip. The Gauchos will take on San Diego State in San Diego on Sunday, Dec. 11 at 2 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74545\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74545\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-04/gauchos-stifled-at-lmu-drop-third-straight/","id":317,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[316,315,314],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season in Review: Women’s Volleyball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_012-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_012-web.jpg?resize=480%2C600&ssl=1","description":"In a season that started with a promising beginning but experienced its inconsistencies, the UCSB women's volleyball team still managed to avenge last year's losing finish.

They began a stretch of six wins in seven nights, their only loss at the hands of Long Beach State in a grueling five sets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exciting run gave the Gauchos a legitimate shot at the postseason, though it was squandered when a second matchup with UC Riverside ended exactly like the first, in a mystifying loss for UCSB. Riverside finished second to last in the conference with a 3-13 record, making the season crushing loss even more confusing for the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the wind taken out of their sails, the Gauchos were still presented with an opportunity to reclaim a spot in the NCAA postseason. A win against the nationally ranked Hawaii Rainbow Wahine would have given UCSB an inside track to the playoffs, but the Gauchos weren’t able to overcome the Big West Champions, dashing their postseason hopes once and for all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB concluded its season against UC Irvine, but the group appeared depleted from the two previous devastating losses, never showing much fight and getting swept by the Anteaters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the Gauchos will fall short of their preseason playoff goals, the plethora of young talent on this UCSB team is unmistakable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a big group of returners which is certainly exciting for this group,” Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, noted. “We have a group of young women that have high goals and aspirations for where they want to take this program.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First among those young women is redshirt first-year outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, who after putting up season averages of 4.09 kills per set, a .246 hitting percentage, 2.08 digs per set and 0.31 service aces per set, was named Big West Freshman of the Year. Ruddins also earned a spot on the All Big West First Team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She will play a pivotal role on the team moving forward, and the Gauchos will need Ruddins to build off her fantastic first year and continue developing into possibly the Big West’s most potent outside hitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lindsey was a big time point scorer for us this year,” Coach Lantagne Welch, said. “I can only see that [improving from here].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lantagne Welch continued, “[Lindsey] had one of her best matches at Hawaii against some of the top competition in the country. I know she can grow in certain areas, [such as] being really effective on back to back nights.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruddins success is exciting for the Gauchos’ future, as Coach Lantagne Welch explained how much room the redshirt first-year has to grow. “[Lindsey] has so much room to improve still. She started taking on a bigger roll passing towards the end of the year, and that’s something she’ll want to grow with and get better at, along with her defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside Ruddins on the Big West All-Freshman team was fellow Gaucho freshman middle blocker/right side hitter Rowan Ennis, who started all nine conference matches and finished the Big West schedule with 2.29 kills per set on a .253 hitting percentage. She, too, will play a vital role in the Gauchos’ offense moving forward after showing that she was more than prepared for the collegiate stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite another season ending injury, junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman still received an Honorable Mention for the All-Conference team, and for now, she’ll enter next season as the only senior on the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Elizabeth Sheffield also received an Honorable Mention for the All-Conference team, a heart-warming development for the middle blocker who spent her first two collegiate seasons with the UCSB club program before joining the team last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have many other cornerstones to build upon for 2017. Sophomore Emilia Petrachi was the most productive libero in the conference, and redshirt freshamn Hannah Juley proved herself as a permanent option at the setter position for UCSB for the next three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know our culture and team chemistry is excellent,” Lantagne Welch concluded. “We made a lot of strides in the right direction this year, and we gained a lot of experience. Now it’s just going to be using that experience to get better and grow as players.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end of the season begins the process for next year, as the Gauchos will look to build off their improvements this year to become one of the premier teams in the Big West in 2017.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/","id":5003,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5002,5001,5000],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Takes a Knee for Social Justice","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"More than half of the players on the UCSB women’s basketball team have taken to kneeling during the national anthem procession beginning at the team’s exhibition game versus Cal State Los Angeles ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74533\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74533\" data-attachment-id=\"74533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-01/womens-basketball-takes-a-knee/11-30-womensbball-scu-ericswensonnexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?fit=3771%2C2121&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3771,2121\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"11-30-womensbball-scu-ericswensonnexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74533\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11-30-WomensBball-SCU-EricSwensonNexus-1024x576.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"Many of the Gauchos women's Basketball team take a knee during the national anthem.

Specifically speaking, this was accomplished from a few certain swimmers.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013, former Gaucho Wade Allen broke the school record in the men’s 100 freestyle with a time of 0:43.26. Another UCSB swim alum, Andrea Ward, broke the women’s 200 butterfly record, a record which she previously owned herself, by a three-second difference of 1:56.11. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent graduate Katie Records also achieved three separate NCAA “B” standard times as a sophomore, with a 1:56.79 in the 200 butterfly, 2:13.64 in her preliminaries and a 2:13.52 in the finals. In 2014, while swimming her preliminaries, Records’ time of 2:01.34 earned her an NCAA “B” standard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placing third that year in her championship heat, Ward’s time of 1:57.18 in the women’s 200 butterfly also earned NCAA consideration. For the men’s, former Gaucho Mickey Mowry took seventh overall in the 200 butterfly championship final with a time of 1:45.30, acquiring himself an NCAA nod as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, the Texas Invitational has housed many of the Gauchos’ feats in swim. More broken records and NCAA time considerations will hopefully follow in this year’s competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Texas Invitational is an annually held tournament where only the best universities and their swimming programs compete. Over the years, it has transitioned back and forth from a Hall of Fame tournament to hosting for USA Swimming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previous A3 Performance Invitational opponent UCLA will also be present in Austin, Texas after placing first overall in the tournament last week. The point separation between the Bruins and Gauchos wasn’t too far off, so UCSB will look to close that competitive gap this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas Invitational rulings state that each school may only send a select amount of swimmers to represent them. Therefore, overall scoring will depend on individual results and placement times regarding each race type.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alumni had previously been present to race for UCSB.

Santa Clara dominated the Gauchos in both games, defeating UCSB by an average of 14.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Four of five starters returned for Santa Clara this season as the familiarity has been helpful with three Broncos currently averaged double-figures in scoring with roughly 12 PPG.</p>\n<p>Within this group of three are two of the team’s returning starters in senior forward Marie Bertholdt and junior forward Morgan McGwire. It was McGwire, who led the Broncos in each matchup, scoring with 13 points apiece.</p>\n<p>After redshirting last season, completing the trio of scorers, the newest addition to the lineup   is redshirt sophomore guard Emily Wolph. She is the Broncos’ markswoman from long range as she makes and attempts the most three-pointers per game on the team at 2.2 makes and 5.6 attempts, respectively. She is second on the team behind McGwire in three-point percentage at 39.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Still, the Broncos’ size is what poses the most difficult challenge for UCSB’s defense.</p>\n<p>In the first game, the Broncos managed to outrebound UCSB 45-31 in addition to outscoring them in points in the paint 28-14 and second chance points 24-7. Following this game just two weeks later, Santa Clara continued its dominance shooting 45. 1 percent from the field while outscoring UCSB in the paint 32-18.</p>\n<p>Given the Broncos’ ability to control the interior, it is obvious that the Gauchos will look to have a stern defensive presence in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to handle their size,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’re still small on the perimeter. I thought their size bothered us last year not just inside, [but also] on the perimeter [just as much]. If we’re not going to be as big, we have to be able to play fast.”</p>\n<p>While playing with at a fast pace may be most beneficial for UCSB, the Gauchos will hope to sustain their momentum from last game after tallying season-highs in field goal percentage at 46.2 percent from the field and 41.2 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s cold shooting in last season’s two games did not help their attempt to contain the Broncos’ size as UCSB shot below 30 percent from the field and beyond the three-point line in each game.</p>\n<p>Giving the Gauchos a better chance to compete against the Broncos’ inside presence is redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman. She enters Wednesday’s game leading the Big West in field goal percentage shooting 62.8 percent from the field and is one of two Gauchos, alongside sophomore guard Coco Miller, to average double-digit PPG at 12.2.</p>\n<p>At the brink of becoming another Gaucho to average double-figures in scoring is redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter. She averages 9.4 PPG and is third in the conference in total three-pointers made with 11. Porter’s 42.3 three-point average also ranks eighth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Put in the team’s starting lineup two games ago, Porter is still adjusting to her role after beginning the season on the bench as she emerges as one of the Gauchos’ top scorers.</p>\n<p>Yet, in order for UCSB to establish consistency on the offensive end, it must be efficient with possession of the ball. In its last matchup against the Broncos, UCSB had a season-high 31 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Despite being able to force Santa Clara to turn the ball over in the two games with 29 and 24 turnovers, respectively, UCSB was still outscored by the Broncos in points off turnovers each time.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get to a [point in which] we take more pride in our half court defense,” Henrickson said. “We have to be more disruptive. Even the little [guards] can be disruptive. We have to be able to get out and play fast in transition, try to take advantage of our speed. But to do that you’ve got to be able to get a stop.”</p>\n<p>With Edelman in the paint, it is plausible that the Gauchos’ ability to disrupt the Broncos increases as UCSB’s frontcourt has the ability to compete on the boards, which will help put the team’s up-tempo plan in motion.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s matchup between UCSB and Santa Clara will tip-off at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74522\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74522\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/","id":315,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[314,313,312],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Struggles Continue, Fall to 0-5 After 96-72 Loss at USC","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite having four players in double figures, UCSB could not stop USC's red-hot shooting and fall to 0-5 on the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a strong start by the UCSB men’s basketball team at USC, the Trojans went on a 30-13 scoring run in the final 8:05 of the second half destroying any chance the Gauchos had to pull off the upset and register their first win of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara returns from its three-game road trip 0-3 and sits at 0-5 to begin the 2016-17 campaign.

That didn’t change against the Gauchos as the home team was able to score a season-high 96 points in its rout.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_74470\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74470\" data-attachment-id=\"74470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-28/gauchos-struggles-continue-fall-to-0-5-after-96-72-loss-at-usc/gabe-vincent-drives-to-the-hoop-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent drives to the hoop.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite managing to hang around for most of the game with a solid 45 percent shooting from the field and having four players in double figures, UCSB had no chance of stopping a red-hot USC team who shot 54 percent from the field and was deadly from three knocking down 14 long balls, a season high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the Trojans were excellent with the three ball from the very beginning knocking down four of their first six attempts — two from junior standout guard Elijah Stewart — within the game’s first four minutes to take a commanding 14-6 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara answered throughout the majority of the match thanks to strong play from senior guard Eric Childress and junior guard Gabe Vincent. After a Vincent three, Childress matched him with one of his own to bring the score to 16-12 with 14:11 left in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next eight minutes consisted of back-and-forth baskets by both teams with USC’s lead never growing larger eight</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After a layup by junior forward Alex Hart, the Gauchos found themselves only down by two at 25-23 with 6:36 left in the first half. Hart finished with a season-high 14 points after shooting 7-14 from the field in, another season high, 26 minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once UCSB cut the lead to two, USC went on a 16-8 run to take a 10-point lead with just over a minute left to play in the first half. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright scored 10 of those points during the run and finished with a game-high 21. Santa Barbara managed to make it close before the half only going down 43-38.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB kept shooting well throughout the half, which led to them constantly cutting the lead, USC’s three-point range was so deadly that Santa Barbara could never tie the game let alone take the lead. In the first 20 minutes, the Trojans were 8-19 from three while the Gauchos were only 3-11.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the beginning of the second half came the resurgence of redshirt sophomore forward Ami Lakoju. The Harlem, N.Y. native only scored a total of nine points in his last three games, but scored six of his teams first 10 to spring the Gauchos early in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would cut the lead to four with a big tip-in at the 14:23 mark, making the score 51-47. Lakoju would finish with 12 points in the contest. After back-to-back Trojan three’s, Childress responded with his second of the match to keep the score within single digits. The senior finished the contest with six points and a season-high seven assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as the second half continued, the same thing that doomed the Gauchos in three of their first four losses came to fruition yet again at the Galen Center. After a UCSB lay-up making the score 66-59, the Trojans finished the game on a 30-13 scoring run making the final score a 96-72 rout. Stewart had eight of those final 30 points and finished the night scoring 18.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet again, the second half woes seem to continue hurting Santa Barbara, who, at times, just cannot seem to get out of its own way. Despite the loss, there were many positives such as a season-low nine turnovers, the resurgence of Hart and Lakoju and scoring 44 points in the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior forward Jalen Canty also finished with a monster game posting the second double-double of his career with a career-high 16 point and 10 rebound performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a 0-5 start is not ideal by any means, the Gauchos have the pieces in place to turn this season around as it is still very early, and with more and more contributions starting to come from younger players fitting into their roles, this could happen sooner rather than later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB resumes play against Sonoma St. at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 1 at the Thunderdome.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

After playing to a 13-13 tie, two kills from redshirt junior middle blocker Danielle Geiger and an attack error from UCSB freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen gave Irvine a 16-13 lead.</p>\n<p>Though the Gauchos continued to battle, that distance proved sufficient for the Anteaters, who held the lead for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>UCSB was again able to keep it close through the beginning of the second frame, though the train went off the rails a bit earlier for the Gauchos in this one. After achieving a seven-point tie, UCSB lost the lead, never to gain it again, falling 19-25 to the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>The third set was the Gauchos’ best showing, as if they’d realized the end of their season was staring them directly in the face.</p>\n<p>Playing with an increased sense of urgency, the Gauchos were able to extend their close play with UC Irvine far past their earlier watermarks, even taking a 20-19 lead into the final stretch of the set. Two kills from sophomore opposite hitter Harlee Kekauoha and one from freshman outside hitter Loryn Carter gave the Anteaters the lead, however, and the Gauchos were unable to get it back, losing 25-23.</p>\n<p>A disappointing season’s end for the Gauchos, the team’s inconsistencies mounted after having successive blows dealt to their postseason chances over the past two matches. Losing to UC Riverside put the Gauchos on the outside looking in, and last Saturday’s loss to Hawaii relieved UCSB of all playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield was the only Gaucho to top double-digit kills in the match, finishing with an even 10 in the final exhibition of her career. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins could only muster nine kills on 31 attempts, finishing with a .194 hitting percentage, far below her usual output.</p>\n<p>Sheffield’s fellow senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt finished with six kills on 11 attempts for the Gauchos, while Chloe Allen was able to add eight of her own. Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley finished with 30 assists, right in line with her conference average of 10.21 per set.</p>\n<p>Juley was outpaced by UC Irvine senior setter Shelley Anderson, however, who finished with 37 assists on the night while also contributing eight digs over the three sets.</p>\n<p>Two Anteaters finished with at least 10 kills; Loryn Carter collected 11 and redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis racked up 10 of her own. Four other players finished with at least five kills, contributing to the all-around approach that caused the Gaucho’s demise on the evening.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi was her usual self for the Gauchos, finishing with 13 digs (4.33 per set), far outdoing the Anteaters’ junior libero Luna Tsujimoto, who reached only six.</p>\n<p>Though this was not the way the Gauchos wanted to end the season, the year was beyond a doubt a productive one. UCSB was able to establish itself as an up-and-coming young team, with several of its best players returning next season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/","id":5002,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5001,5000,4999],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":64,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
