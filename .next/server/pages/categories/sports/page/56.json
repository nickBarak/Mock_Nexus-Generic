The Gauchos will look to continue the strong play versus a struggling Sonoma State side and a fluctuating UC Davis team.</p>\n<p>Sonoma State comes into this matchup with a 6-13 record but has won three of its last five games. UC Davis began the season 1-8 but has improved to 11-13 on the year after a 7-2 stretch in its last nine contests.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Sonoma State have only met once in the last three seasons. This will only be the Seawolves’ second game at home this season.</p>\n<p>Sonoma State has a great three-headed attack who each have over 29 goals this season. However, this season the Seawolves have conceded over 10 goals per game which may not bode well against a young, rising UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>After the game against the Seawolves, the Gauchos will travel to UC Davis to start Big West play against the Aggies on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Last season the Gauchos finished third in the conference with a 3-2 record but went on to claim their first-ever Big West Tournament Championship.</p>\n<p>UCSB faced UCD back in February at the Triton Invitational in a tight match. The Gauchos began to pull away in the fourth quarter, but the Aggies came back and cut the deficit to just one goal with a minute remaining, ultimately losing 8-7.</p>\n<p>That win for Santa Barbara made it six wins in their last eight games against Davis. However, the goal differential in the last eight meetings is just one. With that said, a close game should be expected between these two.</p>\n<p>The Aggies possess two lethal goal scorers in junior utility Paige Virgil and junior center Greta Kohlmoos, who have 46 and 49 goals, respectively. Virgil earned Big West Player of the Week three weeks ago, while Kohlmoos got it two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a lethal goal scorer of their own in senior utility Taylor Shore. The team captain is currently riding a three-game hat trick streak with 35 goals in 19 games this season.</p>\n<p>The Corona native will try to keep the hot streak going into conference action.</p>\n<p>Along with UC Irvine, UCSB boasts the best record in the conference at the moment but will have to beat some tough teams to stay there come the end of April.</p>\n<p>Every team in the Big West is ranked top-20 in the national rankings. Five teams hold spots in the top 15.</p>\n<p>Last season it was Long Beach State who was crowned Big West Regular Season Champions, but this year it looks like anyone has a real shot. Perhaps this will be the year the Gauchos win their first ever regular season title.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play at Sonoma State at 5:00 p.m on Thursday, March 9th at Dr. G. Edward Rudloff Pool. It opens Big West play at UC Davis at 11:00 a.m on Saturday at Hickey Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

She’s thrown a team-high 34 innings, starting in every one of her appearances this year.

USD will have already played Northern Colorado, UCSB’s final opponent for the weekend, earlier Sunday morning, giving the Gauchos an edge in terms of rested legs.</p>\n<p>The offense has been up and down for San Diego, though sophomores Taylor Spence (outfielder) and Lauren Kane (corner infielder) have supplied the team with consistent options atop the lineup.</p>\n<p>Spence is slashing .381/.447/.429, followed closely by Kane whose line stands at .375/.432/.525. The two have combined for nine RBI, six doubles, eight walks and 12 runs, and Kane has even gotten herself a triple in the season’s early going.</p>\n<p>Senior righty Megan Sabbatini leads the team with 47.2 innings pitched, more than double Lauren Berriatua (senior) who has the team’s second most. She’s been shaky in all those innings, however, racking up a 5.73 ERA, 3-6 record, allowing 10 home runs and a .333 opponent batting average.</p>\n<p>UCSB ends the Classic with a doubleheader against a less than formidable opponent in Northern Colorado, losers of three straight, on Monday, March 13, with the back-to-back games starting at 1 p.m. The Bears come into this matchup with only a 5-14 overall record thus far.</p>\n<p>The Bears again receive their main hitting contributions from the dynamic duo of senior Erica Dick (infielder) and sophomore Jordyn Wiatrack (catcher/infielder).</p>\n<p>Dick has slashed .333/.394/.550 with three homers, three other extra-base hits, and eight RBI, while Wiatrack has crushed four home runs of her own, a team high, and leads the squad with 12 RBI and 36 total bases.</p>\n<p>Senior Jayme Reddacliff is the only consistent option for the Bears on the mound, already having thrown for an eye-popping 63.1 innings on the season. Her 5.12 ERA and .306 opponent batting average are red flags, though, especially when juxtaposed with her 4-8 record. Northern Colorado figures to provide the Gauchos with an easier opponent to conclude their first weekend of home games in 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB showed a continued ability to win close games this past weekend with four of their wins coming by fewer than three runs. Though the strategy is not a statistically sustainable one, the grit of this Gaucho team does not go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer is up to four home runs, three doubles and 11 RBI on the season, and freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston are both up to two home runs and 11 and 7 RBI respectively. The power hitting is starting to come around for a Gaucho team that was in desperate need of deep ball hitters.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Veronika Gulvin was able to up her record to 6-4 over this past weekend and get her ERA below four (it now stands at 3.82).</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega (1-4, 7.81 ERA) is still a questionable option behind her, but Gulvin has begun to prove that she is the ace this team was pining for.</p>\n<p>After catching their first wave of consistent winning play this season in Utah last weekend, the Gauchos will try to continue the trend back in sunny Santa Barbara at their first hosted tournament of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts the Gaucho Classic I beginning at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 11, at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/","id":43,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[42,41,40],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Catch a Case of Southern Blues at Kentucky","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NicolasEitelbach_Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NicolasEitelbach_Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's road struggles continue to be an issue as the Gauchos were swept by Kentucky in their latest road stint.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the weekend, the Kentucky Wildcats (7-5) swept the Gauchos in a three-game set in Kentucky.

The score of game two would be 3-to-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the final game, the ‘Chos sent out junior RHP Steven Ledesma for his first ever career college start. The hometown kid from Ventura was pitching extremely well coming into this series in a long relief spot for UCSB. Down in the Deep South, the results would be different, though. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ledesma pitched one-and-two-thirds innings, giving up five earned runs off only two hits. After only giving up a home run to Wildcat first baseman Evan White in the first, the new starter struggled in the 2nd inning walking two, hitting one, and allowing a single that allowed two runs to score. Kevin Chandler came in for relief for Ledesma and gave up back-to-back singles allowing two more of Ledesma’s base runners to score. Even though Ledesma struggled in his first start, expect the righty to bounce back, whether starting again or back in his long relief role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With eight different Gaucho pitchers entering the game, Johnny Wholestaff would give up a total of 12 runs (nine earned) off 13 hits.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kentucky RHP Justin Lewis had a complete opposite outing than Ledesma. The Wildcat sophomore would throw seven perfect innings before giving up a home run to Austin Bush in the top of the eighth. With one swing of the bat, Bush would break up the perfect game, no-hitter, and shutout. In a game to forget for the Gauchos, the final score would be 12-1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After being swept, the Gauchos extend their losing streak to four games.  Now, the Gauchos look ahead to a three-game series this upcoming weekend to face the Brigham Young University Cougars (4-6). Here the ‘Chos will look to fire up their bats again in this streaky start to the 2017 season. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/","id":4143,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

The new pair was able to beat the Lobo pair of sophomore Ruth Copas and freshman Cassie Chung, 6-2. The pair was able to play well in an important set, which gave the Gauchos a good start and the important doubles point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting singles play for the Gauchos was Silveira, who bounced back in her individual play against her doubles competitor earlier in the meet, Dulski, by winning scores of 6-4 and 6-2. Gilbertson also bounced back like her doubles partner and won her match in singles play against New Mexico’s Chung, 6-1 and 6-3. The last Gaucho to pick up a victory in singles play was Atanasson, who was able to beat Olivier. The remaining three matches in singles play were left to be unfinished after sophomore Atanasson’s victory, and the Gauchos were able to earn the victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos went into this game coming off of a five-game road trip, which ended on a sour note. The team suffered two straight losses with one delivered by the University of Washington Huskies, ending in a straight sweep of the meet, 7-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Thankfully. UC Santa Barbara was able to bounce back extremely well in this match. Playing their first game back home since Feb. 12, the delayed start wasn’t the ideal situation for the Gauchos to earn the victory, but the team was able to settle into a rhythm that they were unable to in their previous match. The victory ended Santa Barbara’s two-game losing streak and the team was in control from the beginning to the end of the meet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the New Mexico Lobos, the loss to the Gauchos comes at a time where the team is struggling. The team is now 1-9, having not won a game at home or away. The team’s only win was at a neutral site against the University of Wisconsin Badgers on Feb. 18. Since then, the New Mexico Lobos have been on a four-game losing streak, and the team was once again unable to clinch the doubles point, something the team has failed to do in every game they have played this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara has a packed schedule this upcoming weekend, playing two games in two days.

CSUN operates a two-pronged attack, with sophomore outside hitter Dimitar Kalchev and junior opposite Arvis Greene accumulating the Lion’s share of the team’s kills.</p>\n<p>Kalchev, a 6’4” product of Kardzhali, Bulgaria, has also racked up 51 service aces so far this season. Not only is that tops on the team, it tops in the nation, seven aces ahead of second place Nicholas Szerszen of Ohio State.</p>\n<p>Almost every kill scored by Kalchev and Greene has come off of an assist from sophomore setter Sam Porter. Porter has piled up 669 assists over the course of the 2016-17 season, and he is fifth in the nation with 10.62 assists per set.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Matadors have been particularly effective on the attack, with the third-best hitting percentage in the country at .348. That sparkling is what enabled CSUN to crush Stanford and eke out a win over UCLA, and the Gauchos will have their work cut out for them trying to counter that accurate attack.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to find a way to bring the Matadors’ percentage down, however, if they want to stand a chance of picking up that all-important signature win.</p>\n<p>If that isn’t enough, they might have to do it without star redshirt senior outside hitter Jacob Delson, who missed both of last weekend’s games with an ankle injury and is considered questionable for Wednesday’s match.</p>\n<p>Delson, second in the NCAA with 4.43 kills per set, has been the key to the Gauchos attack all year long. His absence would be a major blow to UCSB’s chances on Wednesday, although the two games he missed over the weekend have provided the team with some time to adjust.</p>\n<p>While Delson is questionable for Wednesday’s match, it seems likely that he will be closer to probable for Saturday’s match against Lewis, currently the fifth-ranked team in the nation. The Gauchos will certainly need him against the Flyers, who have five wins over ranked teams.</p>\n<p>Lewis has a busy week ahead of them, even before they come to Santa Barbara. The Romeoville, Illinois-based team begins a three-game West Coast trip with a match against UCLA on Wednesday, followed by a match against USC on Thursday before taking on the Gauchos on Saturday.</p>\n<p>That’s three ranked teams in four days for the Flyers, and all are over 2,000 miles away from home. That might play right into the Gauchos’ hands, as they’ll host Lewis at the end of the grueling stretch.</p>\n<p>The Flyers may very well have one of the more balanced attacks that UCSB will see all year. Four different players have over 100 kills on the season, with opposite Mitch Perinar the leader in the clubhouse at 225 kills.</p>\n<p>Perinar and his three comrades (freshman Ryan Coenen, senior Jacob Schmiegelt, and freshman Kyle Bugee) have benefitted from the prowess of sophomore setter Matt Yoshimoto, who leads the team with 712 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s rough middle-of-the-season stretch has pushed the Gauchos down the rankings, but they have a chance to turn it around with two résumé-building wins this weekend. It won’t be easy, but then again, no résumé-builder ever is.</p>\n<p>The Matadors visit Santa Barbara at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, March 8th at Rob Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/no-15-ucsb-looks-for-signature-win-versus-no-11-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/no-15-ucsb-looks-for-signature-win-versus-no-11-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/no-15-ucsb-looks-for-signature-win-versus-no-11-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/no-15-ucsb-looks-for-signature-win-versus-no-11-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/no-15-ucsb-looks-for-signature-win-versus-no-11-csun/","id":4976,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4975,4974,4973],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Improve to 6-3, Split First Home Matches of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MTennis_AlexYam-DSC_3956-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MTennis_AlexYam-DSC_3956-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A return to Santa Barbara ended with the UCSB men's tennis team at 1-1 over the weekend.

The competition commenced with the doubles portion, per usual. This meant yet another dominant performance by the now-ranked 8th duo of junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays at a score of 6-3.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho sophomores Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm went on to ensure the doubles advantage point after a 6-3 performance of their own on court three. The Lions couldn’t even manage a doubles win of their own as they also dropped court two to junior Cody Rakela and freshman Kristian Prior, 5-4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The single portion of the meet just reasserted Santa Barbara’s dominance as a clean sweep of wins highlighted throughout. Moreno de Alboran handed back-to-back 6-0, whilst Rakela put up 6-1. Then was Holm’s 6-4 / 6-1 match, junior Chase Masciorini’s 6-3 and Freund’s, which actually went to three sets, 4-6 / 6-2 / 11-9. Mays managed to wrap up the rout of LMU with his 7-6 / 6-2 score, finalizing UCSB’s 7-0 victory on the day and marking a very successful start to their home campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was Gaucho tennis at its best on Saturday in front of a home crowd. Each player performed at peak performance in order to provide Santa Barbara with their third 7-0 sweep on the season. This momentum came deservedly so, considering Sunday’s meet would be up against a top-25 University of Oregon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, the Gauchos came off to a great start after earning the doubles point yet again. Mays and Freund put up an easy 6-1 victory on court one, whilst Holm and Prior also won on court three with a 6-3 score. However, court two went to Ducks sophomore Thomas Laurent and junior Cormac Clissold after a close 7-6 set. Nevertheless, the advantage point went to the in-form Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB went on to extend their lead after Mays put up a 7-5 / 6-1 victory for the first match. Oregon’s record-breaker Laurent claimed a 6-1 / 6-3 win over Moreno de Alboran, earning him his historic 16th singles win in a row. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ducks went on to tie the meet at 2-2 once junior Akihiro Tanaka beat Freund by a score of 6-2 / 7-6. Things didn’t get better for UCSB after Clissold scraped a three-set win over Holm, 6-4 / 2-6 / 6-4. However, Masciorini tied it up at 3-3 after a three-setter of his own, 6-3 / 3-6 / 6-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altogether, the meet decider depended on the final match between Oregon senior Jayson Amos and Santa Barbara’s Rakela. The streak of three-set nail biters continued as the match ended in a score of 7-5 / 1-6 / 7-5, unfortunately in favor of the visiting side, thus resulting in UCSB’s 3-4 loss on the day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altogether, another positive weekend is in the books as UCSB manages to start their home campaign 7-0 as well as showing that they can hang with the elite, nationally ranked tennis programs that come their way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos return to action this Thursday, at home, against the Baylor Bears at 1:30 p.m. They will then face off against New Mexico on Friday.        </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Azu-Irondi also picked up the meet record for his efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Kordell Hampton followed suit in the men’s discus, and broke Mike Wimmer’s 33-year-old record by an inch, launching his first toss of the event 178 feet, over eight feet farther than his previous personal best.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilmer’s mark was the joint-fourth-oldest record in program history. Just two weeks into the outdoor season, UCSB’s team is shaping up to become a force once Big West meets come around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really exciting. The first meet was a smaller practice meet, but this was our first chance to set precedent for rest of season. The team records that got broken were both over 30 years old which was amazing for the guys and everyone is just really happy for them,” junior distance runner Jenna Hinkle said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hinkle won the women’s 1500m in 4:28.20, just three seconds off her personal best in her first runout in the event this year, a good sign so early in the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The junior also finished first in the women’s 3000m in a personal record of 9:46.71, moving her to ninth in UCSB’s record books. She has now finished first in her last four races, including the mile and 3000m at the Gaucho Round-Up a week ago. </span></p>\n<p>“It was obviously a great opener for me, but it was my first 1500m of the year so it was a good gauge of what kind of shape I’m in at this point in the season,” Hinkle said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the trend of record-breaking season debuts, Adam Avila’s outdoor season start couldn’t have gone better, breaking a 15-year-old meet record in the men’s 3000m steeplechase in 9:00.20, which cracks him into the top-10 in the program’s all-time list to cap off the Gauchos’ historic performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the women’s sprints, the Gauchos dominated the field, with Morgan Simpson grabbing wins in the 200m and 400m with times of 25.80 and 56.91, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senior Shannon Trumbull grabbed a double of her own in the 100m hurdles and 400m hurdles 13.95 and 1:01.43, respectively, with a noticeable gap between her and the second-place runner in each event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Jazmin Moss did her usual thing in the women’s jumps, earning two first place finishes with marks of 17′ 11.75” in the long jump and 38′ 0.25” in the triple. On the men’s side of the jumps, junior Jeff Lam managed a more unorthodox double. Lam is victorious in the long jump at 23’2.5” and high jump at  6’4.75’; he is tied with sophomore teammate Joshua Rennick atop the podium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the men’s side of the jumps, junior Jeff Lam managed a more unorthodox double.

2010, 2012 and 2014, the San Francisco Giants celebrated three World Series championships. A baseball dynasty emerged in a historical 2010 season after having not won a World Series since 1954, back when the Giants were still located in New York.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Diehard fans were overjoyed to finally watch their team take home some long-awaited hardware. It was a thrilling and hopeful time for all Giants fans when they took another championship in 2012, and by San Francisco’s 2014 World Series triumph, the world of baseball started to acknowledge the bizarre pattern the Giants were somehow pulling off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco had a rough year in 2015, but the idea of the widely acclaimed “even-year” streak gave fans faith and high expectations for the following season. Seemingly, 2016 mirrored 2014. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Giants began the season with tremendous success, and then barely scraped by into the playoffs with a wild card berth. Other playoff teams and managers began to fear the strength and endurance of the Giants once they made it to the postseason, especially during an even year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The franchise went nuts with this as a marketing opportunity. Various signs, foam fingers, baseball hats, t-shirts, and chants were formed around this even-year idea along with the widely popular “Don’t Stop BeliEVEN” slogan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giants fans had to have known that it could only last so long when taking into account that there was no logical reasoning for how this “magic” was happening and why, but the phrases were catchy, the environment at AT&amp;T Park was unsurpassable and the belief of it all brought a great deal of optimism and playful banter among Giants fans and their rivals.</span></p>\n<p>2016 seemed like another ambitious year for the Giants to achieve the status of World Series champions, especially after making it through an embarrassing second half of the season.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dominant Madison Bumgarner at the mound made a return to the postseason after his historic 2014 run, and Conor Gillaspie, an unlikely postseason hero blasting a three-run jack in the 9th, powered the Giants past the New York Mets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mets were favored to take the wild card and advance to the NLDS, considering their ace Noah Syndergaard is some sort of mutant science experiment, given his hammer for an arm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Bumgarner was looking to master his craft once again as one of the greatest postseason pitchers, and the Giants overcame Syndergaard and his hammer, allowing the fans to continue believing in the streak. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After coming off a high from their wild card win, the Giants were confident and ready to face the Chicago Cubs, although they knew it would be a challenging feat. San Francisco had a long postseason ahead of them, while the Cubs had been crushing it all season long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicago led 2-0 in a five-game NLDS series when it came time for San Francisco to finally host Game 3. At this point, there was some uncertainty for the Giants, but they rallied when Gillaspie came through once again with a go-ahead triple off of Chapman in the 8th and Brandon Crawford added some cushion to create a 5-3 lead for the Giants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They lost their lead in the 9th when Kris Bryant tied the game 5-5, due to Sergio Romo’s unfortunate ability to give up runs. But, yet again, the Giants vociferously fought back in the bottom of the 13th, many thanks to Joe Panik’s double to drive in Crawford and make it 6-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giants fans were elated at the victory and the Cubs intimidating determination to end their 108-year World Series championship drought became less threatening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as obvious as it was throughout the second half of their 2016 season and postseason, San Francisco’s bullpen was not deep enough to carry them past the Cubs and on to another World Series championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The devastation of saying goodbye to the even-year voodoo was painful. The “BeliEVEN” cheers had died by the end of a disastrous Game 4, in which Matt Moore pitched beautifully until the Giants closers threw their 5-2 lead away by giving up four runs to the Cubs in the 9th.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some argue that manager Bruce Bochy should have never taken Moore out of the game, even though he was nearing a considerably high pitch count. But ultimately, it was a lack of skill in the Giants closers that cost the franchise and its fans another even-year celebration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As heartbreaking as the 2016 postseason was for the Giants and their fans, that even-year magic was sweet while it lasted. By defying the odds, it gave Giants fans something unbelievable to believe in. But of course, there is some hype to get an odd-year streak going, so maybe the magic is not quite dead yet after all.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/","id":1903,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[1902,1901,1900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Disappointing Campaign Ends With Highlight Win at Cal Poly, Send Childress Off With One Final Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-06-at-3.54.33-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-06-at-3.54.33-AM.png?resize=922%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Senior guard Eric Childress's 19-point, six assist performance helped give his team the win and ends his career as a Gaucho on a high note.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB men’s basketball team had a sweet finish to their 2016-17 season with a second win over Cal Poly, 57-44. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s season ends at 6-22 overall and 4-12 in conference play.

Powell brought in eight points in the first half as well as six rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Mustang roster, senior guard Ridge Shipley and sophomore guard Donovan Fields led Cal Poly, going eight and six respectively in the first period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shooting started off with a jump shot from Powell and a quick three-pointer in response from Fields. Both teams traded baskets consistently until the 12th minute when only four points were scored, one from Mustang junior guard Victor Joseph and the other from Gaucho junior forward J.D. Slajchert, until 7:40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The score was kept relatively close until the sixth minute when UCSB made a small charge to take the lead 23-18, thanks to a surge of energy from freshman guard Max Heidegger along with Powell. After a three-pointer from Shipley at 3:54, no further points were scored in the first period, putting the score at 27-23 Gauchos at the half. </span></p>\n<p>At no point did the Mustangs ever catch up to the Gauchos; the closest they came to closing the lead was right at the beginning of the second period with a jump shot one minute in from junior forward Luke Meikle, bringing the score to 27-25.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to score 30 in the second half, 12 of which came exclusively from Childress. Overall, Childress led the board with 19 points, the next closest scorers only bringing in 10 each. He had a great game with three steals and two assists.</span></p>\n<p>Junior forward Alex Hart only put four on the board tonight, a few less than he has been lately, but managed to snatch up 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to run away with the score, starting with a jump shot from freshman guard Christian Terrell. From 16:49 to 11:47, UCSB brought in 14 points while Cal Poly had seven missed shots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last five minutes of the game were characterized by a three-pointer and jump shot by Heidegger and four foul shots from Childress as well as a three-pointer from Victor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB came away with a 39.0 field goal percentage, well above Cal Poly’s 30.5. Santa Barbara had 45 rebounds and profited 13 points off of turnovers while the Mustangs had 36 rebounds and made six points off of turnovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 16 points from the Gaucho bench, 10 of which belonged to Heidegger, who continues to improve and play with fire and speed. In the last few games, the younger members of the team have truly grown, hopefully leading to a successful 2017-2018 season for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p>In the end, UCSB will only be losing one senior in Childress, but the guard will be a tough replacement to find, not just on the court, but off it.</p>\n<p>Childress ends his career with the third-most assist in UCSB history (407), and the second-most steals (153).</p>\n<p>The senior has been a consistent force for the Gauchos over the past four years, and he will always be known as one of the better players to represent the UCSB basketball program.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/thenexus_sports/status/838260790360588288</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/","id":514,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[513,512,511],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Clinches No. 4 Seed in Big West Tourney With Blue-Green Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-12.43.03-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-12.43.03-PM.png?resize=980%2C522&ssl=1","description":"For the second consecutive year, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the UCSB women's basketball team will be playing for the Big West title.

It’s all or nothing now, the momentum we have from this game will hopefully roll over to the next.”</p>\n<p>In one of the game’s most critical moments, it was Jemerigbe’s made three-pointer with nearly six minutes left in the game that prevented a surging Cal Poly team from possibly completing a comeback.</p>\n<p>Along with Jemerigbe, both senior forward Mi’Chael Wright and senior center Melissa Maragnes were celebrated for Senior Night.</p>\n<p>Shifting the game in Santa Barbara’s advantage were runs to close the first half and open the second before Cal Poly embarked on its fourth quarter comeback, cutting the Gauchos lead to six before coming up short.</p>\n<p>It was a highly energized atmosphere inside the Thunderdome with conference tournament seeding at stake. Nonetheless, both teams traded baskets in reflection of the game’s intense pace.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead which included a basket by junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, who scored a game-high 24 points but could never establish any consistency as she shot 9-of-22 and 4-of-10 from long range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck with a balanced attack, first going to redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman in the paint, then from behind the three-point line with redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter for a 5-4 lead. It was a start that led to a 15-3 run that before Lynn Leaupepe scored five-straight points to end the quarter as Cal Poly trailed 15-12.</p>\n<p>Porter continued to warm up from deep with two three-pointers in the first to minutes of the second quarter. The Gauchos’ shooter scored eight of the team’s first 10 points.</p>\n<p>It was Porter’s most productive period as she tallied 10 of her 13 points during the period, and ended the game 4-of-7 from the field and 3-of-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Yet, tying the game at 25 apiece with a three-pointer was junior guard/forward Mary Kate Evans for her only field goal off the bench.</p>\n<p>The tie wouldn’t last long once UCSB put together its 12-3 run before halftime. Half of the Gauchos points were scored at the free-throw line. Also responsible for half of the points lodged was Jemerigbe as her two made free-throws handed UCSB a 37-28 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>With momentum already going UCSB’s way, the opening minutes of the third quarter belonged solely to the Gauchos as they constructed a 16-6 run.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch began with the draining of a three-pointer by Jemerigbe to give UCSB its first double-figure lead of the game at 40-30.</p>\n<p>Helping Cal Poly chip at the Gauchos’ lead was senior forward Hannah Gilbert as she scored seven points and went a perfect 3-of-3 from the field in the quarter. Overall, Gilbert shot 50 percent (5-of-10) and ended the game with 12 points, four rebounds, one block, and one steal.</p>\n<p>But Santa Barbara’s scoring outburst proved to be too much as its bench emerged as well. The combination of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler’s drive and kick ability along with freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez’ perimeter shooting helped run up the score on UCSB’s end.</p>\n<p>The two scored six apiece, and it was Hernandez’ made three-pointer at the 4:17 mark of the third that gave UCSB a 53-34 lead as it seemed destined to route its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>Toler finished with 15 points and a game-high seven assists, while Hernandez ended with six points.</p>\n<p>Despite its 19-point deficit, Cal Poly still showed signs trying to curtail UCSB’s growing lead. Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe complemented her sister’s scoring with seven-straight points during the third quarter but it would not be enough still. Her final results to the game were 16 points and five rebounds while going 7-of-16, 2-of-4 from long distance.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to hold the sisters to inefficient shooting nights was key in its defense holding Cal Poly to percentages of 38.5 from the field and 35 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“We held them to 40, they had 55 last time. Good heavens they’re good. There’s not much you can do with a midrange game,” Henrickson explained. “We tried to keep them on one side of the floor. [On Friday] we played some things live, which we don’t normally a lot. Every assistant had a stat. What are their numbers, percentages, zone numbers? At the end of the day, the players have got to buy in. We [had] to play the percentages and we did.”</p>\n<p>Yet, a quick 8-1 run helped the Mustangs trim UCSB’s lead to 62-49 heading into the fourth. It set the stage for their dominant start to the game’s final 10 minutes as they then went on a 9-2 run, bringing its deficit to 64-58 with 6:08 remaining following steal and made layup by Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>With UCSB’s lead being jeaopardized, Jemerigbe prevailed with a three-pointer to give UCSB some comfort. Regaining the Gauchos’ double-figure lead of 69-58 was a made layup by Toler.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB scored one last field goal and scored the remainder of its points at the free-throw line where it finished 19-of-26.</p>\n<p>Ending the season at home and with a two-game winning streak is momentous for a Gaucho team preparing for March Madness beginning with the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Wednesday against the remaining highest seed at 8:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/","id":506,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[505,504,503],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Weekend Road Games, Remain Two Games Under .500","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-06-at-3.20.27-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-06-at-3.20.27-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos split their two road games at Penn State to stay two games under .500 on the season at 8-10.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Up until Friday’s game against Penn State, the non-conference play had been sort of a refuge for the UCSB men’s volleyball team.

The Nittany Lions never led by too much over the four sets, but UCSB simply lacked the firepower necessary to really take control.</p>\n<p>The second-set victory was a product of Gaucho defensive strength, as well as some major Penn State offensive struggles. The Nittany Lions hit at a -.077 clip in that set, which enabled UCSB to cruise to their one win of the night while racking up just nine kills.</p>\n<p>The other three sets lacked any decisive moments for either side. Penn State simply gradually pulled away from the Gauchos in sets one and three, while set four went all the way down to the wire before the Nittany Lions were able to put UCSB away.</p>\n<p>Freshman opposite hitter Spencer Fredrick stepped up for the Gauchos in Delson’s absence with a team-high 12 kills, as well as three blocks. Those 12 kills were a season high for Fredrick, who made the most of his Friday night opportunity.</p>\n<p>Compared to Friday night’s match, Saturday’s contest against Lees-McRae was in a whole other world when it came to the difficulty for UCSB. The Bobcats led for just seven of the 117 points played on Saturday and never challenged the Gauchos in the late stages of any of the three sets.</p>\n<p>The relatively light matchup allowed a wide variety of players to get some serious playing time. Freshman libero Grady Yould, redshirt freshmen opposite Kevin Fults and middle blocker Brandon Hopper and senior setter Grady Zant all played in every set, a major departure from the usual rotation.</p>\n<p>As evidenced by the final scores, the extra playing time didn’t overwhelm the new faces. Hopper was particularly effective in his expanded role, hitting .636 while posting eight kills, good for second on the team. His block on an attack from Bobcat senior middle blocker Rudy Klaas ended the third set and handed UCSB the match.</p>\n<p>Hopper was right behind Keenan Sanders in the kill category, as the freshman middle blocker posted a team-high 11 kills and hit .562. Sanders added five blocks and an ace to all those kills, giving him a well-rounded performance.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next match is at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, March 8th night against No. 12 Cal State Northridge at Rob Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

The Leopards came into this game with a 2-1 record on the weekend; however, that momentum quickly sank.</p>\n<p>This one was all UCSB from start to finish. The Gauchos scored their most goals in a game this season with 16 while also conceding their fewest amount in a game, giving up only one goal.</p>\n<p>30 seconds into the game, the Gauchos already scored with a goal from sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser. Shore added in two more goals after that before freshman attacker Natalie Selin wrapped up the first-quarter with a score, making it 4-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Sarah Snyder began the second-period scoring. 23 seconds later, sophomore attacker Guarina Garcia of La Verne scored its first and what would be its only goal of the contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB responded by going on an 11-0 scoring run for the remainder of the game. Snyder and freshman utility Abbey Grosse each scored to close out the first half. The lead for the Gauchos was 7-1 at the break.</p>\n<p>One minute into the third quarter, Shore scored again for her hat trick. Later in the quarter, after Kreiser scored her second of the game, Shore threw in her fourth as the Gauchos led 10-1 with more than a quarter left.</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Kate Pipkin and freshman center Samantha Rosenberg rounded out the third quarter scoring for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The final quarter had goals from senior attacker Brenna Thomas, freshman utility Kate Coski, senior utility Jenna Solberg and Rosenberg. The final score was 16-1, marking the Gauchos’ largest margin of victory this season.“Our counter attack was on, we were playing with great awareness and were just playing together,” said Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>“Our counter attack was on, we were playing with great awareness and were just playing together,” said Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>In its second and final game at the Claremont Convergence, UCSB went up against the host Pomona-Pitzer. These two sides met at the UCSB Winter Invitational when the Gauchos won by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The Sagehens entered this meeting having won four of their last five games after an eight-game losing streak to start the season.</p>\n<p>After a very quiet first quarter, the Gauchos led 1-0 with a goal from Kreiser. The second quarter was a completely different story, as UCSB went on a goal-scoring tear.</p>\n<p>Six Gaucho goals came in the second period of play while the Sagehens scored two over the eight minutes.</p>\n<p>Solberg and fellow senior, defender Sophie Trabucco each scored within the first two minutes of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Pomona-Pitzer answered with two quick goals of its own as they brought it to a one-goal game.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Coski scored for UCSB, and shortly after Shore extended the lead to 5-2.</p>\n<p>In the final 1:39 of the first half, the Gauchos poured it on with two goals from Solberg and one goal from Snyder to close the half with a commanding 7-2 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Sagehens cut the lead to three with 2:17 left in the third quarter, but the Gauchos ended the quarter with goals from Pipkin and Shore to restore the five-goal advantage at 9-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB conceded two goals and scored none in the final stanza as they clinched another victory.</p>\n<p>On Sunday UCSB played Cal State Bakersfield in its first game at Campus Pool in over a month.</p>\n<p>It was a shaky start for Santa Barbara, going down 1-0 from a nice backhanded finish from CSU Bakersfield. UCSB answered when Shore found Pipkin for the tap-in goal.</p>\n<p>The roadrunners took the lead again after that, but UCSB responded with a goal from Selin off a counter attack to conclude the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter the Gauchos took their first lead of the game with a nifty far-post lob shot from Pipkin.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunners tied it up shortly after off a well-executed power play from an exclusion.</p>\n<p>After that, UCSB turned it on with three unanswered goals in just over a minute of action from Kreiser, Shore and Solberg.</p>\n<p>In the second half, the Gauchos increased the unanswered goal streak to six when Snyder, Thomas and Shore added to the lead to make it 9-3 at the 5:19 mark in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>CSU Bakersfield ended the game on a 5-2 run and UCSB won in its home pool by the score of 11-8.</p>\n<p>Improving the defense was a big initiative coming into this weekend. The Gauchos only allowed five goals per game in the three games over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think we did a good job defensively,” Kay said. “It’s important now for us to start taking what we do defensively and fueling it into our offense and remembering to attack as the game goes on.”</p>\n<p>Taylor Shore contributed to another outstanding weekend with not only 10 total goals but also assists and steals.</p>\n<p>“I was super excited going into this weekend to get some solid games in,” Shore said. “As a senior I feel like it’s my duty to step up and take control.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos feel like they took another step forward with Big West play around the corner.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

you’re thinking about. The World Baseball Classic is here again, starting play on Monday, March 6. Now, I know what you may be thinking: “Who cares?” You probably have a couple good reasons to think that, too.</p>\n<p>After four world baseball classic tournaments, team USA has not even finished in the top three yet. This year, however, is different. Team USA is finally loaded, and they are trying to bring back gold for the first time in the tournament’s history.</p>\n<p>In case you may be unfamiliar with the history of the WBC and why the event came to be, here is some background. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee voted out baseball as an official Olympic sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because athletes still wanted to play and represent their home countries and their ancestral backgrounds, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association proposed an idea to the International Baseball Federation to somehow keep the Olympic-style play alive. The IBAF agreed and the World Baseball Classic was born. The first WBC would be held one year later in 2006.</p>\n<p>Modeled after the FIFA World Cup, the WBC features 16 teams that represent different countries. This year, Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, the U.S., and Venezuela are in the official tournament.</p>\n<p>Each year, however, more and more countries enter to play in the WBC. France, Panama, Brazil, Germany, New Zealand, the Philippines, Great Britain, Nicaragua, South Africa, the Czech Republic, Pakistan and Spain were represented as well. Although these countries did not qualify for the main tournament, they did play in the qualifying rounds trying to enter the WBC. I bet you didn’t know some of these countries played baseball, huh?</p>\n<p>The past winners of the WBC include only two countries: Japan (2006, 2009) and the Dominican Republic (2013). In these years, team USA did not have a roster that represented its full potential as a country.</p>\n<p>This was because the WBC title did not have much worth to players born and raised in the U.S. Instead, All-Star caliber Major League Ball Players would elect to stay in spring training to get ready for the regular 162-game season, which includes chasing the most important title of all: World Series Champion.</p>\n<p>Paired with this, there is a lot more opportunity to make money performing well in the MLB compared to playing well in the WBC.</p>\n<p>Still, this did not stop other All-Star Major Leaguers in the past from joining their respected countries. The Dominican Republic, Japan, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have all been represented by their best athletes every WBC due to one reason and one reason only: pride.</p>\n<p>Now, enter USA in the 2017 WBC. As reported by baseball beat writers and analysts, Americans are sick of being made fun of in their locker rooms for not having a WBC title yet; they are simply tired of being mocked for doing poorly in a tournament for a sport they themselves created.</p>\n<p>So what did they do? They got together the best damn team they could.</p>\n<p>Team USA is now the favorite to win the WBC because of the team’s ridiculously stacked roster. The position players representing the U.S. are Buster Posey, Jonathan Lucroy, A.J. Ellis, Nolan Arenado, Alex Bregman, Matt Carpenter, Brandon Crawford, Paul Goldschmidt, Eric Hosmer, Ian Kinsler, Daniel Murphy, Adam Jones, Andrew McCutchen, Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich.</p>\n<p>You may be thinking, where is Mike Trout? Where is Bryce Harper? Where is Corey Seager? Although these players and more were asked, they all declined for reasons stated above.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. will have the most powerful and skilled lineup the team has had in its history by far, and the most dangerous lineup in the tournament by a wide margin.</p>\n<p>Although they recently lost Cy Young winner Max Scherzer to a finger injury, the pitching staff includes other big names such as Chris Archer, Marcus Stroman, Michael Fulmer, Tanner Roark and Andrew Miller.</p>\n<p>The U.S. wants a piece of the WBC title pie. For the first time ever, they have a really good chance. With all this talent, will America’s golden boys pull through?</p>\n<p>In their first round pool (Pool C), team USA’s biggest threat will be the Dominican Republic, which is one of the few other teams that have a big-league roster. The U.S. should have no problems with the other two teams in their pool, Colombia, and Canada, but if the U.S. can beat out the Dominican Republic, then it should have a straight run for gold.</p>\n<p>Even though play will begin with a matchup between Israel and Korea at 1:30 a.m., team U.S.A. will not have its first game until March 10, at which they will take on Colombia in Miami.</p>\n<p>The final round of the WBC will take place in Southern California at Dodger Stadium from March 20-22. Do not miss the WBC. For the first time ever, team USA could be crowned the champion right here in our own backyard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76218\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76218\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/","id":1902,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It was a successful weekend for UCSB softball as the Gauchos won all five of their games at the St. George Red Desert Classic in Cedar City, Utah.

Sophomore pitcher Veronika Gulvin got the win for the Gauchos, thanks to a game-winning run in the eighth inning by freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz bringing in senior outfielder Kristen Clark.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76194\" style=\"width: 609px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76194\" data-attachment-id=\"76194\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/nexus-file-photo-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Nexus File Photo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76194\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=599%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76194\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>The game was scoreless until the top of the third, when senior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa singled into left field to get the Gauchos on the board with a run.

With the Mavericks only recording four hits throughout the game, UCSB capitalized by getting the run it needed to win in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Following Sunday’s game, the Gauchos are now 3-0 when playing in extra innings.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos got out to a sluggish start against Southern Utah, giving up three early runs in the top of the first inning. For Southern Utah, senior first baseman Karlee Manzione homered and brought three runs in, allowing her teammates senior infielder/outfielder Payton Hart and junior outfielder Sarah Murphy to score.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasn’t fazed, however, as they answered back in the bottom of the first, starting with sophomore second baseman Sierra Altmeyer’s homer, which brought junior outfielder Jessica Johnston in to score as well.</p>\n<p>Both teams were off to fast starts, and the game sat at 3-2 Thunderbirds following the first inning. The Gauchos went on in the bottom of the second to tie the game 3-3 with the help of a single by Hinojosa, bringing freshman infielder Kayla Krantz in to score a run.</p>\n<p>After some scoreless innings for both teams, the Gauchos secured a one-run lead in the fifth. At this point the Gauchos held all the momentum, keeping the Thunderbirds at bay thanks to junior pitcher Lena Mayer, who got her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>With a shot from Johnston, Hinojosa was brought in, securing the Gauchos’ 5-3 victory over the Thunderbirds. Johnston went 4-4 at the plate during this, including bringing in Clark for a run with a single up the middle.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Gauchos faced off against a Nevada team that would be shut out in five innings by Gulvin, who earned 10 strikeouts. After two innings, the teams were tied at 0-0, but in the third a wild pitch from Nevada saw UCSB senior third baseman Emily Brucelas score. Brucelas went on to bring in Altmeyer for a 2-0 lead. Soon after, freshman infielder Whitney Pemberton brought in Hinojosa with a single.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of fifth, Nevada still scoreless at this point, the Gauchos increased their lead to 5-0 with contributions from Diaz and Altmeyer off of a sacrifice fly from junior infielder Samantha Lujan and a single from Brucelas, who went a perfect 3-3 at bat.</p>\n<p>Nevada finally scored with an effort from junior outfielder Aaliyah Gibson, allowing senior outfielder Raquel Martinez to score the sole run for the Wolf Pack. Beating Nevada 5-1, the Gauchos built off of momentum from their two wins Friday.</p>\n<p>On Friday, UCSB looked to keep things rolling against Iowa State following the morning win against Utah Valley. The Gauchos got on the board early with the help of Pemberton’s solo homer in the top of the second inning. In the bottom of the third, the Cyclones tied up the game with a run from senior outfielder Cathlin Bingham.</p>\n<p>The next three innings saw the advancement of a 4-1 Gaucho lead, beginning with a run from Pemberton in the fourth. In the fifth, Pemberton’s fourth double of the day saw Johnston score to establish a 3-1 lead. The Gauchos continued with another run in the sixth, thanks to a sac fly by Clark’s, which brought freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez home to make the game 4-1.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, the game appeared to be coming to a close. However, the Cyclones rallied with the help of a single from sophomore catcher Kaylee Bosworth and a homer from freshman infielder Talyn Lewis. With the game now a close 4-3, freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega came up big for the Gauchos with a final strikeout for her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Friday, the Gauchos competed against a talented Utah Valley team, squeezing a 9-7 win over the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>Following the second inning, the Wolverines were up 4-0 after a four-run inning. Pemberton finally got the Gauchos on the board with a double in the fourth to bring Altmeyer home. Following two runs from Clark and freshman catcher Nyssa Williams, at a second at bat in the fourth Pemberton doubled to bring in Altmeyer and Johnston for a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines used some momentum to rally and score three runs in the bottom of the sixth, making the game 7-5. Down two runs in the seventh, UCSB needed to come up big to secure a win, and they did just that. Pemberton made her presence felt again, hitting a double to bring Johnston home to make the score 7-6.</p>\n<p>Following a Krantz strikeout and with two outs on the board, UCSB rallied to make the game 9-7 with hits from Lujan and Hinojosa, allowing Altmeyer, Brucelas and Pemberton to score at home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos not only came up big on offense in the seventh, but they also shut out Utah Valley in the final inning to win the high-scoring game 9-7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 9-10 thanks to their 5-0 sweep in Utah. They will look to continue that energy as they play host to teams in the Gaucho Classic, which will tip off Saturday, March 11 at 1:30 p.m. at Campus Diamond. The Gauchos will play Sacred Heart to open their weekend and will also face George Washington, San Diego and Northern Colorado twice over the course of the Classic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/","id":42,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[41,40,39],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prevail For 71-53 Victory In Return Home, Can Secure No. 4 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C636&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is in the position to lock up home court after its win over UC Irvine Thursday night.

In addition to its victory, UCSB is in this position thanks to the help of UC Riverside’s loss to UC Davis in its final game of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think for the seniors, it’s always about them,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “What you want is for them to have that chance. The pride that you finished in the top four in a really good league [is significant]. At least we have a chance to control [our path]. Everybody has something at stake; all the small things that give you a chance to be successful, we’ve positioned ourselves to at least give ourselves a chance. That doesn’t happen Saturday, that happens over the course of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Able to end a three-game slump in their return home, the Gauchos improved to 13-15 and 8-7 in the Big West. It was the opposite for UCI as it endured its third consecutive defeat in its final road game of the season, making the Anteaters 4-25, 2-13 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s plan to feed forward Drew Edelman the ball in the paint was evident from the game’s beginning as she finished the game one-point shy of tying her career-high with a game-high 21 points along with tallying a career-high 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCI] started with a smaller lineup. Since they didn’t start with their [usual lineup], it was a much easier target for the guards to hit,” Edelman said. “They were lobbing me perfect passes, so we connected well.</p>\n<p>UCSB outscored UC Irvine 24-6 in the paint and grabbed a total of 47 rebounds – its most in a conference game this season.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s dominance in the paint freed up space along the perimeter, allowing sophomore guard Coco Miller to emerge. Miller recorded 14 points as all four of her made field goals came from behind the three-point line where she shot 4-of-5.</p>\n<p>“[UCI] can’t stop everything. So if they stop the inside, [then] we have the open three,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Both Edelman and Miller ended the first half with a combined 23 points. The Gauchos’ frontcourt leader in Edelman scored the team’s first six points, which was the start to her 9-of-12 shooting night.</p>\n<p>Having entered the Thunderdome as the top three-point shooting team in the Big West, UC Irvine established its perimeter focus right away as half of its field goals in the first half (6-of-16) were made from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s first five shot attempts of the game came from long range. Knocking down the Anteaters’ first three-point attempt was sophomore guard Andee Ritter to give UCI a 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Able to increase her program single-season record of made three-pointers to 81 after Thursday night, Ritter had 16 points but was couldn’t establish a shooting rhythm as she finished 5-of-18 from the field and 2-of-9 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>It was an efficient shooting start for UCSB as it shot 50 percent from the field. But the Anteaters stuck around as the two teams exchanged scores to end the first tied at 17 apiece.</p>\n<p>The trading of baskets didn’t last long as the Gauchos opened the second quarter with a 15-0 run to take a 32-17 lead.</p>\n<p>Back-to-back three-pointers by Miller and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter triggered the string of points.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos’ dominance in the paint led to UCI getting into the foul bonus nearly halfway through the second. Making 10-of-12 free-throws in during the period, UCSB had one of its best free-throw shooting nights, finishing 17-of-21.</p>\n<p>It was not until the 4:50 mark that the Anteaters scored their first field goal as a result of a made three-pointer by senior guard Irene Chavez. She then hit another shot from long distance to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 33-23.</p>\n<p>Chavez tied Ritter’s team-high 16 points but was more efficient from behind the three-point line, where she scored all 5-of-11 of her field goals.</p>\n<p>Her two shots from long distance were the Anteaters only two baskets of the quarter as they were outscored 18-6 in the quarter and trailed 35-23 at the half.</p>\n<p>UCSB pieced together a 10-3 run to open the third quarter and earned its largest lead of 19-points after a made three-pointer by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe to increase the Gauchos’ lead to 45-26. Jemerigbe seven points, six rebounds, and a game-high seven assists.</p>\n<p>Each time it seemed like UC Irvine was ruled out, it was Chavez who emerged with pivotal scoring to keep the Anteaters in the game. With 4:10 remaining in the third, Chavez started and ended UCI’s 13-6 run with three-pointers to trim its deficit to 53-42.</p>\n<p>A made jump shot by senior forward Piper McKenzie and a pair of made free-throws by senior forward Brittany Glassow brought the Gauchos’ lead to single figures as Irvine trailed 53-46. Eventually, a set of made free-throws by Ritter made UCI’s comeback attempt more plausible as it trailed by five, 56-51 with 5:11 remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>But the Anteaters’ rally ended quickly once UCSB established its 15-2 run to close the game. While UCI struggled on offense with a 21.4 shooting percentage, the Gauchos prevailed from the field at 50 percent to lock up the win.</p>\n<p>After its win, only the task to win its next game lies ahead of UCSB. It will hope to secure the No. 4 seed on Saturday, March 4 against Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76185\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76185\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/","id":513,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[512,511,510],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":56,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
