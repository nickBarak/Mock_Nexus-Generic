He’s looked at some video and worked on some changes in his footwork, and it’s really paid off,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “He has great potential, and he is just scratching the surface of what he can become.”</p>\n<p>UCSB won the doubles point on Sunday for the first time in seven matches and will want to build on that victory against St. John’s. The new top doubles team made up of senior Ziad Sultan and Galskov won 8-7 while Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton won 8-6.</p>\n<p>“That was a much needed win,” Davis said. “Pacific was a team we beat at the Big West Championships last season and now they aren’t in our league, but we played well. I’m proud of our guys.”</p>\n<p>St. John’s (3-3) comes into Santa Barbara in the middle of its tour of matches on the West Coast. The team participated in the Pacific Coast Men’s Doubles Championship in La Jolla, California on Mar. 2.</p>\n<p>The Red Storm then defeated Rice on Monday, 4-3 on a win from Reyes at the top singles spot, 6-3, 6-0 over sophomore Tommy Bennett. Reyes has won four straight matches and is 2-0 since being moved up to number one singles. Also winning in singles on Monday were Del Nunzio, playing number two, defeating sophomore Adam Gustafsson 6-0, 6-4 and freshman Robert Livi who won 6-2, 6-1 over freshman David Warren from the number five position.</p>\n<p>“We played St. John’s last year and narrowly won 4-3. It’s a completely different lineup from last year though,” Davis said. “It’s fun. We get to host these teams here during their spring break, and we have almost no scouting report on them so we get to look at them on the fly and make adjustments without any prior knowledge.”</p>\n<p>After playing UCSB, St. John’s travels up the coast to play Cal Poly and Santa Clara before heading back to the East Coast. The Gauchos will continue their home stand this weekend with matches against Georgetown on Saturday and Radford on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/gauchos-host-red-storm-in-search-of-back-to-back-victories/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/gauchos-host-red-storm-in-search-of-back-to-back-victories/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/gauchos-host-red-storm-in-search-of-back-to-back-victories/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/gauchos-host-red-storm-in-search-of-back-to-back-victories/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/gauchos-host-red-storm-in-search-of-back-to-back-victories/","id":193,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[192,191,190],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 7 Gauchos Host No. 5 UCLA at Rob Gym","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mens-Volleyball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mens-Volleyball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces UCLA for a second time this season after the Bruins swept Santa Barbara earlier in January.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After splitting its matches last week, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team returns home from its two-week road series to take on No. 5 UCLA and UCSD.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter this week with an overall record of 10-5 and a conference record of 9-5.

In addition to winning the serve and pass battle, the Gauchos will need to enter the first set ready to play. Something the Gauchos have struggled with this season is finding their momentum too late into the game.</p>\n<p>“This week’s focus is just being ready to go from the start instead of waiting for a wakeup call,” Irons said.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the season when the Gauchos and Bruins faced off, UCSB’s senior outside hitter Matt Hanley led the team with nine kills. This game will be especially important for Hanley, not only because he used to be a member of the UCLA team, but also because it could be the last time he faces off against the Bruins in his college volleyball career.</p>\n<p>Hanley and the Gaucho offense will head into tonight’s game with momentum behind them. They are coming off a 3-0 sweep against. In that same game, Hanley had a career high night with 20 kills, hitting a .731 clip.</p>\n<p>Players to watch on UCLA are senior outside hitters Robart Page and Gonzalo Quiroga. Both players led the team in kills last time they played the Gauchos, and both players are leading the Bruins overall in kills for the season.</p>\n<p>UCLA will enter the match with an overall record of 13-5 (10-4 MPSF), and is currently ranked second in the MPSF standings.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match against UCLA is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start time in Rob Gym.

Junior pitcher Andrew Vasquez gave up a run in the first inning allowing a triple to the first hitter, followed by a sacrifice fly to advance the runner. However, that was the only damage done to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Vasquez, sophomore Robby Nesovic and junior Campbell Wear pitched the most innings for the Gauchos, going two innings each. The staff as a whole shutdown Waseda to allow only two hits on the day while striking out five.</p>\n<p>UCSB manufactured a run in the fourth inning on a two-out single by freshman catcher Dempsey Grover to tie the game at one apiece. That was the only blemish done to starting pitcher Yuhei Takanashi on the day as he exited after four innings of work that included five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Despite being held in check, UCSB had its opportunities on offense. After consecutive singles in the sixth inning, sophomore outfielder Dalton Kelly hit into a double play to end the scoring threat for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos put together another scoring chance in the following inning when a runner reached third base on a sac bunt with one out. However, Waseda punched out the runner on third on a fielder’s choice and UCSB went down quietly.</p>\n<p>Although managing 11 hits in the game, UCSB hitters did not bring another run home until the ninth inning. With one out in the inning, freshman designated hitter Josh Adams singled to right field, followed by a pinch hit single by senior infielder Joey Epperson to put runners on second and first base.</p>\n<p>After a strikeout, Kuresa delivered the game-winning hit to right center field to win the game for UCSB. It was Kuresa’s team-leading 12th RBI of the season.</p>\n<p>Grover had the best game by a Gaucho from the plate, going 3-4 with an RBI in his third game of the season. Junior outfielder Scott Quinlan was also productive, getting two hits in four at-bats.</p>\n<p>Waseda previously defeated the university of Southern California 3-1 on Monday in the midst of a Southern California international road trip. The team will next face UCLA today.</p>\n<p>This matchup against one of the best university baseball teams in Japan was a unique opportunity for the Gauchos to face some international competition. It is certainly always a special event when teams from different nations can come together to play and celebrate a national pastime.</p>\n<p>UCSB now goes on the road to Arizona University to play powerhouses Mississippi State and Arizona in a three-team tournament this weekend. UCSB will play both teams twice with its first game against the Bulldogs at 2 p.m on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 5, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/","id":4450,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4449,4448,4447],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Austin Kingi: A Gaucho Family Affair","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mens-Volleyball-7-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mens-Volleyball-7-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Austin Kingi has emerged as one of the Gauchos' most dangerous offensive weapons this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Described as being one of the more reserved players on the team, Austin Kingi is stepping up this season and gaining attention with his anything-but-quiet performance.

He began playing organized volleyball in the seventh grade, but has been exposed to it through his parents for as long as he can remember.</p>\n<p>This family’s involvement doesn’t stop there. The UCSB men’s volleyball team boasts not one, but two Kingi brothers who are currently in the starting lineup. Austin is one of the outside hitters on the team and his older brother Chad Kingi is a senior libero.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to compare because his position is more of the passing,” Kingi said. “But when I am playing with Chad, we definitely have some chemistry on the court.”</p>\n<p>Not only do the brothers play on the same team, but they also live together. One might think they would be sick of each other, but Austin said they have become a lot closer in this past year. Austin lists his older brother’s influence as one of the main reasons he decided to become a Gaucho in the first place.</p>\n<p>“A part of my decision to come to UCSB was because of Chad, and I had also grown up going to basketball tournaments on this campus so I was familiar with it,” Kingi said. “Another reason is because it was a UC school, and that was a better opportunity than Long Beach and University of Hawaii which were also recruiting me.”</p>\n<p>Austin said although he considered the other options, UCSB was always the right choice, and it was close enough to his family at home. In addition to having his brother on the court with him, he has a supportive fan base in the bleachers as well.</p>\n<p>“The whole Kingi family is very tight knit around their volleyball,” Austin’s roommate Lucas Steagall said. “It’s pretty cool actually, they are all very into the sport.”</p>\n<p>At just about any game, home or away, you can find the Kingi parents and grandparents decked out in Gaucho blue supporting their boys. Austin said that his grandparents love coming to the games so much they keep a second house in Thousand Oaks especially for volleyball season.</p>\n<p>“It has been really fun because my parents are able to see both of us, they don’t have to choose a team,” Kingi said. “My grandparents are also really supportive, they are at almost every game with my parents.”</p>\n<p>Other than following in his brother’s footsteps, Austin’s love for the beach made his decision to come to UCSB that much easier. When he isn’t busy with practice and school, he says kayaking is one of his favorite things to do. He also loves playing tennis and says that he recently started playing racquetball with his brother Chad.</p>\n<p>“I love tennis, I really just like to try everything,” Kingi said. “Chad just got me my own racquet, so we are going to go and play racquetball together sometime soon.”</p>\n<p>Kingi’s desire to try new things is directly related to his future career choice. He is currently majoring in Film and Media Studies and hopes to work on something involved in movie production later in life.</p>\n<p>“I want to experience as many things as I can. I am hoping to do some internships, and figure out what I like before working under someone,” Kingi said. “Once I get through some more classes I am sure I will have a better idea of the direction I want to go.”</p>\n<p>When asked if he had any interest in furthering his volleyball career, and possibly going overseas to play professionally, Kingi said he might consider it for the opportunity to travel.</p>\n<p>“I think about it, I would consider it for a few years to travel the world,” Kingi said. “But production is the end goal.”</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the rest of the season, Kingi has strong goals for both himself and for the team.</p>\n<p>“At the beginning of this season we all talked about how we want the national championship this year. I think this year especially since everyone is older it seems much more attainable,” said Kingi. “I have similar goals for myself, but I am just working to improve my role as a leader on the team, and leading by example.”</p>\n<p>With a tough game tonight against UCLA, Kingi’s role as a consistent offensive threat will be especially important. Kingi has already recorded 158 kills and 13 service aces in half a season. With plenty of games ahead, he is already approaching the 224 kills and 20 service aces that he earned in the entirety of the 2013 season.</p>\n<p>Austin Kingi is truly a product of his support system. Whether it is through his parents traveling to Palo Alto to cheer him on against Stanford, or his team looking to him in critical moments to lead by example, he is being surrounded by all angles and answering back with an incredible season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 5, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54357\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/austin-kingi-a-gaucho-family-affair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54357\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/austin-kingi-a-gaucho-family-affair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/austin-kingi-a-gaucho-family-affair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/austin-kingi-a-gaucho-family-affair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/austin-kingi-a-gaucho-family-affair/","id":5217,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5216,5215,5214],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Nevada, Defeat Former Big West Foe Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UCSB-tennis-vs-Nevada_02.25.2014-upload_Kenneth-Song-5017.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UCSB-tennis-vs-Nevada_02.25.2014-upload_Kenneth-Song-5017.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated Pacific this weekend, a team the Gauchos beat in last year's Big West Tournament championship match.

Senior Sasha Gryaznov also went three sets, but lost the match after going up a set, with the end score 5-7, 6-0, 6-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then hosted the Pacific Tigers yesterday afternoon. After a rain delay, UCSB started strong, winning the doubles point for the first time in seven matches. The new top doubles team made up of senior Ziad Sultan and Galskov won 8-7 against sophomores Daniel Alameh and Marlon Brand, while Teague Hamilton and Riminton defeated juniors Alex Hamilton and Erik Cederwall of Pacific 8-6.</p>\n<p>In singles, the Gauchos got some much needed wins from players who have not been on the best side of the score sheet lately. Galskov continued his run of great matches, defeating last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year Sem Verbeek 6-1, 6-4. Following him were Gryaznov who won in straight sets, 7-6, 6-2 over junior Denis Stolyarov, Hamilton who continued his hot play with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Pacific’s own Hamilton, and Seemann who defeated junior Ben Mirkin 6-3, 6-1].</p>\n<p>Freshman Erik Johnsson played what was possibly one of the longest matches of his life as he battled freshman Miguel Diaz for a victory, 7-5, 4-6, 12-10. His tenacity showed the effort the Gauchos have been putting into practice the last week to end their losing ways and they did that emphatically on Sunday afternoon. The loss puts Pacific’s record at 3-6 as the team heads back to Northern California.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their home stand with a match against St. John’s on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. and then weekend matches against Georgetown on Saturday, March 8 at 11:00 a.m. and Radford on Sunday, March 9 at 1:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Although she came in already down 4-2 on the scoreboard in the sixth inning, she was able to pick up her third win of the year with some clutch pitching as the team took the win 6-4. She pitched a 1-2-3 inning to close out the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara trailed early in this game and played from behind throughout the contest. In the top of the seventh inning, the team found itself down by two runs with very little time. The situation did not halt the team at all as it was able to score four runs in that half inning of play, thanks to a rally of four straight base hits and a sac-fly.</p>\n<p>Freshman outfielder Kristen Clark also came through at the plate all day, going 4-4 with one run.</p>\n<p>The second game for Santa Barbara was against Utah Valley (0-13).</p>\n<p>The Gauchos picked up their second win of the tournament against the winless team with the help of Collins once again. Collins picked up her fourth win, the second of the day, with a victory of 7-0 over the Wolverines. She allowed just one hit while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>The performances from the circle were surely the story of this matchup. Collins started it off by throwing three scoreless innings and junior Shelby Wisdom would come in to copy that same performance. Freshman Ashlee Ludlow entered in the last inning and recorded two strikeouts in her first NCAA appearance.

Santa Barbara was looking for a win in San Jose, which would have resulted in its first two-game win streak of the season. However, San Jose outlasted UCSB and dropped the Gauchos to a 2-8 record overall with a 1-1 conference record. Meanwhile with the victory, the Spartans boosted themselves to 5-8 overall.</p>\n<p>The day started well for the Gauchos, who split the singles matches 3-3. UCSB’s junior Stacy Yam defeated junior Julianna Bacelar of SJSU at the fourth spot 6-4, 6-2. Santa Barbara freshman Jaimee Gilbertson beat junior Jessica Willett of San Jose 6-3, 6-4 at the fifth spot and sophomore Luisa Ortiz Candido was victorious over freshman Tipper Truong 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>The match was to be decided by the doubles matches, a section where the Gauchos have been trying to improve significantly. San Jose outperformed the Gauchos, however, and drubbed UCSB in the doubles matches to gain the final point and consequently the victory over the Gauchos.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara dropped the first doubles match 8-6 as the duo of junior April Scatliffe/sophomore Priscila Garcia fell to the Spartans’ freshman Gaelle Rey/senior Sabastiani Leon Chao 8-6.

UCSB clinched the game with five runs in the seventh inning to win 11-0 after the game was called off one inning early.</p>\n<p>“We put some quality hits together and put on a hit parade,” junior infielder Woody Woodward said. “The coaches did their homework on the guys they were going to throw and we just went up there with a plan and stuck to it.”</p>\n<p>The first game of the doubleheader was a slugfest with weather conditions matching the play on the field. UCSB fell behind after a Princeton five-run inning in the top of the second inning, but scored four runs of its own in the bottom half to lead 6-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht was chased from the game after allowing runners to reach second and third base in the third inning; Hecht was charged with seven runs, five earned in 2.1 innings of work.</p>\n<p>The usually dependable UCSB bullpen did not fare better and tacked on four runs in the inning. However, the Gauchos broke the game open in the seventh inning, exploding for five runs to break a 10-10 tie. UCSB added on to the lead in the following inning to take the game 18-10.</p>\n<p>“We were sloppy in the field and I think we finally were able to get going,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “That was like a bad football game; our guys plugged away and we found a way to win ugly.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore Justin Jacome pitched one of his best games in the series opener on Friday. The lefty threw seven innings of shutout ball and struck out a career-high seven batters to pick up his first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Setting the tone early by striking out five of the first six hitters faced, Jacome took a no-hitter into the fifth inning before being broken up. Jacome faced the minimum in what was his second time in his career shutting out the opposing side as starting pitcher.</p>\n<p>“Our pitching staff is fantastic and we have all really good guys. There’s no drop off between the first, second and third guy,” Woodward said. “It’s a collective effort.”</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game open in the sixth inning after already leading by two runs. The Gauchos jumped on the new relief pitcher after two batters reached second and third base. A sacrifice fly, a wild pitch and a single turned into a three-run inning for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took advantage of a shaky Tiger bullpen and scored four runs in the eighth inning, capped off by a two-run homerun by senior third baseman Joey Epperson. UCSB took the game 9-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for Tuesday’s contest against Waseda University of Japan. First pitch is set for 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54309\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54309\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/","id":4438,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4437,4436,4435],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Finish Tournament With 3-1 Record","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB bounced back from a slow start to the season with a 3-1 record in the Cal Lutheran Tournament this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It has not been an easy start to the season for the No. 18 UCSB women’s water polo team, but after going 3-1 this past weekend in the Cal Lutheran Tournament, things are looking up.</p>\n<p>After a narrow 11-10 defeat to No. 16 Michigan, the Gauchos won each of their next three games over Fresno Pacific, Chapman and Villanova by double digits.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely getting better,” sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson said. “Right now our priority is defense.

Michigan went undefeated on the weekend, improving to 7-10 overall. Fresno Pacific went 2-2 and is now 5-10 on the year. Chapman is now 3-3 overall after going 1-2 in the tournament and Villanova finds itself at 3-11 after picking up its first win of the year.</p>\n<p>In their first match on Friday, the Gauchos took on the Wolverines looking to prove that they were a better team than their record might suggest. UCSB has struggled against the nation’s top teams so far this year, but it came out strong in this one with goals from junior utility Lauren Martin and sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson to take a 2-1 lead into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Both teams fired back and forth at each other, answering every run that was made. With the game close in the fourth quarter, goals by Martin, sophomore utility Jessie Porter and freshman attacker Carly Christian helped send the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>“Lauren did a really good job. She drew a lot of ejections for us and gave us a lot of 6-on-5 opportunities and penalty shots,” Hudson said of her teammate. “We just unfortunately couldn’t really convert, so that’s definitely a jumping off point the next couple weeks. We have a lot of time to work on our 6-on-5s because that’s kind of our weakness.”</p>\n<p>In the extra period, Porter was able to put away one more goal for the Gauchos, her third in the game. However, her team fell just short, giving up two overtime goals on its way to an 11-10 loss.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working on a lot of things that we need to do win games, like not letting other teams score out of two meters,” Hudson said. “We definitely struggled with that, but you live and you learn so hopefully that won’t happen again and we’ll get better.</p>\n<p>Going into its second game of the day against Fresno Pacific, UCSB came out on fire in the first half, scoring six goals in the second quarter to take an 8-1 lead. Thanks to their hot start, the Gauchos cruised to an easy 14-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Both Hudson and sophomore attacker Mackenzie Baber led the way offensively with three goals each while sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had nine saves.</p>\n<p>“We had a rough game against Michigan so I think that kind of sparked a fire under everyone,” Hudson said. “We wanted to prove that we were really better than all the other teams there so that definitely helped as a motivator.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB took on a Chapman team that had gotten off to a hot start to its season after allowing just two goals in its first two games. The Gauchos showed why they have one of the best teams in the nation though, as they completely dominated on their way to a 17-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Martin and freshman attacker Brenna Thomas each put away four goals to lead UCSB to its largest win of the season.</p>\n<p>Playing against a Villanova team off to a miserable start to the year, the Gauchos took advantage of the opportunity to get more of their players involved. Strong defense and a balanced offensive attack allowed UCSB to score a season-high 18 goals while giving up just five.</p>\n<p>No player scored more than two goals in this game and 12 players contributed at least one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have three weeks off before playing their next game at home against Harvard on March 22 at 12:00 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/","id":5093,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5092,5091,5090],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to UCD in Play for Kay Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WBasketball_Cameryn_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WBasketball_Cameryn_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB remains in eighth place in the Big West standings despite a loss to UC Davis on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Slow starts are very difficult to recover from in the game of basketball.

Offensively, UCSB failed to find an offensive rhythm against the Aggies’ zone defense, turning the ball over nine times and taking poor quality shots. In the first half, the Gauchos shot 39.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“They were changing up their defense. We haven’t seen a 3-2 [zone] yet this year,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We were trying different things, but we had a lot of unforced turnovers. We were just playing scared. We weren’t attacking like we normally do. We settled for jump shots. Our game is to attack and if we don’t attack, we struggle.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, Santa Barbara struggled to contain the bigger, stronger Davis team. The Aggies got into the lane with ease and each time UCSB did get the game into single digits, the team couldn’t earn the critical defensive stop.</p>\n<p>Davis shot 56 percent from the field in the first half and outscored UCSB 14-4 in the paint. On the game, the Aggies also outrebounded the Gauchos 41-34.</p>\n<p>“Some of them were just straight line drives,” Mitchell said. “When they’re a great three point shooting team, it stretches your man defense, and the so the weak-side help was slower getting there than it typically would be.”</p>\n<p>After going down by 13 just over five minutes into the game, the lead was extended to 18 points late in the first half.</p>\n<p>Opening the second half down by 14, the Gauchos played UC Davis virtually even at 26-24. In fact, Santa Barbara had the momentum with 7:28 remaining when UCSB completed a 7-2 run to bring the gap to 13 points, but approximately 10 seconds later, junior center Clair Watkins fouled out, sparking a 13-4 run for Davis.</p>\n<p>“The big run early set the tone,” Mitchell said. “We’d get [the lead] down to 10, 11 or 12 and couldn’t get it below double figures.”</p>\n<p>Watkins finished the afternoon with 11 points while Zornig led the team with 12 points and three assists on 5-10 shooting.

The Aggies rallied, trailing by as few as three points before UCSB regained command, taking a 32-23 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Big Al quickly picked up two fouls within the first two minutes of the second half, giving the junior center four in the game and forcing the Gauchos to turn elsewhere for offensive production.</p>\n<p>Following Big Al’s fourth foul, Bryson scored seven straight points for the Gauchos, giving the team an 18-point lead with 16:31 remaining in the game, its largest lead of the game. Davis would creep to as close as an eight-point deficit, but the Gauchos’ early second-half advantage proved to be insurmountable.</p>\n<p>Despite playing only 16 minutes, Big Al still managed to post a respectable eight-point, 10-rebound performance and now ranks second in the nation in rebounds per game. A pair of sophomore forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler were called upon to play more minutes with Big Al in foul trouble. Each played 17 minutes, with Brewe registering eight points and Beeler pulling down seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>Both proved valuable down low for the Gauchos, as the team controlled the glass with a 43-20 advantage in rebounds on the game.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon continued his stellar play with 11 points, six assists, four rebounds and only one turnover. Harmon ranks second in the nation in his assist to turnover ratio this season.</p>\n<p>Still, the star of the game was Bryson, with his 19 points and seven rebounds. He now ranks second on the team in scoring, right ahead of senior guard Kyle Boswell, who finished with six points on the night.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Corey Hawkins was the only Aggie to register double-digit scoring with 16 points. As a team, Davis shot 38.6 percent from the field compared to a 44.2 percent clip for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now sit in second place in the conference, one game behind Irvine and a game ahead of Long Beach State. With only two games remaining in the regular season, Santa Barbara needs Irvine to drop a game to force a tie for first place in the conference. Each team won on its own floor against each other this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces Hawaii on Thursday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/","id":548,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[547,546,545],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Weekend Matches on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-19VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-19VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB fell to UC Irvine before sweeping UC San Diego this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 5 UCSB men’s volleyball team split its matches this week with a loss against No. 8 UC Irvine Friday and a three-set sweep against UC San Diego Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos head into the second half of their season with an overall record of 10-5 and a conference record of 9-5.

Senior outside hitter Matt Hanley had a career-high night for the Gauchos, recording 20 kills at a .731 clip.</p>\n<p>“Hanley came out extremely focused,” Donahue said. “From the very first point it was obvious that he was ready to go.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came out strong in the first set, taking an early 7-1 lead against UCSD. They were able to maintain this performance for most of the game, but the Tritons came back in the third set and tied it at 13. After UCSD’s quick comeback, the Gauchos found their rhythm, going on a 12-5 point run to end the game.</p>\n<p>In addition to Hanley’s impressive night, several Gauchos contributed to the strong offensive performance against UCSD. Junior middle blocker Jake Staahl recorded nine kills and junior opposite Evan Licht had three service aces.</p>\n<p>After this weekend the Tritons now hold an overall record 1-16 and have yet to earn a win in conference play at 0-15 in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>A night earlier, the Gauchos did not have such an easy game against UC Irvine. After a slow start, falling behind in the first and second set, the Gauchos were unable to build the momentum they needed. The match ended in four sets, with the only Gaucho victory coming from a 26-24 win in the third set.</p>\n<p>“We just came out and tried to be as aggressive as we could in the third set,” Staahl said. “That is one of our biggest problems is to not get caught up with the game plan so much and just play aggressive volleyball.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was out-blocked by UC Irvine 11.5-9 and was held to a .059 hitting clip in the fourth set when the team needed its offensive strength the most. In addition, Santa Barbara’s strong consistent serving attack was nowhere to be found. The Gauchos were unable to get a single service ace in comparison with UCI’s four.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters advance to an overall record of 11-8 and a conference record of 8-7.</p>\n<p>The men’s volleyball team returns home this week with two games against UCLA and UCSD.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54301\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-splits-weekend-matches-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54301\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-splits-weekend-matches-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-splits-weekend-matches-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-splits-weekend-matches-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-splits-weekend-matches-on-the-road/","id":5291,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5290,5289,5288],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 18 UCSB to Compete in Final Preseason Tournament of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos travel to Thousand Oaks this weekend for a final tune up before conference play begins.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the beginning of Big West play still nearly a month away, the No. 18 UCSB women’s water polo team travels to Thousand Oaks for the Cal Lutheran Tournament this weekend in what will be its final preseason tournament of the year.

That’s the key because you don’t know what other players are thinking. We just need to be very verbal and tell each other what we’re doing on each play.”</p>\n<p>The Wolverines have gotten off to a disappointing start to the year themselves at 3-10, but, like UCSB, they have had an extremely difficult schedule thus far.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for Michigan is senior attacker Kelsey Nolan with a team-high 20 goals. The Gauchos will also be on the lookout for sophomore driver Presley Pender, who leads the Wolverines with 18 assists while also scoring 10 goals of her own.</p>\n<p>Chapman University comes in undefeated at 2-0 and has been impressive defensively giving up just one goal in each of its opening two games. Junior attacker Emily Holmquist has three goals and five assists to lead her team this early in the season.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, the focus offensively should be centered around sophomore utility Jessie Porter. Last weekend, Porter scored a season-high seven goals against No. 17 UC Davis, with three of them coming in the fourth quarter of what ended up being a close 11-9 victory.</p>\n<p>The remaining matches against Fresno Pacific and Villanova should prove to be favorable for a young UCSB team trying to find a rhythm.</p>\n<p>Fresno Pacific comes in with a 2-8 record. The Sunbirds have given up an average of 12.7 goals per game while only scoring 4.7 goals per game. In their only three matchups against ranked teams this year, they conceded an astounding 76 goals.</p>\n<p>In their final game of the weekend, the Gauchos will take on a Villanova team that has yet to win a game this season. At 0-8, the Wildcats enter this weekend’s tournament hungry for a victory after losing several close games last weekend.</p>\n<p>“Although they’re not ranked as high, we’re not going into it looking at it like that,” Martin said. “These are opportunities. We’re just going into it thinking that these are all games that we should win and we’re just going to have a mindset to win it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s first game against Michigan will be played on Friday at 10:30 a.m. in the Samuelson Aquatics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/","id":5092,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5091,5090,5089],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Irvine at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Anteaters come from behind to beat the Gauchos 77-74","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Camille Buckley was going to get her numbers for UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The senior guard that ranks second in the Big West in scoring and first in rebounding during conference play put up nearly identical numbers to the first time UCSB and Irvine played.

However, a 10-0 run by Irvine gave the Anteaters a lead they would never again concede. Six of Irvine’s 10 points in the game-changing run came from a pair of threes from Aguilar.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we let shooters get started. Definitely the difference in the game was Vanessa Aguilar,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Once those (threes) went down, we had our hands full because it gave them new life.”</p>\n<p>Down 73-68, Santa Barbara inbounded the ball to Jemerigbe, who dribbled right and found Zornig at the top of the key. She nailed the trey to bring the Gauchos within two with 41 seconds to go.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch drew it up during the timeout,” Zornig said. “We had [senior guard Nicole Nesbit] coming off the flare and she’s a shooter, so they put a lot of attention on her. I set the flare screen and just popped out.”</p>\n<p>However, Nesbit gambled on the inbounds pass, fouling senior guard Kelly Meggs and sending her to the free throw line, which expanded Irvine’s lead up to four.</p>\n<p>Nesbit made up for her mistake quickly, knocking down a clutch jumper on the right wing with 29 seconds left. Nevertheless, Buckley made her shots from the charity stripe on the other end to clinch the victory for the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>Irvine improves to 14-13 overall and 7-6 in the Big West while UCSB drops to 8-18 overall and 3-10 in conference. Since Riverside had a bye yesterday, the Gauchos keep a one-game lead for the eighth and final playoff spot.</p>\n<p>While a loss shows up in the record for Santa Barbara, the team looked much improved from past performances. Nesbit led the team with 20 points while Zornig finished just shy of a double-double with 16 points and nine rebounds. UCSB’s other starters pitched in as well with Jemerigbe adding 13 points and four assists and junior center Clair Watkins also coming so close to tallying the double-double with nine points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We are a team that I don’t want it to be an individual effort,” Mitchell said. “We have some very talented players, but it was the mistakes that cost us the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to play Saturday against UC Davis for its annual Play for Kay game. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/","id":547,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[546,545,544],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Face Stiff Competition in Louisville Slugger Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-04.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-04.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB enters another tournament with a 9-4 record and will face tough competition this weekend in Long Beach.

They have recorded a third of their wins in shut-out fashion and have allowed 3.5 runs per game. Performances from the team’s pitchers have been a crucial component.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for this substantial four-player pitching staff is junior Shelby Wisdom, whom has started in all eight of her appearances for the Gauchos. In her 55.2 innings pitched, she has allowed just 19 earned runs, giving her a team leading ERA of 2.39 and fueling this Gaucho defense. She is definitely a player that opposing teams will have to watch out for this weekend.</p>\n<p>The team’s offense has not slouched a bit with the additions of their freshmen players. Infielder Emily Brucelas and outfielder Stacy Cavazos have combined for five of the team’s eight home runs so far this season. Alongside them, outfielder Kristen Clark continues to succeed at the plate with her team leading .346 batting average. These young players have adapted to the NCAA level at a rapid pace to help this Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>This weekend, the team will face a variety of opponents in its five scheduled games. The Gauchos will play two games today against Nevada and Utah Valley. On Friday, they will have one matchup with Oregon State and they will wrap up the tournament on Saturday facing Louisville and Northwestern.</p>\n<p>The team’s first game today is set for 11:30 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris </em><em>of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-to-face-stiff-competition-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-to-face-stiff-competition-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-to-face-stiff-competition-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-to-face-stiff-competition-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-to-face-stiff-competition-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/","id":120,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[119,118,117],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":131,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
