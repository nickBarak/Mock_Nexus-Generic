Entering in ninth-place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with nine conference games left on the season, the Gauchos will have to come out victorious in a pair of must-win-games against No. 4 Stanford and No. 15 Pacific this weekend to keep its playoff hopes alive.</p>\n<p>“Every game is definitely a must-win from now on,” junior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “If we can get two wins per week it would be extra huge. We need to make sure we take care of business when the time comes.”</p>\n<p>After a dreadful road trip in which the Gauchos went 2-5, UCSB will finally play a home game for the first time in over a month when it faces Stanford Friday. At 7-12 record overall and 5-10 in conference, the Gauchos will this time have the advantage of playing at home where they are 5-4.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I feel like we’re going to be more comfortable, more confident, and just a little more relaxed out there at home,” Evans said. “They’re coming to our gym and they’re going to have to play their best to beat us.”</p>\n<p>However, Stanford (12-6 overall, 9-6 MPSF) stands in the way of UCSB’s postseason chances. In its previous meeting, the Cardinal swept the Gauchos with a big performance coming from junior outside hitter Brian Cook, who recorded 11 kills, six digs and four blocks. Junior outside hitter Steven Irvin is second on the team in kills (224) and will also be a threat on the left side.</p>\n<p>“They have the option of Brian Cook; he’s definitely a player they like to go to,” junior libero Chad Kingi said. “If we shut him and [Irvin] down, I think we’ll have a very good chance.”</p>\n<p>Pacific will present another threat to Santa Barbara Saturday. At 5-9 overall and 3-9 in league, the Tigers present a more favorable matchup for the Gauchos. However, Pacific defeated UCSB in five sets back in January, which at the time, extended UCSB’s season-long losing streak to six games.</p>\n<p>Although not as potent offensively, proven by their second to last place rank in kills and assists per set in the league, the Tigers’ bread and butter this season has been their defense, which ranks near the top of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I think in the past we really let other teams dictate what happens,” Kingi said. “We now realize we have to put pressure on other teams and make them actually beat us, and I think if we actually do that we will be in playoff contention.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will rely on senior middle blocker Dylan Davis who leads the team in blocks (95) and is second in kills (131).</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match versus Stanford is scheduled for 7 p.m. and Saturday’s game against Pacific will begin at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1659553196\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50579\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50572\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/local-organization-opposes-beach-revamp-asks-county-to-reevalute/mvolleyball-mark-brocherdsc_6265/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1360097226\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MVolleyball Mark BrocherDSC_6265\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50572\" alt=\"MVolleyball Mark BrocherDSC_6265\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MVolleyball-Mark-BrocherDSC_6265.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>MARK BROCHER / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>UCSB needs wins against both Stanford and Pacific to keep its playoff hopes alive.</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos head into the series after a successful weekend as they are winners of four straight. Texas welcomes Santa Barbara having just snapped a four game losing streak with a decisive 6-1 victory against Texas Pan-American.</p>\n<p>“The key [to the weekend] is just to get our young guys to go play the game of baseball and not play Texas,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We need to have the attitude of Texas is playing us and we are playing the game of baseball and that is really the message to our guys. The pitching mound is still going to be 60 feet, six inches and first base is still 90 feet away.”</p>\n<p>Texas at 7-5 so far this season got off to a great start. The Longhorns began the year at 6-1 and swept Nebraska at home before hitting the losing streak against the likes of Sam Houston State and Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Longhorns are led by preseason All-American junior pitcher Corey Knebel. Knebel was named to the second team as well as the Stopper of the Year watch list and Golden Spikes watch list. So far this year, the closer has recorded three saves in 11.1 innings pitched and is just 11 saves away from passing Houston Street as the schools all-time saves leader. Knebel headlines a bullpen that has kept the Longhorns a perfect 7-0 when leading through six innings.</p>\n<p>The 8-4 Gauchos, currently in fourth place in the Big West, look to take advantage of the strong Texas pitching by continuing their hot hitting. Over the four game winning streak, the Gauchos have outscored their opponents 24-7, and in the last four games have twice won in their last at bat. The success of the offense stems from the ability to get the lead-off runner on board.</p>\n<p>“We like to get guys moving and run. We sacrifice bunted a lot last year and haven’t as much this year,” Checketts said. “Our first order of priority is to steal and if you can’t run on the pitcher or catcher the second option is to hit and run. If the guys got really good stuff we will go to sac bunting because we like to keep guys moving and put pressure on people.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is hitting a solid .280 on the year. Sophomore utility man Woody Woodward leads the team with a .438 average and a stellar .561 on base percentage. Woodward and sophomore centerfielder and leadoff hitter Cameron Newell lead the team with 10 and 11 runs scored, respectively, and are driven in regularly by the heart of the order thanks to consistent hitting from junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>“I imagine if we think the pitcher is going to be on his game and that it will be tough to put up a couple runs we will be bunting and stealing more than usual,” Trinkwon said. “But if he is off his game you may see us swing away.”</p>\n<p>The weekend matchups and projected starters are sophomore Austin Pettibone at 5p.m. on Friday, freshman Justin Jacome at noon Saturday and sophomore Andrew Vasquez at 10 a.m. on Sunday at the University of Texas’ Disch-Falk Field.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/","id":4660,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4659,4658,4657],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Long Beach, Secures Fourth Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When it mattered most, the UCSB women’s basketball team came up with the victory.

We were very efficient in the stats that we know we have to be efficient in coming down the home stretch.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a shaky start, going down 17-10 as they struggled to handle LBSU’s trapping zone defense. However, with just under six minutes left in the half, UCSB found its stride, going on a 10-2 run that allowed the team to head into halftime down just four at 26-22.</p>\n<p>The momentum continued to sway Santa Barbara’s way to start the second half. A three from junior guard Melissa Zornig capped off a 13-3 run and gave UCSB a five point lead, which would never be relinquished.</p>\n<p>“In the first half, they changed defenses a lot, so we had to get used to it and in the second, we started to take it out faster and push the ball more,” junior guard Destini Mason said. “We got more stops on defense and once we got stops, we get out and run.”</p>\n<p>With a first round bye on the line and less than nine minutes remaining in the game, Long Beach made its final push, going on a 9-2 run spurred by the 49ers leading scorer and sophomore guard Alex Sanchez which narrowed UCSB’s lead to two at 42-40.</p>\n<p>However, that’s when senior center Kirsten Tilleman scored her first basket, sparking a 17-10 run to end the game. The Gauchos got out in transition, finding easy looks down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“When we can get stops and get out in transition, it makes us a lot better team, especially when they’re changing defenses,” Mitchell said. “It’s easier when you can push it and you don’t have to worry about what defense they’re in.”</p>\n<p>Per usual for UCSB, the team’s tenacious defense was a huge key to the victory, especially in the second half. The Gauchos held the 49ers to 26.1 percent shooting in the final period and with 10 steals on the afternoon, forced 15 Long Beach turnovers.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s solid second half defense led to a 37-point half as the team shot 50 percent from the field and tallied nine assists on its 13 field goals in the second half. Overall, UCSB shot 43.4 percent and recorded just nine turnovers.</p>\n<p>“We’re a defense first team and when we play good fundamental defense that we work on every day, that will lead to our offense,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I think once we focused and were in the right position at the right time, that’s what led to the run we made.”</p>\n<p>The offensive production came from a multitude of players as three Gauchos finished in double figures. Senior guard Angelei Aguirre tied her career-high with 13 points on 6-10 shooting while senior forward Sweets Underwood tallied her 12th double-double of the season with 12 points and 14 rebounds. Nesbit finished with 12 points, including 6-6 from the line, and a career-tying eight assists. Finally, both Mason and Zornig recorded nine points and Tilleman grabbed seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Players scored in a lot of different ways, whether it was at the free throw line with Nic and Sweets or Destini gave us the energy in transition,” Mitchell said. “It’s always critical that you have three players in double figures.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has now won two straight games and will look to continue its momentum Saturday in its final game of the regular season. Against UC Irvine, the Gauchos will also have a chance to win back-to-back games at home for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>While nothing will be on the line standings-wise, UCSB knows the importance of taking momentum into the Big West Tournament next week. Not to mention, the team would like to send seniors Aguirre, Tilleman and Underwood, who will all be honored before the game, out with a win in their final game in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a little bit of a roller coaster this year and if you go to the point we were at last year, we were losing by 30 points today at Pacific and then rebounded and beat Davis and never looked back,” Mitchell said. “To be at home, this is where we should be taking care of business. We have one more and I think our team has seen throughout the year the different [situations]. Against LMU, we put up 80 points and we’ve held great teams to 40 points, so we’ve seen everything, we know our abilities and we just have to take care of us at this point.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"320673017\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50578\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50573\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/local-organization-opposes-beach-revamp-asks-county-to-reevalute/womensbasketball_markbrocher_03-07-2013_dsc_1773/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1326585094\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50573\" alt=\"WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1773.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>MARK BROCHER / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Senior forward Sweets Underwood tallied her 12th double-double of the year in the 59-50  win yesterday.</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With senior night looming, UCSB has a chance to end the regular season with a winning streak before March Madness commences.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for us to build momentum going into the Big West Tournament,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “That’s what this weekend really provides, is an opportunity to hopefully get Nate back on the floor for senior night, to hopefully win two games and build momentum and have a three-game winning streak.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos must first face a dangerous Fullerton squad that has certainly given UCSB fits in the past. The Titans previously defeated UCSB 86-79 on their home floor to open conference play on Dec. 29 and were led by senior forward Sammy Yeager’s 30 points on 8-11 shooting from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have some big time scorers on their team,” Boswell said. “We know that their strength is to score the basketball, so … we’ve got to contest shots on the defensive end and we’ll have a good shot at winning.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton currently ranks first in the conference and eighth in the nation, averaging 78.4 points per game. Fullerton is capable of lighting up the scoreboard any night and features the second, third and eighth leading scorers in the conference in senior guards D.J. Seeley and Kwame Vaughn to compliment Yeager.</p>\n<p>“They’re one of the top teams in the nation in terms of scoring the basketball,” Boswell said. “If we can limit their shot attempts and good shots that they get, we’ll be in good shape.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has struggled with injuries for much of the season but is finally looking healthier with Boswell, sophomore center Alan Williams and junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle all returning from injury in the last few weeks. Guard Nate Garth, the team’s lone senior, returned to practice Tuesday and may return to the lineup in time for senior night Saturday.</p>\n<p>Big Al will be the focus for the Gauchos’ offense tonight as Fullerton possesses a lineup full of capable scoring guards but lacks depth in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to hurt them on the glass, hurt them inside, we need to make them pay for being undersized,” Coach Williams said. “We need to play to our advantage, which should be our strength and our size and how physical we should be inside.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1384689356\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50535\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50541\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-07/gauchos-battle-for-position-host-titans/magaligauthier_mbasketball_11112-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1351806281\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.001\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50541\" alt=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11-144x250.jpg?resize=144%2C250\" width=\"144\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?resize=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1 144w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">MAGALI GAUTHIER / DAILY NEXUS</span></h6>\n<h6>Senior guard Nate Garth missed eight games with a hamstring injury but returned to practice this week.

This weekend, the Gauchos will try to win back-to-back home games for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to realize that it is March and that there are no more opportunities to sit back and let things happen to us,” Tilleman said. “We have to be the initiators and realize that this is it.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met on Jan. 5, the score was tied at 44 with 1:41 to go. However, the Gauchos made crucial errors down the stretch and lost 52-45.</p>\n<p>“They changed defenses a lot and we had a lot of unforced turnovers,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We have to do a better job of executing no matter what defense they’re in.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers are led by a pair of sophomores in guard Alex Sanchez and center Devin Hudson. Sanchez leads her team with 10.8 points per game and ranks third in the Big West in three-point field goal percentage at 38.3 percent. Hudson averages 8.0 rebounds and leads LBSU in scoring during conference play with 10.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll continue to play man,” Mitchell said. “That’s our bread and butter. They have shooters … so we’ll stick with what we do best.”</p>\n<p>Defense is certainly what UCSB does best. On average, the Gauchos hold their opponents to just 53.3 points per game and 36.4 percent shooting. Defensively in the last game, the Gauchos sent the 49ers to the line 33 times. Long Beach took advantage, making 25 of those attempts.</p>\n<p>Having played the 49ers during the first weekend of conference play, UCSB is an extremely different team and know that like last year, March is the time to step up.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve matured a lot since then and have gotten more team chemistry,” Aguirre said.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"850112271\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50542\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50536\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-07/gauchos-battle-for-position-host-titans/wbasketball_markbrocher_02-21-2013_dsc_0423/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1325385890\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50536\" alt=\"WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WBasketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0423.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>MARK BROCHER / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Junior guard Nicole Nesbit registered a career-high 20 points in Saturday’s crucial victory over UC Riverside.</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Although this season will only feature 48 games, it is proving to be worth the 119 day wait. The Blackhawks have earned a point in 28 straight games dating back to last season, making them tied for the second longest streak in league history. The Los Angeles Kings are playing very well recently, and Coach Darryl Sutter will have his team ready to defend Lord Stanley’s Cup. On the other side of the country, the fans in Pittsburgh are ecstatic to have Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin healthy and playing together again. These exciting storylines and record setting performances are crucial for the league to retain its integrity after an ugly offseason. Here is a review of some of the hottest teams and best players so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chicago Blackhawks</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just when it looked like the Blackhawks were finally going to lose in regulation this season, Patrick Kane netted a goal with 2:02 left in the final period of last Sunday’s game against the Red Wings. Then, Kane carried his team to a victory in an overtime shootout when he beat Detroit’s goaltender Jimmy Howard with a multiple-deke move.</p>\n<p>Kane is leading the team in goals, assists and overall points with 11, 15 and 26, respectively. If the Blackhawks continue their dominance and Kane keeps up this type of performance, he will be a strong contender for MVP.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goaltender Corey Crawford leads the league in average goals allowed with a stingy 1.41 per game. The Blackhawks also boast the best goal differential in the league at +29 and have allowed the fewest goals overall (41). Chicago plays will round out this week with two games against the Avalanche and one against the Oilers on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anaheim Ducks</p>\n<p>After missing the playoffs last season, the Ducks have played much better hockey so far this season. They are second in the entire league with 33 points and are 7-2-1 in their last ten games.</p>\n<p>They do not have a dominant offensive scorer, but they can pass the puck. Six players have eleven or more assists, and ten players have five or more goals. Captain Ryan Getzlaf leads the team in goals(8), assists(17), and overall points(25).</p>\n<p>As for the men tending the goal, Viktor Fasth is 9-1 with an average of 2.08 goals allowed per game. Also, veteran Jonas Hiller is averaging a surprisingly high 3.24 goals allowed per game. The Ducks have lost consecutive games to the Coyotes, 5-4 in shootouts. Their next three games will be at home against the Coyotes, Flames and Blues.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p>The defending Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings got off to a rough 3-7 start this season. However, Anze Kopitar and the rest of the Kings have won eight of their last ten games.</p>\n<p>Kopitar leads the team in points with 18, while fellow center Jeff Carter is first on the team and tied for second in the league with 14 goals. In the Kings 5-1 win over the Predators on Monday, Carter completed his fifth career hat trick with two goals within a 19 second span in the final period.</p>\n<p>After putting together one of the greatest post season performances ever last season, goaltender Jonathan Quick has struggled this season. He is a meager 6-6 this season and is allowing an average of 2.54 goals per game. Recently the Kings have been mixing in Jonathan Bernier between the pipes. Bernier is 5-1 this season as the goaltender and is allowing an average of 1.53 goals per game. The Kings have three more games on this homestand and then travel to play the Coyotes and Sharks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the Penguins have their superstars healthy and scoring the puck. As a team, they are second in the Eastern Conference and lead the league in average goals per game with 3.48.</p>\n<p>Sidney Crosby is leading the league in points with 36, and assists with 25. Right behind him is the Penguins left wing Chris Kunitz, who is second in the league with 28 points and first in plus-minus with 17. In addition to Kunitz and Crosby, they have seven other players with ten or more points this season. Left wing James Neal is tied for second in the league with 14 goals and Malkin is tied for fourth in the league with 18 assists.</p>\n<p>Their goaltender, Marc-Andre Fleury, is tied for the lead league in wins with 11 and is allowing an average of 2.44 goals per game. The Penguins are 7-3 in their last ten games and if their defense improves they will be a tough out in the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Montreal Canadiens</p>\n<p>The Canadiens are in first place in the Eastern Conference with 32 points. They are 7-3 in their last ten games and are allowing the fifth least amount of goals per game with 2.32.</p>\n<p>Goaltender Carey Price is tied for second in the league with 11 wins and tied for second in shutouts with two. After finishing in 28th place last season, the Canadiens have turned the page and are firing on all cylinders. In their game against the fourth place Bruins on Sunday, Montreal took advantage of the penalty on Boston’s key defender, Zdeno Chara, to take the lead for good in the third period.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ice, the Canadiens are led by left wing Max Pacioretty, and centers David Desharnais and Tomas Plekanec. They have combined for a total of 49 points this season and are distributing the puck nicely. After yesterday’s game against the Islanders, Montreal will travel to the Hurricanes, Lightning and Panthers this week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Leaders (as of March 4)</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<p>17 – Steven Stamkos, Center, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>14 – James Neal, Left Wing, Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>14 – Jeff Carter, Center, Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assists:</p>\n<p>25 – Sidney Crosby, Center, Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>23 – Martin St. Louis, Right Wing, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>19 – Henrik Zetterberg, Left Wing, Detroit Red Wings</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Points:</p>\n<p>36 – Sidney Crosby, Center Pittsburg Penguins</p>\n<p>34 – Steven Stamkos, Center, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>28 – Chris Kunitz, Left Wing, Pittsburg Penguins</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Artwork by Anna Xu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50513\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50513\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/","id":2115,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[2114,2113,2112],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Crunch Time in the NBA: the Playoff Picture","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The NBA season is almost three-quarters the way through.

And despite how difficult it is to win back-to-back MVP awards, LeBron James is the best option for the award at the moment after becoming the first player to go six games averaging 30 or more points while shooting over 50 percent from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A little further down in the standings is Chicago. Derrick Rose has yet to play this season after tearing his ACL in the playoffs last year. When he will return remains a mystery, but against the Pacers three days ago, Rose returned to the bench, giving his team hope. Without Rose, I don’t see the Bulls going too far into the playoffs, although they have raised some eyebrows this year, currently in fourth place without their leader.</p>\n<p>Not to say that the squad isn’t still extremely talented with players like Joakim Noah and Luol Deng. My worry with Rose is that he could come back too early. There’s been a lot of pressure for him to return and knees can be extremely vulnerable after serious injuries like an ACL tear. If it were me, I’d take my time coming back.</p>\n<p>If there’s one team that I think will contend with Miami, it will be Indiana. The Heat isn’t a big team, preferring to play with a small lineup and put James at the power forward and has struggled when other teams pound the ball inside.</p>\n<p>Last year, Indiana and the Heat matched up in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Miami took the series 4-2, but it didn’t come with ease. This season Indiana is an undefeated 2-0 against the defending champs and both victories have come by at least 10 points.</p>\n<p>Paul George is having a stellar year, averaging 17.6 points and nearly eight rebounds per contest. Yet, the Pacers have plenty of great players around him with David West, George Hill and Roy Hibbert all averaging double digit scoring. With Danny Granger coming back from injury, I’d expect to see Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>\n<p>In the Western Conference, San Antonio currently has the best record in the NBA at 47-14, but it will be interesting to see how the Spurs do down the stretch. The team just lost Tony Parker, who certainly was a candidate for MVP, due to an ankle sprain and will be out for four weeks. Parker was having arguably the best season of his career, averaging 26.1 points, 8.3 assists and four rebounds per game. He was also shooting about 54 percent from the field. The team will need its veterans like Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan to step up.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Spurs were the leading team in the west going into playoffs as well, but were beaten by Oklahoma City in the Western Conference Finals. Personally, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the same happen again this year. San Antonio is full of veterans that know how to win, but the athleticism and young talent of OKC will be too much to handle for the Spurs.</p>\n<p>Finally, fighting for a playoff spot in the west has been Houston. They’ve currently taken the seventh spot in conference, primarily due to the outstanding play of James Harden. The ex-Thunder player now has the spotlight on him. There’s no Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook to overshadow him and Harden has delivered.</p>\n<p>While I thought he might struggle due to the fact that opponents could key in on him, Harden has stepped up his game. He’s averaging 26.2 points per game compared to 16.8 points per game last season. He’s also dishing 5.7 assists per game, over two more than last year. Houston might not be a contender for a title, but Harden had certainly solidified himself as one of the great scorers in the game today.</p>\n<p>With a full season this year, injuries will certainly come into play as many teams start to get worn down from the taxing schedule. My prediction is that there will be a rematch of last year’s NBA finals with Miami taking on OKC. That wouldn’t be too bad as fans would once again be treated to two of the best players in the game going head to head.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/","id":652,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[651,650,649],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Johnson Making Impact with Indiana","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"At this time last season, Orlando Johnson was the best player for the UCSB men’s basketball team and a hopeful candidate for the NBA draft.

While playing time was slow for Johnson in the beginning of the season, he improved his game by playing for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA D-League.</p>\n<p>Soon after he received a shot at playing time, Johnson earned a spot in the rotation thanks to his excellent three-point shooting. Johnson currently leads the Pacers from behind the arc, shooting .500 on the season, a team high.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very good three-point shooter, but he also was swarmed all the time, double-teamed and guarded and he was the focus every game we went into,” Williams said. “Now he’s getting to play on a team that has all-stars on it and a lot of other really good players and he’s a role player that gets to come in. He’s always had great range on his shot.”</p>\n<p>Johnson left UCSB as the school’s all-time leading scorer in just three seasons of play, so it comes as no surprise to Gauchos to see Johnson score. He emerged in Indiana’s rotation in large part to an injury to Danny Granger, eclipsing veterans Gerald Green and Sam Young for time.</p>\n<p>The fact that he is also contributing on a team that is in playoff contention only makes Johnson’s emergence in the NBA that much more impressive. Indiana currently holds a 38-22 record, second best in the Eastern Conference behind only defending champion Miami.</p>\n<p>During the month of February, Johnson averaged 4.6 points and 2.2 rebounds per game while shooting .531 from behind the arc. On Feb. 22, he registered a career-high 14 points and 23 minutes of playing time in a 114-82 victory over the Pistons. Johnson was a perfect 5-5 from the field, including 3-3 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“Nobody will work harder at their game; nobody will work harder at the trade than Orlando,” Williams said. “He’s not physically going to get a lot better; he’s a big strong man already. Where he’s going to get a lot better is the concepts of the NBA game, how they play it. If that happens, he’s going to get a lot more valuable. I think he’ll always be a role player in the NBA. That’s really valuable and that’s really good if you can be an NBA role player.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50517\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50517\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/","id":647,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[646,645,644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Fourth Straight in Rout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/UCSB-Baseball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/UCSB-Baseball.jpg?resize=520%2C347&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team capped its long nine-game homestand on Monday with a blowout win over Saint Mary’s College by a score of 10-1.

Chapman pitched six strong innings for his second win of the year, allowing just three hits and just one run coming in the first inning.</p>\n<p>“Early on I felt kind of off, just a little bit,” Chapman said. “I had a tough time getting the first pitch strike over but after that first inning I found myself a little bit and was getting that first pitch strike over and felt that after that my change up was working for me better and had real great defense behind me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gaels jumped out to a lead in the first inning on an RBI single by sophomore Collin Ferguson. Chapman had walked the leadoff hitter who then stole second to move into scoring position. Ferguson sent a 0-2 pitch into right field to put his team on the board first.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tied the game in the bottom of the second inning after getting their own leadoff hitter aboard. Sophomore right fielder Luke Swenson singled to shortstop and advanced to second base on a wild pitch. Freshman center fielder Andrew Calica then doubled in Swenson to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Kelsey Outram had gotten through four innings relatively unscathed for the Gaels but was hurt by allowing the leadoff man aboard. In the bottom of the fifth inning, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon singled to start the inning followed by sophomore Tyler Kuresa. The two then advanced on a sacrifice bunt and came around to score on Swenson’s two-run double. Swenson would come around to score on a squeeze by freshman second baseman Ryan Clark for the three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put another three-spot on Saint Mary’s when yet again the leadoff batter reached base. With the bases loaded and one out, Kuresa crushed a double to right center field to clear the bases and put the Gauchos up 7-1.</p>\n<p>“It was a great day today. Everyone was on,” Trinkwon said. “We got 12 hits, probably should have had even more; I know I let a couple opportunities slip away, I know some other guys did too but we are satisfied with the win.”</p>\n<p>Chapman led the top of the seventh off with a walk and was pulled in favor of freshman Domenic Mazza, who recorded three quick outs to keep the Gaels off the board in the seventh. Fellow relievers, freshman Connor Baits and senior Jared Wilson, followed suit with quick eighth and ninth innings to seal the victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a good bounce back for [Chapman and Mazza]. They came in throwing strikes. [Chapman] did a nice job, but … we have seen better so I think there is still one more gear for him to get into,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “And that was the Dom we know and love and the guy we thought we had.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara next faces the University of Texas this weekend.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 5th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50469\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50469\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/","id":4506,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4505,4504,4503],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Get Revenge Against Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0565.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0565.jpg?resize=400%2C599&ssl=1","description":"After a horrible loss to Cal State Fullerton Thursday that broke a 40-game winning streak, the UCSB women’s basketball team responded in dominating fashion Saturday, defeating UC Riverside 62-42.

Using 13-3 and 9-0 runs, the Gauchos doubled up on Riverside 28-14 and eventually took a 32-17 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>“Coming off a bad game, we came out this afternoon with a chip on our shoulder, knowing that we had to come out fired up because the effort we came out with [against Fullerton] was unacceptable,” Nesbit said.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB shot an incredible 53.6 percent from the field in the first half, compared to 25 percent from Riverside.</p>\n<p>“We just pushed. We didn’t think about anything,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “We didn’t run plays; it was just transition. We were attacking and had a lot of points in the paint, so I think that’s what led to the win.”</p>\n<p>While in the past, the Gauchos have often started the second half complacent when they have held large leads and have watched their advantage disappear, UCSB continued to keep its foot on the gas, extending its lead to as many as 21 points with 14:13 remaining.</p>\n<p>“[At halftime], I just challenged them that it was zero to zero,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I wanted them to understand that when you get a team down and you’re on their court, [you have to] to put them away and the upperclassmen accepted that challenge. Even when UCR made a couple runs, you could see the look on their face like ‘we’re not going to let this happen again.’”</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB outshot Riverside 46.7 to 35.6 percent and outscored the Highlanders 30-14 in the paint.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara featured three players in double figures with junior guard Melissa Zornig and Mason each tallying 10, but it was Nesbit who had the hot hand for UCSB, scoring 20 points, which ties her career-high. Nesbit also finished with three assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“She has the ability to score points on any given night,” Mitchell said. “But for me, the importance was that she got after it on the defensive end of things and controlled the tempo with her calmness on the ball.”</p>\n<p>Mason also stood out for UCSB, starting for the Gauchos and recording a double-double. Along with her 10 points, she grabbed 12 rebounds, breaking her previous career-high of 10.</p>\n<p>“I just felt real free today,” Mason said. “It was fun and I’m glad I could do it in front of my family. My focus was going after everything.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos held the Highlanders to 35.6 percent shooting and forced 19 turnovers, compared to just 10 for UCSB. Santa Barbara also outrebounded Riverside 36-27.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 11 steals is the most ever during Mitchell’s reign.</p>\n<p>“I’m satisfied with the way our kids recovered after a disappointing loss,” Mitchell said. “They came out extremely focused and competitive, so overall, I’m satisfied with our play and of course, the outcome.”</p>\n<p>Next week, UCSB returns home for its final games of the regular season, hosting Long Beach State and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50444\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50444\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/","id":644,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[643,642,641],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps San Jose State at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8153.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8153.jpg?resize=400%2C267&ssl=1","description":"Just three days after a crushing defeat to UCLA, the UCSB baseball team bounced back with a three-game sweep of San Jose State.

UCSB scored first in the bottom of the fourth, but San Jose retaliated in the top of the sixth .</p>\n<p>With the game tied up 1-1 in the bottom of the tenth, sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell got aboard with a two-out single to right field. Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward was hit by a pitch to bring up junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon. Trinkwon hit a high fly ball just foul down the left field line that dropped between the left fielder and shortstop. With the extra life, Trinkwon made the Spartans pay with a two-strike, two-out single into left field to drive in Newell from second base.</p>\n<p>“After that ball fell I was completely confident I was going to get it done,” Trinkwon said. “I’m pretty confident in my two-strike approach. These guys had some good stuff, but I knew I’d be able to fight off his good stuff and find a hole like I did.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, freshman Justin Jacome pitched a gem. Jacome allowed nine hits in seven innings, allowing just two runs and struck out three while walking none to earn his first win of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB was behind 2-1 after five innings of play, but would go on to score runs in the bottom of the fifth and sixth innings before a big four-run seventh would put the Spartans away for good. The Gauchos scored seven runs on 14 hits, headlined by Trinkwon’s 3-4 day with two RBI.</p>\n<p>In game one Friday, sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone scattered nine hits over eight innings, allowing four runs, just one earned.</p>\n<p>UCSB had taken the lead early when sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa singled in a run in the first. Santa Barbara followed up with two more runs in the second for a 3-0 lead. In the top of the fifth inning, two Gaucho errors led to three unearned runs and a four-run inning for the Spartans, who would take the lead briefly until the bottom of the seventh when Woodward tripled down the right field line and Trinkwon hit a sacrifice fly that tied the game back at four.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the ninth inning, two hit batters and an intentional walk loaded the bases for Mahle, who walked to push in the winning run and give the Gauchos 5-4 win.</p>\n<p>Today UCSB will play host to visitor St. Mary’s to end the nine-game homestand. The game begins at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesake Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-sweeps-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-sweeps-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-sweeps-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-sweeps-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-sweeps-san-jose-state-at-home/","id":4496,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4495,4494,4493],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go Perfect 5-0 at Campus Diamond","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7336.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7336.jpg?resize=400%2C267&ssl=1","description":"In its second home stand of the young season, the UCSB softball team returned to form with a 5-0 sweep in the Gaucho Classic II, defeating Seattle three times and South Dakota State twice. “We playe...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its second home stand of the young season, the UCSB softball team returned to form with a 5-0 sweep in the Gaucho Classic II, defeating Seattle three times and South Dakota State twice.</p>\n<p>“We played really strong; we had some roller coaster games but we ended up getting wins,” sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom said.</p>\n<p>With the undefeated weekend, the Gauchos improved to 14-5 on the season.

Wisdom dominated the Redhawks, pitching a complete game, throwing eight strikeouts and giving up only two hits and no runs.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the sixth, Wisdom showed her two-way dominance by blasting a home run over left field to bring senior shortstop Keilani Jennings home and extend the lead to 4-0. She then cleaned up the next three batters she faced to finish a clean weekend sweep of the competition.</p>\n<p>In the previous game against South Dakota State, the Gauchos’ offense was as formidable as it was all weekend. Wisdom opened up the scoring with a two-run single in the first inning and the Gauchos eventually pushed the lead to 6-0 .</p>\n<p>Wisdom picked up her third RBI of the game with an exclamatory solo home run in the seventh to seal an 8-3 UCSB win.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s game against South Dakota, UCSB pulled out its third straight down-to-the-wire win, defeating the Jacks 5-4. South Dakota started to pull away after a two-run homer by junior catcher Sammy Bingham in the fourth inning to push the lead to 3-0, but the Gauchos began answering back with a big fourth inning of their own, scoring three runs to tie the game at 3-3.</p>\n<p>After the Jacks took a 4-3 lead in the fifth, the Gauchos again responded with a two-run double by Wisdom and did not relinquish their lead.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s first game against Seattle was the longest of the season for UCSB, as they headed into the ninth inning tied at four.</p>\n<p>Both teams would trade blows again in the eighth, after Wisdom took home on a Redhawk error and Seattle answered back with a sacrifice fly to tie it at 4-4 and send the game into the ninth. In the 10th, freshman outfielder Arianna Palomares came up with her biggest play of the year; a two-run homer to put UCSB up 6-4 and seal the win.</p>\n<p>The opening game of the Classic against Seattle was another close one, with the Gauchos trailing 2-1 heading into the bottom of the sixth. Stark came up clutch just as she did in the previous UCSB home game, knocking a double up the middle to bring in Boser and Jennings and give the Gauchos a 3-2 win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game will be against Weber State on Thursday in the Mayfair Invitational in Long Beach.</p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50447\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-go-perfect-5-0-at-campus-diamond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50447\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-go-perfect-5-0-at-campus-diamond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-go-perfect-5-0-at-campus-diamond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-go-perfect-5-0-at-campus-diamond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-go-perfect-5-0-at-campus-diamond/","id":986,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[985,984,983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns Big West Tournament Berth","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball-file-photo.jpg?resize=400%2C305&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team proved Saturday they could win the pivotal games that can make or break a season.

Big Al scored 24 in the second half alone and finished 11-20 from the field and 10-13 from the free throw line on the night.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to get in the rhythm of things and to get a little bit of my swagger back,” Big Al said. “It was really fun to be out there; the energy was great from the team.”</p>\n<p>In his first game back from injury, junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle scored a season-high 10 points off the bench with eight coming in the second half. Junior guard Kyle Boswell also scored 18 for the Gauchos, a game after scoring a career-high 27 in Thursday’s loss at Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“The first half, we just missed a lot of layups and open shots; we just couldn’t quite get it in sync,” Coach Williams said. “In the second half, Al, Boswell and Keegan Hornbuckle—the three of them really just took the game over.”</p>\n<p>UCSB used the trio to overpower the Matadors, scoring 54 points in the second half alone. Freshman guard Michael Bryson added 14 points on the night, but kept the Gauchos in the game early with 13 of those points coming in the first half.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we knew we were in control of the game,” Big Al said. “There were just a couple of plays in the first half that could have had us with a lead at halftime. We were just focused in the locker room knowing that we could go out and win this game, all we had to do was execute a little better and we did that as a team.”</p>\n<p>The performances from Boswell and Hornbuckle were especially significant for UCSB as both players are coming back from injuries that left the Gauchos with a depleted squad of only eight eligible players.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara looked strong in its victory, outrebounding the Matadors 34-33, committing fewer turnovers (14-13) and shooting a higher percentage from the field (50.8-42.6 percent).</p>\n<p>“Getting back healthy at this time of the year is really important for us,” Big Al said. “Once we get back to full strength, we’ll be a really tough team to beat. We’re looking forward to carrying on this momentum we have right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home to face Cal State Fullerton on Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/","id":651,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[650,649,648],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finding Their Stride at the Right Time","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB Men’s Volleyball Has Won Two Straight Entering Second Half of Conference  Winner of its last two games, the UCSB men’s volleyball team heads into tonight’s match against No. 3 Long Beach S...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2><em>UCSB Men’s Volleyball Has Won Two Straight Entering Second Half of Conference </em></h2>\n<p>Winner of its last two games, the UCSB men’s volleyball team heads into tonight’s match against No. 3 Long Beach State looking to end its seven-game road trip on the right foot before it begins a stretch of five games at home.</p>\n<p>Coming off a critical victory against No. 6 UCLA, the Gauchos are just as confident they can deliver the same result against an opposition they have beaten earlier in the season in the Long Beach 49ers.</p>\n<p>“We know that this team is one of the top teams in our league, but we beat them in the beginning of the season,” senior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “We’re very confident that we can take it to them at their place and shut them out this year.

Currently 7-11 overall and 5-9 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, Santa Barbara is fully aware of the importance of this game as it sits in 10th place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Long Beach enters with a 12-4 record overall and 10-3 in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>In its last game against UCLA on Wednesday, UCSB handily took care of business versus the Bruins, winning 3-1. The third time was the charm on this occasion for the Gauchos as it was their first win against UCLA this year, after two previous meetings between the two teams resulted in losses.</p>\n<p>“[Beating UCLA] was one of the best feelings I’ve ever had,” Evans said. “It was surreal because we really thought we could take it to them. We had a great feeling before playing this match and we really stuck it on them.”</p>\n<p>A major factor to UCSB’s win was its passing game. The team limited its errors and was on point on the offensive side of the ball. Defensively, junior libero Chad Kingi delivered key saves throughout the four sets and ended with a team-high 11 digs for the night.</p>\n<p>“We were aggressive on the service line and we knew we needed to pass well because [UCLA] has great servers,” Evans said. “We got a couple good digs in the moment and we shut down their good players. We employed our defensive strategies very well and it worked out.”</p>\n<p>In their first conference game this year back in early January, the 49ers lost in straight sets to the Gauchos. With each team changing drastically since its first encounter, Santa Barbara understands it will not be able to rely on the same game plan it did earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“Both teams, us and them, have changed a lot since the beginning of the season,” Evans said. “I think we’re going to try a couple of the same things, but we’re also going to employ a new strategy based on what they’ve improved on and who their best players are.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match against the 49ers is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/finding-their-stride-at-the-right-time/","id":5331,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5330,5329,5328],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prepare for Pair  of Matches in Texas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This weekend the UCSB women’s tennis team travels to Arlington, Texas for a pair of out-of-conference matches against Stephen F.

The win pushed the Gauchos’ record to 6-3 overall and 2-2 in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its strong performance against Northridge and its quick start to the season, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association ranked UCSB No. 54 in its weekly rankings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is the highest ITA ranking the Gauchos have achieved in over 20 years, showing the profound impact new Head Coach Simon Thibodeau has made in his first season.</p>\n<p>UCSB has won three of its last four matches and has a good chance of further improving its record against the Stephen F. Austin Ladyjacks and the UT Arlington Mavericks.</p>\n<p>The Ladyjacks have had a rough start to their season, evidenced by their 2-6 overall record. UCSB will be the highest-ranked team the Ladyjacks have faced so far this season, and they are coming off a 0-7 loss against No. 55 ranked Missouri.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks, on the other hand, have not yet been tested nearly as much as the Gauchos or the Ladyjacks. UT Arlington is 1-2 on the year, and its meets against Stephen F. Austin and UCSB will only be its fourth and fifth meets of the season, respectively.</p>\n<p>Despite going into the weekend as likely favorites for both of its meets, one aspect that UCSB will look to improve is its performance in doubles competition.</p>\n<p>Despite sweeping the Cal State Northridge in singles, the Gauchos struggled against the Matadors in doubles. Sophomore April Scatliffe and freshman Priscilla Garcia lost their doubles match 8-1, while senior Erica Cano and junior Paola Cos lost 8-3.</p>\n<p>On Saturday Scatliffe, UCSB’s No. 1, will look to improve on her 3-3 record against sophomore Malena Gordo of the Ladyjacks, whose record stands at 2-5. The following day, Scatliffe will take on junior Giado D’ortona of the Mavericks, who is 1-1 so far this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s matches are set to begin at 10 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-prepare-for-pair-of-matches-in-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-prepare-for-pair-of-matches-in-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-prepare-for-pair-of-matches-in-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-prepare-for-pair-of-matches-in-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-prepare-for-pair-of-matches-in-texas/","id":531,"author":{"id":291,"name":"Austin Richardson"},"related":[530,529,528],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":156,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
