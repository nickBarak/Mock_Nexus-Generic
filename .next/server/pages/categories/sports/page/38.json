Childress, a Class of 2017 graduate, was the team’s only senior last season. The final chapter of his collegiate career wasn’t the happiest farewell as the Gauchos went a horrid 6-22, 4-12 in Big West play.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since departing from UCSB, Childress has continued to play overseas. A native of Hawthorne, Calif., Childress is a long way from home. But his passion for basketball is the drive that keeps him motivated to continue to chase his dream of playing basketball.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I was unable to conduct an in-person interview with Childress due to his overseas travels, being able to complete this Q&amp;A session with him was an experience in itself.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before we begin here is the highlight tape of his first year overseas, enjoy: <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pP8XeyfsGqo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br>\n<em><strong>Sean White: How was your experience playing in the British Basketball League? How was the transition from college to overseas?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Eric Childress: </strong>Playing in the British Basketball League was pretty difficult. I say this only because I feel like the club I was with had the potential to be very talented, but we underperformed and many different circumstances made it hard for us to reach our potential. The transition from college to overseas, I’d say, can be different for every person depending on the country you land in. For me, going to the U.K., I was very fortunate in going to a place where everyone spoke English and it was the most similar to the U.S. With that being said, if I were to start my career somewhere in Asia, South America or even here in Georgia I think I would have struggled at first because of the language barrier and it being such a big culture shock. It’s hard for me to just maneuver around town like I was in Leeds.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Did you get in touch with any former Gauchos who play or have played overseas prior to starting your pro career?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yeah, prior to leaving I talked to players like James Nunally &amp; Orlando Johnson, who came back to Santa Barbara during the summer, and kind of picked their brains about the whole overseas experience. Also, it’s easier for me to get in contact with Alan Williams, Nate Garth, Zalmico Harmon and Michael Bryson, so whenever I have a big question that I feel like I can’t really get on my own I’ll reach out and see if they can offer me some advice from their experiences.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: How did you know at the time that Leeds Force was the right fit for you? Did you have an agent help with that choice?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>I feel like you never really know which team is the right fit until you get there. You kind of watch film of the league and past seasons, but ultimately the guys you see from the last season are likely gone to another country or [have] signed with another team in the league. When I got to Leeds I had no clue what I was getting myself into. We had, of course, your local players for the team, and many imports, as they call us, from different places such as Houston and Florida in the States, then a player for Greece, one from Switzerland, one from Lithuania and one from Germany. So it’s more on the club to make sure our playing styles complement each other when they offer us to play for them. My choice to go play for Leeds was made by my agent and me. We felt like the U.K. was a good starting place for me to go because of the similarities to the U.S., and the British Basketball League (BBL) is a good league with many talented players.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: I see you’re no longer a member of Leeds Force? Was that by choice or was it a matter of both sides just not being able to agree?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>After giving Leeds a shot, the club and I both agreed that things weren’t going in the direction we hoped for and mutually decided to go our separate ways. I wish those guys the best over there for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: You played with guys like Alan “Big Al” Williams, Michael Bryson and more. How often do you stay in touch with them? Do you ever seek advice from them for anything?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>One of the greatest things about UCSB — and I commend Coach Williams for this — was that he brought in some of the best dudes I’ll ever meet. With that being said, I speak to pretty much all my teammates from the past days because of the old group chats that we had in college and are still active in. As far as advice, I try to figure out some stuff on my own. If I can’t get it and [am] really struggling, then I’ll reach out to them or even old high school family such as my coaches and old teammates and see what advice they can offer me in this experience.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Have you had a chance to peep this year’s men’s basketball team? If so, what have your thoughts been especially since the program now has a new head coach in Joe Pasternack?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>This year’s team has been amazing. I’m really happy for those guys that had to go through that tough season last year and [am] juiced for Gabe [Vincent] to be out there performing great after that injury last year. Glad to see Jalen [Canty] and Ami [Lakoju] out there on the floor after their situation last year as well. I can’t even lie: I was jealous, and I told them this when watching them play against Cal State Fullerton this year. Their play style differs so much from ours last year that it really seems like those dudes that are on the floor are genuinely having fun with the game, and I feel like the most important [thing] is having fun while competing at a high level. I’m happy they adjusted to Coach P’s system so quickly, and I think he did an outstanding job with those guys with getting them to compete on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: What’s next for Eric Childress? I see you’ve recently announced your signing with a team in the country of Georgia; what convinced you to do so?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yes, I recently signed to play and finish my rookie year here in Batumi, Georgia with BC Batumi. The biggest thing was that I didn’t want what happened in Leeds to affect my love for the game. I’ve been playing and giving my all to this sport for as long as I can remember, and it’s always been a dream of mine to be a professional basketball player. That was the biggest choice in deciding to come here and continue on. What also factored in was realizing that I get to travel the world, see many different places and cultures, try different things and gain new experiences that many people aren’t fortunate [enough] to do, so I’m blessed to even have this opportunity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Any good or unfamiliar meals overseas that you liked or disliked?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>As for as meals go, I’m one of the pickiest eaters you’ll ever meet. Shout-out to my mom and pops for teaching me how to cook. I feel like one day I’ll venture out and try something new, but if it doesn’t pass the smell test, I don’t think it’s for me.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Feb.

However, they then went on to win five in a row.</p>\n<p>UCSB has shown resilience and the ability to heat up, two very useful attributes as the second half of the season progresses. As per usual, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson is focusing on what’s to come and how to improve.</p>\n<p>In preparation for Thursday’s contest against Riverside, Henrickson stressed the unique nature of the Highlanders’ offense and how her team will defend it.</p>\n<p>“Riverside is a lot of five-out motion, cuts, slips, curls, guards posting. It’s a lot of difference. It’s a very different style than anyone else in the league, so it’s been trying to get comfortable with how we’re going to play it,” Henrickson said. “We need to minimize the number of catches in those spots by their players because it’s their motion and movement but players have tendencies. It’s a little bit of recognizing who am I guarding and what does my guy like to do.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Riverside’s offense has taken its toll on teams this season through exploiting mismatches.</p>\n<p>“They’re pretty balanced, so they bring some mismatch problems for us,” Henrickson said. “Their guards are going to post, which we don’t see a lot.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Henrickson, the Gauchos have plenty of options at the guard position and can continue to lean on their freshman point guard Sarah Bates as senior guard Drea Toler works toward returning to 100 percent.</p>\n<p>Bates leads Santa Barbara in scoring during conference play, averaging 14.6 points per game, but she’s not just finding the net. Also leading the Gauchos in the assist category, Bates has dished out an average of 3.1 dimes per game in conference matchups.</p>\n<p>Looking closer at Riverside, the Highlanders have fallen in their last four games, so they’re likely eager to get back on track. UCSB’s last meeting with Riverside was in last season’s Big West Quarterfinals, where the Gauchos won 81-71 to advance.</p>\n<p>Win or lose against Riverside, Santa Barbara will turn around to visit CSU Fullerton on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Similar to Riverside, the Titans are in a rut of their own, having lost five in a row. Despite Fullerton’s recent struggles, Henrickson again understands that records aren’t everything.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got good size inside,” Henrickson said. “Good shooters, good athletes. They’re much improved, playing with a lot of confidence. They’ve had big wins at home and been in one-possession games, so they’re much improved from last year.”</p>\n<p>Last season, the Titans went 1-15 in conference play and a dismal 4-25 overall, losing both games in their series against the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With the potential to climb the rankings on the road, Santa Barbara is aiming to keep up its pace as well as defensive prowess.</p>\n<p>“I think for us, how aggressive we were in transition, we scored 23 points in transition which is a season-high for us,” Henrickson said, “I thought we had tremendous energy [against Hawaii] where we were able to take away some of their go-to looks, which is what we want to do against Riverside.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on UC Riverside tonight at SRC Arena at 7 p.m. UCSB and CSU Fullerton will play at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 10, in Titan Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/","id":938,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[937,936,935],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Come Up Short Twice in Three Matches, Get One Win in Home Opener Doubleheader","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB played three matches in two days, and the results showed it.

The Gauchos began their weekend with a match at No. 6 Pepperdine on Friday, and then faced off against the University of San Francisco and Kansas State in their home opener on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against Pepperdine ended very poorly for the now 3-4 Gauchos, who were dominated by the Wave 7-0. Things appeared to be unbalanced from the get-go on Friday, with the Wave shutting out the Gauchos in back-to-back games in doubles play.</p>\n<p>The imbalance continued throughout the match, as the Gauchos struggled to keep up with Pepperdine’s four nationally ranked singles players. Sophomore Amit Lev Ari came the closest to winning the Gauchos their only set victory of the day in her first set against Pepperdine junior, No. 44 Dzina Milovanovic; however, Lev Ari fell short 7-6, and lost her subsequent set, which brought the match to an end.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos’ home opener on Saturday would not prove to be much easier, with a challenging doubleheader against USF and Kansas State. Despite suffering a tough loss the day before, the Gauchos went into their home opener with confidence, and a burning desire to bounce back from their trip to Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos made quick work of USF, routing the Dons 4-0, and losing only a single set on court one.</p>\n<p>“We were not so happy with the way we competed at Pepperdine, we lost a bit of confidence with that match, but we were able to win against San Francisco. “We were just a little bit better there,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>The match against the Dons helped the Gauchos regain some of their confidence, and prepare for a more difficult matchup against Kansas State.</p>\n<p>The Wildcats and the Gauchos fought tooth and nail throughout the afternoon, but Kansas State came out on top with a score of 4-3. The Wildcats pulled ahead early in doubles play, after winning two games back-to-back against the Gauchos, leaving the third unfinished.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would soon tie things up in singles play, with the help of freshman Lise Sentenac, who dominated the Wildcats’ senior Carolina Lewis with scores of 6-0 and 6-1 in both of her sets.</p>\n<p>Both teams would trade blows in singles play, and the match would ultimately be decided by the game between UCSB senior Natalie Da Silveira and Kansas State freshman Rosanna Maffei. Da Silveira secured a 6-2 victory in the first set, but Maffei came back in the second set, defeating Da Silveira 6-1.</p>\n<p>By the start of the third set, the match was tied 3-3, making it the set that would decide the outcome of the match. The pair fought hard, but in the end, Maffei would come out on top 7-6 at the end of the nail-biting final set.</p>\n<p>It was an emotional loss for the Gauchos, who were hoping for a clean sweep in front of their home crowd. The hard-fought loss to Kansas State brought the Gauchos to a 3-4 record on the season.</p>\n<p>Coach Thibodeau acknowledged the areas where his team struggled, but he applauded their effort throughout a restless weekend.</p>\n<p>“I thought they fought really hard against Kansas State. We got a bit of a slow start in doubles, but in singles we gave ourselves a chance to win,” Thibodeau said. “We left it on the courts, but its good experience to play these kinds of matches because it might happen in the future.”</p>\n<p>Coach Thibodeau and the Gauchos will have plenty of time to recover and prepare for future matches, with their next being against Saint Mary’s on Saturday, Feb. 17 and No. 14 California on Sunday, Feb. 18. With two full weeks of rest, the Gauchos are likely to come back stronger for their trip to the Bay Area.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/ucsb-come-up-short-twice-in-three-matches-get-one-win-in-home-opener-doubleheader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/ucsb-come-up-short-twice-in-three-matches-get-one-win-in-home-opener-doubleheader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/ucsb-come-up-short-twice-in-three-matches-get-one-win-in-home-opener-doubleheader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/ucsb-come-up-short-twice-in-three-matches-get-one-win-in-home-opener-doubleheader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/ucsb-come-up-short-twice-in-three-matches-get-one-win-in-home-opener-doubleheader/","id":37,"author":{"id":55,"name":"Andrew Bishop"},"related":[36,35,34],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Historic Home Streak Lives On with Win Over CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB keeps its best start in program history alive with a victory over the visiting CSUN Matadors.

When it finally did, it did so in a hurry.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos rode a 19-1 run over seven minutes in the second half to a 75-51 victory over the Matadors, pushing UCSB to 18-5 this season and 7-2 in the Big West. The win was also the Gauchos’ 11<sup>th</sup> home victory in a row to open the year, the best home start in school history.</p>\n<p>“When Coach (Pasternak) came in, he wanted to establish the Thunderdome as a good home court,” sophomore guard Max Heidegger said. “Hopefully the years will pass and even after we’re gone it’ll still be rocking. We want to create a legacy here, and that’s what Coach [Pasternak] wants to do.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A 24-point final margin suggests complete dominance, but that certainly wasn’t the case for much of Saturday’s game. UCSB and CSUN traded baskets and stops throughout the first half, which saw six lead changes, and neither team was able to get much going offensively.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot just 42 percent from the field, and 20 percent from three, in the first 20 minutes. CSUN was even less effective, shooting 31 percent on field goals, a testament to both UCSB’s defense as well as the Matadors’ general inability to put the ball in the basket.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s saving grace in that cold first half was their rebounding, which was something of a surprise considering standout big man Jalen Canty’s absence Saturday night due to an indefinite suspension for a violation of team rules. Even without the 6-8 forward averaging 7.8 rebounds per game, the Gauchos were able to turn their 10 first half offensive rebounds into 10 second-chance points.</p>\n<p>While CSUN’s shooting problems persisted into the second half, UCSB seemed to find a way to shoot through their problems. The Gauchos rebounded in the last 20 minutes by going 50 percent from the field and 55 percent from three-point land, a major catalyst in their 43-point second half explosion.</p>\n<p>“Guys just started hitting shots,” Heidegger said. “[…] We were getting the same quality shots all game, but there was a stretch there when they all just started going down, so that helped us increase the lead.”</p>\n<p>Another major catalyst was graduate transfer Leland King II. Playing without his usual frontcourt mate Canty, King was dominant Saturday night with 25 points, tied for his season-high, and 17 rebounds, his season-best outright.</p>\n<p>“The greatest rebounder I ever coached was Leon Powe at Cal […] and to me Leland’s a better rebounder than him,” Pasternak said. “[Powe] played for the Boston Celtics. Leland’s ranked number 12<sup>th</sup> in the country in rebounding […] To me, rebounding translates to the next level. I think he’s a pro, and he showed it tonight.”</p>\n<p>King controlled the game from the start, with a 10 point, 13 rebound double-double in the just the first half, but really turned on the offensive jets in the last 20 minutes. It was King that kickstarted UCSB’s game-sealing run with two straight buckets, including a running hook with 9:52 to go that pushed the forward past 1,000 points in his career.</p>\n<p>Ami Lakoju was Canty’s replacement as King’s partner in the starting frontcourt, and the 6-8 junior filled in admirably with 10 points and eight rebounds in 20 minutes. It was Lakoju who built on King’s two baskets by outmuscling two CSUN defenders and jamming a putback dunk in over their heads, pushing UCSB’s lead to 12 and electrifying the Thunderdome crowd.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game was particularly special to Lakoju, who was playing in front of his father for just the second time in his college career. The elder Lakoju, a minister and family counselor from Harlem, made the long trip to see his son play, an important boost for the junior.</p>\n<p>“It was a blessing to see him here,” Lakoju said. “He kind of surprised me with that visit but nonetheless I’m happy to see him here and for him to see us get two wins.</p>\n<p>Point guard Marcus Jackson followed up Lakoju’s dunk with two straight jumpers to stretch the lead to 16 points. Jackson, who has struggled with his shot recently, put up 12 points in the second half alone, an important development for the graduate transfer.</p>\n<p>“Marcus has been in kind of a shooting funk, and I wanted to give him some confidence,” Pasternak said. “[…] Sometimes it becomes mind over matter, so I wanted him to shoot. I started calling plays for him to get his confidence going. He hit a couple of shots and hopefully that’ll carry over.”</p>\n<p>Jackson had perhaps the team’s most balanced stat line of the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists. It was his corner three with 3:48 remaining that put the Gauchos up 68-44 and prompted Pasternak to begin emptying the UCSB bench.</p>\n<p>Playing without Canty, the Gauchos went to their bench earlier and more often than usual. Jarriesse Blackmon played 18 high-energy minutes, going 4-7 for eight points and six rebounds, while Christian Terrell dished out six assists without turning the ball over once in his 24 minutes.</p>\n<p>“I thought Jarriesse Blackmon gave us incredible energy,” Pasternak said. “To get that kind of contribution from him off the bench was really big for us.”</p>\n<p>The strong bench performances allowed Pasternak and his staff to give several starters lighter loads on Saturday. Gabe Vincent played just five minutes in the second half in order to rest a sore calf, and Max Heidegger was able to give his sore back a little bit more of a rest than it got in Thursday’s overtime marathon against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Whatever rest the Gauchos got on Saturday will be especially important come Thursday night, when UCSB travels to UC Davis to play for Big West supremacy. The Aggies pulled out a 105-104 victory over Long Beach State on Saturday night to keep pace with the Gauchos at 7-2, setting up a major clash next week.</p><div

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions all weekend long for the UCSB men’s volleyball team as it was just recently on the road for two back-to-back matches against Brigham Young University.</p>\n<p>UCSB split its pair of matches against the Cougars, leaving the Gauchos with a 4-4 record. It managed to pull off an impressive 3-0 shutout over BYU on Friday, but couldn’t sustain the momentum as it was shutout itself the following Saturday. BYU is now 6-4.</p>\n<p>The first set of Friday’s first match was quite the offensive spectacle as both teams were making the most of almost every attacking opportunity. Although, the Gauchos were able to run away with it by a close 25-23 end result; with four kills each from UCSB’s sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders, sophomore outside hitter Roy McFarland, and junior outside hitter Corey Chavers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the second set, each sides’ defense started to tighten up and the improvements were shown as a total of 6 blocks, 3 apiece, were recorded. For the Gauchos, the standout performer in this one was sophomore setter Randy DeWeese who posted up two of those three blocks from his playmaker position. DeWeese would go on and also conclude the day with a game high of 4 total blocks to go along with his 31 team assists. UCSB would then go on to clinch this second set by a score of 25-20.</p>\n<p>By this point the BYU Cougars were on the ropes and left their best for last in an attempt to cancel out the away side’s clean sweep. Nearing the end of the third set, the Gauchos were down by only a pair of scores as the board read 21-23. Then, thanks to a flurry of attack errors and a service mistake is what ultimately decided the game as the Gauchos would then go on and set up the final 27-25 score to earn both the road victory and clean 3-0 set sweep over the No. 6 BYU.</p>\n<p>As for Saturday’s game two, which took place the next evening, UCSB was in search of pulling off a sweep over their opponents whilst still in enemy territory. Set No. 1 seemed to go in favor of the Gauchos for most of the way, yet failure to halt BYU’s .600 hitting percentage in the first set eventually gave the Cougars the early 1-0 lead to start the match.</p>\n<p>Set two experienced a complete advantage for BYU as their freshman opposite hitter Gabi Garcia Fernandez put up 6 total kills. This one got out of the Gauchos reach early on as the Cougars never gave up the lead through it all and secured the 25-20 victory.</p>\n<p>Then for the final set, the Gauchos gave it their all but an outstanding defensive performance from the other side of the court held them to a .138 hitting percentage and a doubled amount of blocks to go with. Disappointingly, UCSB then lost the day by a final result of 0-3 as back to back sweeps were experienced on both ends in just a matter of two days. Aggregate team stats show the Gauchos hitting for a cumulative .263 hitting percentage, 11.5 blocks, and 6 aces; compared to the Cougars’ .337 hitting percentage average, 16.5 blocks, and 6 aces as well.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s volleyball program will continue its 2018 regular season on Wednesday, Feb. 21, with a home game against Pepperdine just before the first conference matchup of the year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80851\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80851\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/","id":4941,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[4940,4939,4938],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Edelman’s Career Night Gets Gauchos Back on Track With Win Over Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos get rid of their two-game skid with a win over the Rianbow Wahine.

After opening Big West play 3-0, the Gauchos are fifth in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>While UCSB snapped its two-game losing streak on Saturday, Hawaii has now lost its last two games and lands it in last place of the Big West. Hawaii is now 9-14 overall and 2-8 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game with a much-improved shooting effort. The Gauchos were determined to get the ball inside to Edelman early, and they did just that.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter alone, Edelman had 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Hawaii’s offense seemed a bit disjointed in the first quarter of play, but a diversified scoring effort from five different players allowed the Rainbow Wahine to keep within a possession after one quarter of play.</p>\n<p>Up 19-16 to start the second quarter, UCSB kept its foot on the gas, opening with an 8-0 run. The run was led by none other than Edelman, who had 8 in the quarter, and Chaya Durr. After shooting 57.1 percent in the first, Santa Barbara went on to shoot an even better 60 percent in the second.</p>\n<p>But, the Gauchos weren’t only scoring efficiently, they held Hawaii scoreless for nearly five minutes as they constructed their run. Despite shooting 3-for-10 in the quarter, Hawaii used those three buckets to go on a 6-0 run in the last two minutes. The run placed Hawaii within a manageable 8-point deficit, but Edelman sunk two free throws at the end of the first half to go up 10 again, 34-24.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke about her team’s performance in the second quarter, in which the Gauchos held Hawaii to only eight points.</p>\n<p>“I thought defensively, we were disruptive and forced turnovers and then scored off those turnovers,” she explained. “We were aggressive in passing lanes, we got on the floor for loose balls.”</p>\n<p>Consistency has been an issue for UCSB this season, but the Gauchos entered the third quarter with a sense of focus and determination to keep rolling.</p>\n<p>A barrage of three-pointers from Akilah Jennings, Sarah Bates, and Sarah Porter capped a 15-5 stretch for the Gauchos, going up 49-29 at the 5:07 mark. Down 20, the Rainbow Wahine, led by Sarah Toeaina, needed to make something happen.</p>\n<p>Toeaina got a pair of free throws to fall and shortly after made a layup in traffic for 4 points in 40 seconds to cap an 8-0 run, but the Gauchos stayed up 56-40 at the end of the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final quarter of play up 16, Santa Barbara looked to be in control, but the Gauchos’ shooting struggles resurfaced as they made only three field goals in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, Toeaina exploded for 13 points in the quarter as part of Hawaii’s continued comeback effort. From their 8-0 run to end the third, the Rainbow Wahine kept attacking in order to outscore the Gauchos 21-15 in the fourth. Toeaina, who struggled to get going early in the game, finished with 25 points.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Hawaii, its impressive comeback effort consisting of a 24-7 run was not enough, despite getting within 6. With only 30 seconds to go, Hawaii was forced to foul, sending Bates to the line. Bates, who finished with 13 points to accompany Edelman in double-digit scoring, confidently knocked down both. The Gauchos made all 8 of their final attempts from the charity stripe to close the game out 71-61.</p>\n<p>Behind Edelman’s 27 and 12 double-double, the Gauchos won the battle in the paint, outscoring the Rainbow Wahine 42-27 and outrebounded Hawaii 32-26.</p>\n<p>Guards Sarah Bates and Drea Toler finished with six assists each, but 21 turnovers by Santa Barbara marked a continuing issue for a team likely to be pressed by opponents.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to build off its win at UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton next week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/","id":898,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[897,896,895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl LII Sleeper Picks","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=953%2C647&ssl=1","description":"We all know about the big names going into Super Bowl 52, but what about the players that could prevail from under the radar?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>All-Pro Wide Receiver Santana Moss once said “Big time players make big time plays in big time games”. Often this is true, whether it be Eli Manning leading the Giants on a fourth quarter comeback, or Jerry Rice cutting through the Bengals defense play after play, many Super Bowls have been decided simply by a great player taking control of the game. Although football is most definitely a team sport, it is also one in which moments and players are mythologized. “The Drive” and “The Catch” are two examples of how football fans and analysts love to find and memorialize key plays and players, especially in the biggest game of all.</p>\n<p>Super Bowl LII will be between the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles and the AFC Champion New England Patriots. As a Giants fan who has rooted against both these teams on many occasions, it pains me to say that they both have proved to be the best in their respective conferences without a doubt. Even with key injuries to both squads (Carson Wentz being out for the Eagles, Gronk missing some time for the Pats) they have actually gotten stronger as units as the year has gone on, which is precisely why it is hard to single out who the x-factor’s will be on both sides. Instead of just choosing a player who I think will be the best for each team, I split potential players into two tiers based on how likely they are to win Super Bowl MVP and overall what their impact will be on the field.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80727\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2023388365\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80733\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80727\" data-attachment-id=\"80727\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/super-bowl-lii-sleeper-picks/tom-brady-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=953%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"953,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tom brady graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=888%2C671&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-80727\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=800%2C604\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"604\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?w=953&amp;ssl=1 953w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C580&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80727\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Son / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><b>The Favorites</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I predict that this year won’t be any different as both Tom Brady and Nick Foles, who have the best and second best chance to win the award according to Vegas, pretty much will have to carry their respective offenses. The Eagles and Patriots finished the regular season as bottom 10 rushing teams, and the Pats have only managed to muster up 73.5 yards per game in the playoffs. Foles and Brady have done a good job handling this load so far, as their 122 and 107 QBR show, but it remains to be seen which one will outshine the other.</p>\n<p><b>Dark Horses</b></p>\n<p>As opponents of the Patriots have learned in the past, the best way to mitigate Tom Brady’s impact is to get pressure on him, and if there is one thing Eagles DT Fletcher Cox knows how to do it’s creating pressure. His 10 combined tackles in the Postseason is the highest among Defensive Tackles, and while he only has one sack so far the amount of pressure he’s created indicates that he’s due for some more. If he’s able to disrupt the Patriots offensive line that’s only given up 3 sacks this year he could be heading home with the SBMVP trophy. On the Patriots side, Tight End Rob Gronkowski could be geared for a big game of his own. After being sidelined in the AFC Championship game with a concussion, Gronk will be looking to take advantage of his size in this upcoming matchup. He’ll have about a 6” height and 60 pound weight advantage over his primary defender who will be safety Malcolm Jenkins for the Eagles. IF Gronk is able to open up the field for Tom Brady, there’s no doubt that the Eagles will have a very tough time staying in the game, and he will likely be adding a Super Bowl MVP trophy to go along with a third championship ring.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

UCSB has now dropped to the 5<sup>th</sup> seed in the Big West, being edged out by their opponents – the Matadors are now the lone fourth seed in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t seem to buy a bucket, as they only shot a subpar 20.3 percent from the field. CSUN was only slightly above their opponents, shooting at 27.8 percent on the night.</p>\n<p>The game started off looking promising, as redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman notched the first 4 points in the game, sinking in two baskets. However, those would be the last points the Gauchos would score for the remainder of that quarter.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their anemic offense, the game didn’t look like it would run away from the home team, as the visitors only managed to put up 9 points on the board in the first period.</p>\n<p>The second quarter showed a bright spot for the Gauchos. They went on much needed 7-0 run sparked by sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez – Santa Barbara was trailing 14-4 prior to the offensive explosion.</p>\n<p>After the 2 points by Hernandez, freshman combo guard/forward Nina Radford splashed a 3-pointer and senior guard Makala Roper swished in a layup. The run narrowed the deficit gap, the home team then only down by 3.</p>\n<p>The rest of the game was more of the same for UCSB, as their offensive struggles continued.</p>\n<p>The score was 22-13 at the half, the visiting Matadors holding the lead.</p>\n<p>The defense for the Gauchos was thriving, getting stop after stop, and making it extremely difficult for their opponents to get any offensive flow going.</p>\n<p>Despite the superb defense, though, it was all for naught. Santa Barbara could not manage to get themselves into any offensive rhythm of some sort.</p>\n<p>Cal State Northridge was held to just 26 points after the half, showcasing UCSB’s stellar defense. However, the home team was trailing at the half and could not manage to pick up the pace and nix the deficit they were buried in, as they only were able to put up 17 points in the second half of the game.</p>\n<p>The road team ended the night on 15-for-54 shooting, while Santa Barbara had a 13-for-64 shooting night.</p>\n<p>Both teams were poor offensively, but they both also brought elite defenses to the game as well.</p>\n<p>The turnovers for both teams were less than ideal, CSUN having 15 and the home team giving away 13.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s bench outplayed their opponents, once again. UCSB’s bench contributed 16 points, compared to the Matador’s bench that only added 11.</p>\n<p>The leading scorer for the Gauchos was redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar, who scored 5 for the home team. Junior center Channon Fluker gave her team a boost with 15 points and was the leading scorer for CSUN.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara looks to bounce back from this loss as they look ahead to go against Hawaii on Saturday, February 3 at 2pm at home once again in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80844\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80844\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/","id":896,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[895,894,893],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Trip Down Memory Lane: Our Favorite Super Bowls","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nfl-ball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nfl-ball.jpg?resize=620%2C310&ssl=1","description":"Three of our staff writers give their takes on their favorite Super Bowl moments. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>What’s the Catch? by Kendra Jackson</strong></p>\n<p>It was Super Bowl LI. Everyone was speechless. The Patriots were getting smoked by the Atlanta Falcons.<br>\nTom Brady had been rushed, sacked and picked off all within the span of the first half, and it seemed as though Super Bowl victory No. 5 was just about out of reach for the New England Patriots.<br>\nThe score was 28-3 late in the third quarter, and nobody expected a blowout this bad.<br>\nComing back from such a big deficit would have been an impossible feat for most teams and for most quarterbacks … but not for Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.<br>\nNew England had scored 17 unanswered points, and it was officially a ball game.<br>\nThat’s when it happened. One of the most amazing moments in Super Bowl history.<br>\nThe Patriots were 64 yards from the end zone and were facing an 8-point deficit.<br>\nJust 2:28 was left in regulation, and the offense for New England was set. Shot gun formation – Brady set and ready to throw a bullet.<br>\nJulian Edelman was the intended receiver, but he was surrounded by three Falcons.<br>\nRobert Alford, the Falcons corner who picked off Brady in the first half, made what would have been one of the biggest ball deflections in his entire career. He hit the football as it was spiraling in the air, and it looked as if he had ruined the hopes of New England, all with a bat of the ball.<br>\nBut Alford didn’t pick the ball this time, he just deflected it in the air; the ball was still in play and fair game to be caught.<br>\nRegardless of all the traffic, Edelman managed to make one of the most prodigious catches in Super Bowl history.<br>\nEdelman was able to grab the batted ball, put his hand under it, secure it and prevent it from touching the ground.<br>\nIn that very moment, I knew, and everyone watching knew, that the Patriots were going to come back and win this game.<br>\nThat catch set up the tying touchdown that eventually led to the first overtime period in Super Bowl history, and another Lombardi Trophy for New England.<br>\nThat 23-yard pass across the middle was the fairytale to end what was a rollercoaster season for the Patriots. From the Deflategate scandal to Brady’s resulting suspension, New England wanted this one bad – and that catch made sure it happened.<br>\nIn the words of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, this win was “unequivocally the sweetest.”</p>\n<p><strong>Party Like It’s 1985 by Andrew Bishop</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To football fans of the 21st century, the idea of the Chicago Bears blowing out the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl seems almost unheard of. However, at the end of the 1985 season in Super Bowl XX, the Monsters of the Midway bullied the Patriots to a 46-10 victory.<br>\nEvery Chicago Bears fan who was alive in 1985 remembers the Bears’ triumphant quest for the Lombardi Trophy, and even those like myself who were born after their victory grew up hearing tales of the famed team that won the Bears their first and only Super Bowl.<br>\nScholars of the game regard the ’85 Bears as being one of the greatest teams in the history of the NFL. Much like the Patriots of today, everyone was betting on the Bears to win in ’85. Led by legendary head coach Mike Ditka, the Bears’ defense terrorized opposing teams in ways nobody had ever seen before, and their offense was carried almost singlehandedly by the immortal Walter Payton, the greatest professional running back of all time.<br>\nThroughout the season, the Bears dominated on the field, going 15-1 and leading the league on defense, and off the field, where Bears players recorded a Grammy-nominated hit single that raised over $300,000 for Chicago charities. Unlike the Patriots, who are viewed as the proverbial “bad guys” of the NFL, the ’85 Bears were lovable and dominant, and America couldn’t get enough of them.<br>\nThere were many great moments throughout the Bears’ season, Grammy nomination included, but the most memorable moment of all came in the third quarter of Super Bowl XX. Following a fumble recovery by Bears linebacker Wilber Marshall, the Bears managed to march down to the Patriots 1-yard line, where they employed their secret weapon: William Perry, a 6’2”, 350-pound defensive tackle-turned running back.<br>\nPerry, better known by his endearing nickname “The Fridge,” was one of the largest players to ever set foot on a professional football field, and Coach Ditka had the brilliant idea to give this monstrous human being the ball on the goal line. Outweighing nearly every opposing defender by over 100 pounds, the Fridge took the handoff and plowed through the line like a bowling ball, stumbling into the end zone for a touchdown.<br>\nThe nation erupted in collective laughter as the athletic giant ran over his opposition and capped his score off with a ball spike that puts Rob Gronkowski’s to shame. Despite lasting no more than a few seconds, that goal line play is remembered by football fans throughout the nation for all of eternity.<br>\nThe ’85 Bears are worshipped by fans throughout the nation, and reruns of the Patriots’ demolition in Super Bowl XX still play in American households to this day. It was an undeniably memorable season, which was capped off in spectacular fashion with a touchdown scored by a man the size of a refrigerator.</p>\n<p><strong>PATS INT SAVES THE DAY by Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a little difficult for me to pick just one Super Bowl moment in particular as my favorite.<br>\nI’m a Patriots fan, see, which means that not only am I incredibly obnoxious, but I also have a lot of good moments to choose from.<br>\nThe Adam Vinatieri field goals are pretty good, if a little fuzzy, and the whole fourth quarter against the Falcons was pretty amazing.<br>\nThe top spot, however, is reserved for the Malcolm Butler interception to win Super Bowl XLIX.<br>\nI was a junior in high school, only just starting to worry about getting into college.<br>\nI was actually enrolled in an SAT prep class that met on Sunday nights, even on Sunday nights that happened to be the Super Bowl.<br>\nI started the game off at a friend’s house, but I went back home to be with my mostly Patriot-supporting family after a tough third quarter put New England behind 24-14.<br>\nMy friends all hated the Patriots, rightfully so, and I wanted to be in a friendlier environment.<br>\nI could barely remember the Patriots’ three Super Bowl wins but I could definitely remember the two losses, and I wasn’t looking forward to a repeat of that feeling.<br>\nAs the Seahawks drove into Patriot territory late in the game, however, it looked as though that was what I was in for.<br>\nThe insane Jermaine Kearse catch, where he managed to catch a deflected pass by kicking it to himself while lying flat on his back, just reinforced my sense of doom.<br>\nThe Seahawks inched closer to the end zone, and I started resigning myself to a depressing SAT class.<br>\nThen Malcolm Butler undercut Kearse’s slant at the goal line and intercepted the ball with 20 seconds left in the game.<br>\nI went nuts, running around the house while my dad just stood there in disbelief.<br>\nThe feeling just got better as the Patriots ran down the clock and my family continued to celebrate. Then I immediately got in my car and drove to my class, blasting music and singing the whole way.<br>\nIt was the first Super Bowl win I was really conscious for, and it was amazing.<br>\nBeing at home made it even more special, pushing it over the top in my memory banks.<br>\nIf all goes right, I’ll have another good memory after Sunday, but it’s hard to see anything topping that interception.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Feb. 1</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/","id":3388,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[3387,3386,3385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Protect the Dome: Gauchos Host Hawaii Aiming to Seize Control of Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tied for first place in the Big West, the UCSB men's basketball team puts its 9-0 home record to the test in a match against third-place Hawaii on Thursday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB men’s basketball team is looking at one of its biggest tests so far this conference season as it gets set to take on Hawaii.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Warriors just recently lost their first place position in the Big West and have now dropped to third with a 4-2 conference record.

Each run the Gauchos made with their best weapons on the court was undone when they went to the bench, and ultimately they weren’t able to make a full comeback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the keys for Coach Pasternack going into Thursday night and, for the rest of the season, will be getting more from his bench and finding a way to make sure that the stars aren’t too worn down going into the postseason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key for UCSB will be staying perfect at home this year, which they have managed to do for a while sporting a 9-0 record at the Thunderdome so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are one win away from matching their best ever home start which was 10-0 done by the 1989-90 squad, which is a complete turnaround from their 5-8 home record last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Pasternack talked about the importance of building a strong home base in the beginning of the season, and the team’s great performances so far have given the UCSB community a lot to be excited about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendance has been great as of late, and if the Gauchos can continue their dominance we may be seeing an even bigger cultural shift on campus in terms of regaining pride in SB as a basketball school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple players to watch for on Hawaii are redshirt freshman guard Drew Buggs and senior forward Mike Thomas. Buggs is a quick yet high IQ guard that leads the Rainbow Warriors in both assists (3.8 per game) and steals (1.6). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he only scored nine points last time these teams met, he is a big part of the offensive gameplan for Hawaii, so it will be important for the Gauchos to limit him as a distributor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas is a much more straightforward down-low player, yet has shown how efficient he can be a scorer. He scores more per game than any other player on Hawaii averaging 11.3 points per contest, yet doesn’t take the most shots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His battle with Jalen Canty and Leland King down on the boards will be pivotal to how much success the Rainbow Warriors have on offense, and he will also have to play a huge role in producing on the offensive end for Hawaii as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have a lot riding on this game, and they’re aware that a chance to move up to first in the Big West and tie the best home start to the season ever doesn’t come around too often. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Warriors know that they can compete with UCSB, and won’t go down easy, but it’s going to be up to the Gauchos to use their talent and the home crowd to come out with a win.</span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, February 1st at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The game ended up being tied at the end of each quarter until UCSB edged out their opponents by one point in the final period of regulation.</p>\n<p>In considering the last 5 meetings between these two teams, the Gauchos have a slight advantage – having to beat the Matadors 3 out of the last 5 games.</p>\n<p>In order to come out on top, Santa Barbara will have to have another strong offensive game. And if they want to win convincingly, they must be sure to keep their opponents’ firepower at bay, otherwise, it’s going to be another tough one down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Players for the Gauchos to look out for, are the two leading scorers for the Matadors – junior center Channon Fluker and junior forward Tessa Boagni, who have both been on an explosive tangent this season.</p>\n<p>Averaging 20.9 and 11.9 points per game respectively, Fluker and Boagni are forced to be reckoned with on the court, as their potent offense has the potential to put extreme pressure on the defensive approach of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Last time these opponents faced off, they both hovered around 40% shooting for the game, but it will be crucial for one team to edge out the other in the offensive tug-of-war, just as UCSB previously did on the road in the fourth quarter, to solidify the win against the home team Matadors.</p>\n<p>Both teams had great rebounding in their previous meeting, with Cal State Northridge having the very slight advantage in that category.</p>\n<p>One category the Matadors dominated their opponents in during the last meeting, pointed in the paint.</p>\n<p>During the last game, Cal State Northridge won the high percentage shot battle, by having an impressive 48 points scored in the paint, to Santa Barbara’s less than half 22 points in the same category.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly both teams will need to put more concentration into their fourth-quarter play, as that was the detriment of both teams in their most recent losses to their opponents.</p>\n<p>Producing points in clutch time will be key if both teams score as consistently against each other as they did in the past.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a spectacular game last time UCSB went toe-to-toe with Cal State Northridge, contributing a double-double consisting of 23 points and 5 assists. A repeat effort from the volatile guard would increase the chances of Santa Barbara bouncing back and winning their next game.</p>\n<p>Bench play will be another factor to look out for, as UCSB will need its reserves to show up and show out if they want to gain separation throughout regulation.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is slated to play against Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, January 31, at home in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

happy to have finished second place,” Head Coach Steve Lass said. “We had some wonderful individual performances, especially on the final day, and we had a couple top-10 finishes so that was good.”</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, this marks its second, second-place finish of the season and is a sign of good things to come with the spring season just starting.

Pepperdine’s 37-shot win is the new program record for margin of victory.</p>\n<p>Bauman finished tied for fourth in the individual after finishing 7-over par 223 and carding an even 72 in the days’ final events to move up four spots. Most of the field finished above par for the tournament minus Pepperdine’s junior golfer Sahith Theegala who carded 11-under par 205. Theegala’s 16-shot win is the new school record for margin of victory.</p>\n<p>Tied for fourth with Bauman was CSUN’s senior Felix Mory who won last years individual at the Big West Championships. As a whole, Cal State Northridge finished the worst of the seven competing Big West teams finishing in 13th out of 15 place.</p>\n<p>“Felix is a really outstanding player and Brandon is too so it was great to see them play well,” Lass said. “It was nice to beat all of the Big West teams here and have them worry about us here during the spring season. I want out guys to have the confidence to know we are a bit better than these good teams.”</p>\n<p>Junior Nick Swanson also had a great final day carding 4-under par 68, the second-best mark of the day, to help him finish tied for eighth at the Challenge. Swanson also had the second most birdies of anyone at the tournament with 11.</p>\n<p>The rest of the team struggled including November’s Big West Golfer of the Month, Matthew Moomjian who would finish tied for 45th carding 25 over par for the tournament.</p>\n<p>“It is now my job to figure out to make sure Matt does not lose confidence,” Lass said. “Although Matt has accomplished some pretty good things in college golf thus far, he is still just a sophomore without much experience. As he matures he will continue getting better.”</p>\n<p>Freshman Kyle Maspat tied for 32nd with 20-over par while sophomore Brandon Bueno was 66th shooting 33-over par. On the bright side for Bueno, he earned a hole-in-one on the 10th hole in his first collegiate start.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos certainly are proud of a second-place finish, however, it is clear some more work needs to be done. Despite the difficulty of the course, carding 50-over par is not something UCSB wants to become a habit.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, Bauman and Swanson are continuing to improve off what was a great year for them in 2017, now the Gauchos need to solidify the other three slots.</p>\n<p>“The course was very difficult to play just because of the conditions and how windy it was,” Lass said. “So I understand shooting a high round but that does concern me and going forward we want to have all five guys playing really well and not just relying on a few.”</p>\n<p>By this point last season, Santa Barbara had already earned both a first and second place finish so the Gauchos aren’t far off. That being said, this year UCSB is the team with the target on their backs following their Big West Championship finish last season.</p>\n<p>“It’s always great to win and have some success,” Lass said. “And now at this point, I just want to find out top five players for the rest of year and hopefully things will pan out come Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be back in action at the John A. Burns Intercollegiate in Lihue, Kauai, Hawai’i taking place Feb. 15-17.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Santa Barbara lost by the following results: 25-23, 21-25, 19-25, and 23-25.</p>\n<p>Ranked No. 10 in the nation, Lewis University was coming off a four-game win streak, all of which occurred at home. Meanwhile, Saturday resulted in the Gauchos second-straight loss of their five-game road trip.</p>\n<p>In this matchup, the Gauchos were held to a .191 hitting percentage as compared to Lewis University’s .283. In terms of game leaders, All American sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders once again put up an outstanding performance as he led all players with 24 kills on the night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Compared to the Flyers’ leading outside hitter, sophomore Ryan Coenen’s total of 15 kills, it was a career high day for Sanders as his previous record was 14 kills in a single match.</p>\n<p>The first set had tensions high right away as both teams got off to booming starts. The match went back and forth as several lead changes turned into an eventual multi point lead for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it came down to Sanders’ kill production count of nine in just the first set and clutch ace serves that would go on to set up UCSB’s first set victory by a score of 25-23. Sanders averaged a second-highest hitting percentage for his side at .302, whilst redshirt junior middle blocker Connor Drake had a team leading .375.</p>\n<p>The host side then hit back hard as the Flyers opened the second set with a dominant 8-2 run. With help in the scoring category by Coenen’s .286 hitting percentage as well as redshirt junior opposite Mitch Perinar’s second most kill count of 12 total on .417 hitting, it proved enough for Lewis University to clinch the second set and tie the meet’s score count at 1-1.</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos wanted to reclaim the lead, they just never found themselves back in their first set form as they allowed another scoring drought to take place early on; which resulted in Lewis University’s third set victory.</p>\n<p>With only one set remaining and a victory needed in order to extend the match to a fifth set, the Gauchos gave it all they had left in the tank as they made the home side Flyers fight for every single point. In the end, it wasn’t enough for the Gauchos as the fourth and final set was dropped by another close score of 23-25.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will remain on the road as they head over to Provo, Utah to face off against No. 5 BYU at 6 p.m. on both Friday, Feb. 2, and Saturday, Feb. 3<sup>.</sup></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80662\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/no-14-gauchos-drop-second-straight-while-on-the-road-at-lewis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80662\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/no-14-gauchos-drop-second-straight-while-on-the-road-at-lewis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/no-14-gauchos-drop-second-straight-while-on-the-road-at-lewis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/no-14-gauchos-drop-second-straight-while-on-the-road-at-lewis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/no-14-gauchos-drop-second-straight-while-on-the-road-at-lewis/","id":4938,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[4937,4936,4935],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggle to Knock Off Unbeaten UC Davis on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Facing UC Davis for the second time in just over a week, the Gauchos dropped their second and final match against the Aggies much like the first.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79763\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2080556665\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80653\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79763\" data-attachment-id=\"79763\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/womens-basketball-to-host-seattle-in-home-opener/akilah-jennings-shoots-a-layup-and-draws-a-foul-stephen-mangadaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Akilah Jennings shoots a layup and draws a foul.

History seemed to repeat itself, as that was again the same story.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was heated, with both teams going blow for blow. In a quarter that was a fast-paced battle consisting of back-and-forth basketball, neither team led by more than four points.</p>\n<p>Looking at the scoreboard, it was 45-44 after the third – UCSB clinging on to their one-point advantage going into the last quarter of regulation.</p>\n<p>The visitors opened their last quarter with a subpar performance, scoring just three points over the first seven minutes. During that same time, UC Davis outscored their opponents 15-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos attempted to stomp their way back into the game to get the win, but ultimately their attempt was futile. The Aggies outscored UCSB 25-18 in the last quarter of regulation, solidifying their second win against Santa Barbara in just a few days.</p>\n<p>UCSB Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a monster game, leading all scorers with 25 points – equaling her career-high. Bates was on fire from long range, draining seven of twelve from downtown.</p>\n<p>The only other players scoring double digits for the visiting Gauchos were redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman who scored 13 points, and senior guard Makala Roper who notched 12 points of her own.</p>\n<p>Edelman had her fifth double-double of the season, seasoning 10 rebounds to go along with her 13 points. And Roper’s 12 points were scored as she came off the bench, and she impressively went four of five from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos who scored in double digits were seemingly the only gleaming spot for the visiting team, as the rest of the team went only went 4 for 27 from the field. The Aggies had four of their starters contribute double digits in the matchup, with redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch leading her team, scoring 16 points.</p>\n<p>Senior combo guard/forward Dani Nafekh came through in the clutch and made her presence known for the home team in the fourth quarter, splashing eight of her ten points in the final quarter.</p>\n<p>Nafekh drained two three-pointers in a crucial time of the game and gave the Aggies a five-point lead, getting them out of their late two-point deficit.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face another important battle, as they are set to go face-to-face with the Cal State Northridge Matadors at home in the Thunderdome on Wednesday, January 31, at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The game would ultimately go unfinished due to a Hurricane match victory.</p>\n<p>Perez-Somarriba’s match against UCSB senior Palina Duvabets was not so close. Duvabets struggled against the Hurricanes’ talented No. 1, losing both sets 6-1.</p>\n<p>While the match ended in a shutout, the Gauchos put up more of a fight than the final score might have indicated. Junior Stephanie Yamada, came the closest to securing a Gaucho victory, tying the Hurricanes’ sophomore Dominika Paterova and junior Daniella Roldan 5-5 in an unfinished doubles game, alongside her teammate, senior Amanda Atanasson.</p>\n<p>Yamada, who was named Big West Women’s Tennis Athlete of the Week last week, was equally competitive in the first set of her singles match against the Hurricane’s freshman Ulyana Shirokova. Despite a close first set, Yamada fell short in both sets against Shirokova, who handed Yamada her first official loss of the season, putting her at 5-1.</p>\n<p>Despite glimpses of balance between the two teams, the Hurricanes defeated the Gauchos handily and advanced to the final round of the tournament to face No. 16 Auburn University. The Hurricanes were subsequently defeated by the Tigers 2-4, leaving Miami 1-1 on the season and Auburn with an undefeated 5-0 record.</p>\n<p>Following their shutout on Saturday, the Gauchos bounced back against Tulane University on Sunday in the consolation round of the ITA Kick-off tournament. The Gauchos routed the Green Wave without much trouble, finishing the match with a score of 4-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ surge was led by their star seniors, Duvabets and Da Silveira, who combined for three wins and no losses against Tulane. The pair secured the first doubles victory of the day for their team, and Duvabets appeared to be unstoppable in her singles match against senior Sade Atkinson, winning both sets 6-1.</p>\n<p>After a rocky start against their first three opponents, UCSB freshmen Elizaveta Volodko and Lise Sentenac finally found their groove on Sunday against the Green Wave. Volodko earned her second singles win of the season against junior Elena Muller, and Sentenac was poised to win her first singles game of the season against freshman Daniela La Fuente until the game was ruled unfinished due to a match victory for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The pair also came close to securing their first doubles victory of the season, but it too was ruled unfinished after the Gauchos secured the doubles point.</p>\n<p>By routing the Green Wave in the consolation round, the Gauchos secured third place in the tournament behind two very talented and highly ranked teams. Both Tulane and UCSB finished the weekend with season records of 2-2.</p>\n<p>The unranked Gauchos have managed to compile an impressive season record considering the high concentration of ranked opponents that they have faced so far. Next weekend is not shaping up to be any easier, as the Gauchos will travel to Malibu on Friday to face No. 6 Pepperdine University, and then return home for a doubleheader on Saturday against USF and Kansas State.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos may not fill out the win column early in the season, their rigorous schedule will certainly leave them well prepared to face rivals in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match will be Friday, February 2nd at Pepperdine.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/womens-tennis-splits-ita-kick-off-weekend-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/womens-tennis-splits-ita-kick-off-weekend-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/womens-tennis-splits-ita-kick-off-weekend-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/womens-tennis-splits-ita-kick-off-weekend-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/womens-tennis-splits-ita-kick-off-weekend-tournament/","id":35,"author":{"id":55,"name":"Andrew Bishop"},"related":[34,33,32],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":38,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
