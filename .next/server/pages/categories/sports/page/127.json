For athletes good enough to play at the collegiate level, the dreams of performing in front of hundreds or thousands of fans and proving yourself not only to your school but to the entire country can finally be realized.</p>\n<p>After years of hard work, the true journey really begins at that point. For freshman goalkeeper Nikki Quinn of the UCSB women’s water polo team though, that moment was ruined at the worst time when she broke her arm on Christmas morning — less than a month before the start of the season.</p>\n<p>“I was pretty devastated,” Quinn said. “My immediate thought process was I never knew if I’d be able to play again. ”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The original diagnosis was that Quinn would be kept out for at least 10 weeks, but that didn’t stop her from continuing to take part in team activities.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t miss out on anything, even when I was on the side of the pool deck. For weeks I would go to practice, and I wasn’t allowed to touch a ball so I would just swim and do legs,” Quinn said. “I was just sitting there wanting to play, and in that month it made me realize how much I missed it.”</p>\n<p>The timing of her injury was made even worse due to the fact that Cathy Neushul, the coach who had recruited Quinn to UCSB, was replaced by current head coach Wolf Wigo in the offseason.</p>\n<p>“She mentioned to me in the beginning of summer that I would be the starting goalie, so that was a bummer,” Quinn said. “But I liked getting a new coach because it was a clean slate.”</p>\n<p>Quinn would have to wait to be able to prove herself though, as she worked herself back into game shape as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>She found inspiration wherever she could, whether it was from people telling her that she would never come back from the injury or from a famous athlete like recently-injured basketball star Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>As Quinn fought her way back from the injury, her work ethic and dedication to the team did not go unnoticed by her teammates. On a team full of young freshmen and sophomores, she found a way to stand out and make her presence felt despite being sidelined.</p>\n<p>“Nikki’s the type of person that goes above and beyond everything that she does,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “She didn’t want to miss anything; she wanted to still be involved in what the team was doing. She wants to get in with the team and do the extra amount of work even though she has a cast on.”</p>\n<p>After being sidelined for nearly four months and not playing in a competitive game since August, Quinn finally got her chance to play less than two weeks ago against the top team in the Big West: No. 5 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“The day before the game [Coach Wigo] asked me if I was ready to play, and I looked at him like ‘I’ve been ready. I want to play,’” Quinn said. “Mentally I was thinking, ‘I haven’t played in seven months, do I even know how to play?’ I was nervous, but after the first quarter I got back into the hang of it and it was fine.”</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for her to face her first test in a college game as the Anteaters found an opening early in the first quarter. However, what seemed to be an easy scoring opportunity from five meters turned out to be a remarkable first career save for Quinn.</p>\n<p>“In my mind that moment was a turning point, because a five-meter [shot] is an easy shot that should be made,” Martin said. “I can only imagine that it just boosts her confidence that much more. I think I speak for the whole team when I say that everyone was just really proud of her for holding her ground and doing what she needed to do.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the game, Quinn tallied a total of six saves and held Irvine, one of the most powerful offenses in the nation, to just six goals. Not too shabby for a freshman playing her first career game.</p>\n<p>“It definitely made me hopeful. I saw things in that game that I could’ve fixed,” Quinn said about her performance. “I think that’s what makes you a better player: when you think of all the mistakes you’ve done and how to fix them for the next game.”</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for Quinn to get her next chance to shine, as she was chosen to play the second half against No. 9 Cal State Northridge less than a week later. After finding herself in a tightly contested match that was clearly going down to the wire, Quinn stepped up in a big way.</p>\n<p>UCSB led by just one goal after sophomore utility Jessie Porter scored with under five minutes to go, and from then on the Matadors went into desperation mode looking for an equalizing goal.</p>\n<p>With just under a minute remaining, Quinn made an outstanding two-handed save right in front of a goal after a Northridge attacker fought herself free from a UCSB defender. The game wasn’t over yet though, and the Matadors were able to put together one more attack.</p>\n<p>Thanks to an untimely exclusion, the Gauchos found themselves playing 5-on-6 in the most crucial possession of the game, but Quinn came to the rescue once more.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 seconds remaining in the game, a Northridge attacker found herself wide open right in the middle of the UCSB defense. Her shot attempt to tie the game should have gone in easily, but Quinn made a one-handed save that was even more amazing than her previous one, preserving the win for Santa Barbara and making her unbeaten in her only two appearances.</p>\n<p>Despite her individual excellence, Quinn made it clear that she didn’t just have her own performance on her mind.</p>\n<p>“In the last couple minutes, you’re playing for your team,” Quinn said. “If you don’t block [those shots] then you’re letting them down.”</p>\n<p>While clutch plays are not expected to come from young players in their first games, Quinn’s mindset might be the most important reason why she’s been able to play so well under pressure in her few appearances thus far.</p>\n<p>“When the coach asks you which half you want to play, it’s like, ‘Do I want to set the tone in the first half or do I want to be in that situation where we’re down by one and need a stop?’” Quinn said, having personally asked to play in the second half rather than the first. “I like being the last one in the water.”</p>\n<p>Now, with the Big West Championships just a few days away, Quinn will have the opportunity to help her team win in its most important games of the season. Just as she has been all year though, she’s ready for the challenge, and her teammates are more than confident in her abilities to help them win.</p>\n<p>“If [Coach Wigo] picks Nikki then we all have the confidence in her,” Martin said. “You can see it in her eyes; she wants to win.”</p>\n<p>When Quinn hops in the pool this weekend, it’s going to be a tough test no matter who she’s facing. For her though, this entire year has been as tough a test as she has faced since she started playing water polo at the age of 11.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how it turns out this weekend, one thing is for sure: UCSB will have a bright future with Quinn in the cage for the next three years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Nikki Quinn.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54951\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54951\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/","id":5083,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5082,5081,5080],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From Australia to America","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/womens-tennis-kenneth-song.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/womens-tennis-kenneth-song.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Coming From Australia, Freshman Jaimee Gilbertson Battled Injury but Has Excelled at UCSB","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For a standard tennis player, the game involves obstacles that may be arduous, yet are necessary to overcome in order to excel in the sport. For UCSB freshman Jaimee Gilbertson, these obstacles included traveling from her hometown of Noosa, Australia and adopting to an entirely new culture and lifestyle all at the age of 17.</p>\n<p>Gilbertson began competing in the sport of tennis at a very young age and by the time she was in high school, she had been excelling far above her fellow opponents.</p>\n<p>“There is no competitive play in high school and no high school teams, so to play you have to be on a completely separate club or team outside of school,” Gilbertson said. “Coming here and actually playing on a team at school is very different. You play not only for yourself but for your teammates and your school. It’s a lot of responsibility because you have to rely on your teammates while they rely on you, and it builds a very strong team connection.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Gilbertson has an impressive resumé from her play in Australia as well. She has won six national titles in singles, doubles and team events. She holds 11 Australian Tournament titles as well as 36 Optus junior titles and was the captain of her tennis team in 2012 and 2013. So when high school ended for Gilbertson, she knew she had a bright future in the sport of tennis ahead of her.</p>\n<p>“I traveled to Texas, Memphis and Florida, but my decision to come to UCSB really came down to the coach,” Gilbertson said. “Coach Thibodeau was recommended by the coaches back home for his previous experience and success at Fresno State. So when I came to visit UCSB, I knew that he knew what he was talking about. He explained to me that he had a team that was really starting over and that he wanted a team that he could build and take to the next level for NCAA competition.”</p>\n<p>In the first half of her season, Gilbertson was sidelined by an injury and eventual surgery to her hand. The recovery for Gilbertson took much of the first half of the season. However, once Gilbertson was healthy, she swiftly regained her power and used the sheer knowledge of the game that she had championed so fiercely earlier in her career.</p>\n<p>Winning her first couple matches back from surgery has been considered the most memorable moment of Gilbertson’s first year playing for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Although feelings of homesickness and the immersion into a new country over 7,000 miles away from her homeland, Gilbertson has continued to be superior in her abilities on the court. In the past two matches, Gilbertson has been placed at the first singles position and won both matches against opponents UC Riverside and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>With Gilbertson only in her first year, the 17 year old looks to be an extensive bright spot for UCSB in years to come.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of April 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54953\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/from-australia-to-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54953\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/from-australia-to-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/from-australia-to-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/from-australia-to-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/from-australia-to-america/","id":171,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[170,169,168],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dangerous Dane","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UCSB-tennis-vs-Nevada_02.25.2014-upload_Kenneth-Song-5031.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UCSB-tennis-vs-Nevada_02.25.2014-upload_Kenneth-Song-5031.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Junior Tobias Galskov Has Ascended Quickly to No. 1 on the UCSB Men’s Tennis Team","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Denmark may not be known internationally for its great tennis players, but out of the Scandinavian country came Tobias Galskov, the No. 1 tennis player on the UCSB men’s tennis team.</p>\n<p>Galskov followed his fellow Danes to UCSB and he could not be happier with his decision of where to play Division I tennis.

The youngest of four kids, he had watched his two older brothers and sister play the sport he now loves and wanted to give it a try. After playing tennis and soccer for a few years he chose to focus on tennis when he was eight. He then began playing at an academy after school when he was 10 and continued to do so in high school while also competing in national tournaments.</p>\n<p>“I was always the number one player in my age group in Denmark and I began traveling with the national team near the end of high school,” Galskov said. “I went to the European Championships and a lot of national tournaments which took up a lot of time.”</p>\n<p>When thinking about what he wanted to do after high school, Galskov always knew he wanted tennis to be an integral part of it. He began writing to coaches in the United States hoping to hear responses back from them. He eventually settled for Foothill Community College in Northern California. Galskov also did all of this future life-planning without his parents’ knowledge.</p>\n<p>“My parents have always been very supportive. My dad has watched a lot of tennis over the years and has sort of become my ‘mental coach,’” Galskov said. “My parents didn’t know much about my plan for college. I wrote all the letters myself, and I think after everything they were quite impressed with how I organized everything.”</p>\n<p>The two years at Foothill were not much of a challenge for Galskov. He commented on the easy practices and that even though he played No. 1 most of the matches, he did not give up a game. After his first year, he was ranked No. 1 in the nation for singles and No. 4 for doubles in the community college rankings. Galskov decided after his first year at Foothill that he would spend his second year of junior college back home in Denmark practicing harder and taking online courses. He then started the process of writing letters to coaches again, and this time UCSB wanted him for the team.</p>\n<p>“The transition to UCSB hasn’t been that hard actually,” Galskov said. “We had the quarter system [at Foothill] and the academics were good up there. Here the practices are longer and much harder.”</p>\n<p>Galskov is enjoying his time at UCSB, living near the beach and having long summers. He enjoys all the choices for food but says that some of them are not as good as back home. Galskov also loves the laid-back lifestyle of the people and how friendly everyone is.</p>\n<p>When looking towards the future, Galskov, a third-year global studies major, is unsure but optimistic about where he will end up. A lot of his decisions depend on how much he improves on the tennis court in the next year.</p>\n<p>“If I keep improving, I might want to try to play professionally after college,” Galskov said. “If not, then I will probably go back to Denmark and go to graduate school because it’s free there, so that’s a good opportunity. But maybe I will travel with friends and try to play professionally in Europe. It all depends on this next year of improvement.”</p>\n<p>When looking at this year of tennis where Galskov has moved up in the ranks of the Gaucho tennis team to secure the No. 1 singles spot and No. 1 doubles spot with his partner, junior Ziad Sultan, this is exactly where he had planned to be and he has definitely impressed his coaches.</p>\n<p>“Tobias has far exceeded my expectations this year,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “He made a quantum leap of tennis levels in the fall and it has made him such a better player. We didn’t see him as our number one starting the year, but now he has that top spot secured down.”</p>\n<p>Galskov has led the Gauchos this year with 14 dual-match victories and hopes to lead UCSB to a Big West Conference Championship and to secure a birth in the NCAA tournament this upcoming weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of April 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/","id":172,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[171,170,169],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast CSUN in Regular Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 15 UCSB secured the fifth seed in next week's conference tournament with a victory over Northridge this past weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final game of the regular season, the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team took down No. 9 Cal State Northridge in a tightly contested match that went down to the wire.

Sophomore attacker Miranda Schrader held the ball up high on the right side and picked out her spot before firing one past the keeper to cut the deficit to one. Freshman attacker Brenna Thomas followed that up on the next possession with a deep shot from the left side to tie the game at 4-4.</p>\n<p>“When you get down by one or two goals you really have to shift gears and just fight from that point on,” Quinn said. “We did a really good job at going out there, controlling the game and staying up by one the entire time.”</p>\n<p>In the third quarter, junior utility Lauren Martin took advantage of Northridge on the inside with two strong goals in front of the net. Another goal from freshman attacker Carly Christian gave UCSB three for the quarter, but CSUN had an answer every time.</p>\n<p>“We made a couple of small adjustments, but that was just sort of how the game was going,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “There wasn’t necessarily one turning point in the game; we clawed back, got a couple goals, played solid defense and held on from there.”</p>\n<p>The biggest adjustment for the Gauchos came in the form of Quinn, who subbed in for the second half. The freshman had played in one game all year before this one, but she made her presence felt in the final period.</p>\n<p>Northridge senior attacker Lindsy Duncan scored on a deep lob shot to tie it once again at 7-7 with fewer than six minutes to go, subsequently setting up a thrilling finish.</p>\n<p>With 4:30 left in the game, the Gauchos took advantage of a 6-on-5 situation with Porter just getting a shot to go despite the keeper getting a hand to it, giving them the lead once again.</p>\n<p>From this point on, every desperate attempt to tie the game was smothered by the UCSB defense and Quinn, who had three big saves late, including an outstanding point-blank stop with just 50 seconds remaining. Northridge was unable to find a shot in the final minute as the Gauchos held on for the win.</p>\n<p>No. 5 seed UCSB will play No. 4 seed Long Beach State this Friday at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/","id":5100,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5099,5098,5097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Two of Three in Series at UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-04-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-04-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB continued its recent run of success, taking two out of three from UC Davis while winning seven of the last eight games.

Then, with the bases loaded, sophomore shortstop Christa Castello tripled to score the winning runs for the struggling Aggies.</p>\n<p>UCSB had opportunities to earn the series sweep in the fifth and sixth innings, but could not find the winning hit, leaving two runners on base in each inning.</p>\n<p>Despite sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore’s effort, being involved in every run for Santa Barbara hitting 2-3 with two RBI, the rest of the team could muster up just one run.</p>\n<p>For UCD, sophomore designated hitter Kelly Zboralske did her job, hitting 2-3 with two RBI in her team’s win. Overall on Friday, Zboralske tallied one run and three RBI on 4-6 hitting.</p>\n<p>After spending the last two weekends on the road, the Gauchos return home to Campus Diamond next weekend for a three-game series against Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/","id":1059,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1058,1057,1056],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Rival Cal Poly in Regular Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7784.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7784.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos dropped their regular season finale to rival Cal Poly, setting UCSB up with the No. 3 seed in next week's Big West Tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team will enter the Big West Tournament next weekend as the No. 3 seed after losing to Cal Poly 4-3 in Saturday afternoon’s season finale.

At No. 3 doubles, freshman Ben Donovan and senior Jurgen De Jager of Cal Poly beat freshman Teague Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton 8-6.</p>\n<p>“There was definitely a lot of tension on the courts today,” Sultan said. “The fans backed their team and helped them get a good start in the doubles matches, but from there I don’t think the crowd affected our team much.”</p>\n<p>In singles Sultan held his own, playing at No. 1 for the first time in months in Galskov’s absence. He defeated Donovan in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7-2). Following suit were Hamilton, who defeated freshman Corey Pang 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), and freshman Erik Johnsson, who beat De Jager 3-6, 7-6, 3-0 (retired). Hamilton’s win was his 14th of the season, tying him with Galskov for the most singles wins in this dual-match season.</p>\n<p>“Watching Teague and Erik battle for their three-set victories was awesome,” Sultan said. “I think our team fitness showed off in those matches. Teague had a tough match and I was really impressed. And Erik played really well so it was great to see him pull out the victory.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played especially well considering they all had to move up one spot in the lineup to play higher positions against different players than they had initially prepared for. Galskov’s sickness also saw Riminton’s insertion into the singles lineup at No. 6 but he fell to junior Naveen Beasley 6-2, 6-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB now looks towards next weekend’s conference tournament. Entering as the No. 3 seed, the Gauchos play bottom seed UC Riverside on Thursday. The Highlanders are 2-21 overall and 0-5 in conference this season, and the Gauchos defeated UCR 7-0 when they played earlier this season. A win over UC Riverside would set up a rematch against Cal Poly in the second round. Last season, the Gauchos won the conference tournament coming in as the No. 5 seed.</p>\n<p>“I think we are fitter than Cal Poly, and next week at Indian Wells could be a different story in the high heat and in a neutral environment,” Sultan said. “I think we can beat this team if we play them next weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has one week to prepare for the biggest weekend of tennis so far this year. The Gauchos plan to continue working on fitness, defensive play and finishing matches better as they prepare to defend their conference tournament title.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins Big West Tournament play at 9 a.m. Thursday, Apr. 24 at Indian Wells, CA.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/","id":804,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[803,802,801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Series to Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB dropped two of three games in this past weekend's series at Long Beach State.

Bieber tossed eight innings of four-hit ball and struck out eight batters to limit the Dirtbags to just one run.</p>\n<p>“That was the best I’ve ever seen [Bieber],” junior pitcher Austin Pettibone said. “He was kind of in the zone with his fastball. His slider was pretty filthy. That’s all you want to do — to be able to get deep into the game.”</p>\n<p>His outing set the stage for sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate to collect his ninth save of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game’s deadlock on a RBI groundout by sophomore utility player Robby Nesovic in the third inning to go up 1-0. Santa Barbara manufactured another run in the following inning on a fly out, after a sacrifice bunt advanced a runner to third base.</p>\n<p>Much of the game from there on consisted of each team’s pitching retiring the others’ bats. Bieber’s lone blemish came in the fifth inning when he allowed a runner to score on a fielder’s choice.</p>\n<p>Bieber was near perfect on the day, needing only 93 pitches for the win and lowering his ERA to 2.89.</p>\n<p>Bieber’s outing came the day before when Long Beach’s senior pitcher Josh Frye shutout the Gauchos in a tight 1-0 decision. Frye canceled out Pettibone’s own impressive efforts. The two starters were locked in a pitcher’s duel with Pettibone exiting after six innings with one run allowed.</p>\n<p>After Long Beach capitalized on two hits in the first inning to score the game’s only run, Pettibone seemed in for a long outing similar to his last start, but the right-hander settled down from there on.</p>\n<p>“It felt good to throw well again; I’ve been struggling these past couple weeks against Cal Poly and Fullerton,” Pettibone said. “I gave up an earned run which ended up hurting us, but overall I had a competitive outing.”</p>\n<p>Frye went the distance to improve to 3-0 on the season. Long Beach has now won Frye’s last four starts as the senior has given up only one run in his last 27 innings thrown.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s only threat came by way of junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who was the only Gaucho to get past first base.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s five-run game was the highest scoring game of the series. Mounting a two-run rally in the ninth, the Gauchos’ comeback attempt fell short in the bottom half of the inning on a walk-off hit by the Dirtbags.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s sophomore pitcher Andrew Rohrbach kept hitters guessing for eight innings and did not rattle until the ninth. Kuresa doubled to force a change, and junior Kyle Friedrichs came in for the save.</p>\n<p>Friedrichs, however, gave up a walk and was victim to an infield error that brought in the runner from second. Freshman DH Billy Fredrick then stepped up to the plate and delivered the game-tying hit to nod the score at 2-2 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Long Beach got the bottom half of the inning started with a single off junior Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has been a workhorse and reliable relief pitcher for the Gauchos, retired the next batter before giving up the game-winning double for the 3-2 loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts UCR beginning Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of </em><em>April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/","id":4713,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4712,4711,4710],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats UCLA in MPSF Quarterfinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VBall_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VBall_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara defeated No. 5 seed UCLA and will next take on No. 1 seed BYU in the MPSF Semifinals.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Down 12-6 in the fourth set against UCLA, it seemed the Gauchos’ prosperous season was coming to a dead end.

UCLA took the first, but UCSB rebounded defeating the Bruins 25-20 in the second. Senior opposite Evan Licht opened the second set on the right foot, pounding a kill to take the first point. A strong offensive push from Licht in combination with back-to-back UCLA attack errors were exactly what the Gauchos needed after coming out flat. Licht led the Gauchos with 17 kills on the night.</p>\n<p>The third set shifted back and resulted in another UCLA win at 25-18. The Gauchos fell behind early in the set 8-7 and were unable to regain the lead afterwards. UCLA’s senior outside hitter Gonzalo Quiroga turned up the UCLA offense, ending the night with a team-high 18 kills.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was the game changer for UCSB. Down 12-6 to the Bruins, Coach McLaughlin called a timeout that would change the course of the game.</p>\n<p>“That fourth game was all heart: It was six guys with a will to win,” Hanley said. “There is no way we could have done it without every single guy out there.”</p>\n<p>A combined block from sophomore setter Jonah Seif and junior middle blocker Jake Staahl, and a solo block from senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson walled the UCLA attack, giving the Gauchos the taste of momentum they needed. An attack error from UCLA’s senior opposite Spencer Rowe tied the game at 17-17. Hanley and redshirt junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen took control over the set with two kills apiece, ending the set in a 25-20 UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>A close fifth set marked by six different tied scores sealed the UCSB comeback. Licht started the UCSB rhythm with a service ace that led to a four-point run. A suiting finish to the UCSB and UCLA matchup, Hanley contributed to the last two points of the game that would secure a 15-12 victory over his former team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue their MPSF playoff run on Thursday in a match against BYU. Thursday’s match is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. and will be televised on BYU TV.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-defeats-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-defeats-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-defeats-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-defeats-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-defeats-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/","id":5240,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5239,5238,5237],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 4 Seed UCSB Hosts No. 5 UCLA in MPSF Quarterfinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2.12.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.v.CSUN-6_vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2.12.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.v.CSUN-6_vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts UCLA in the first round of the MPSF playoffs this Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This Saturday is destined to be the ultimate blue and gold showdown.

This win bumped the Bruins up a place in the MPSF standings, allowing them to swap places with UC Irvine for the fifth place finish. UCLA closed out its season with a conference record of 15-9, just one game separating them from UCSB.</p>\n<p>After last week’s overwhelming attendance at UCSB’s senior game, the Gauchos are sure to have the crowd working to their advantage in Saturday night’s matchup. Building from the momentum of having home court advantage, UCSB will also need to demonstrate strong, consistent serving and passing in order to maintain an edge over the Bruins.</p>\n<p>“UCLA is a good team, I think we match up well with them and it’s going to come down to us winning the serve and pass,” senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson said.</p>\n<p>In last week’s game, sophomore setter Jonah Seif and senior opposite Evan Licht both delivered from the service line. Seif and Licht were each responsible for three services aces, contributing to UCSB’s eight total. Licht also helped the offensive rhythm in terms of passing. He finished the night with a double-double, recording 10 digs and 10 kills.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, the Gauchos seem to be less concerned with their opponent, but more focused on maintaining their own level of play.</p>\n<p>“We are going to play our game, it doesn’t matter who is across the net,” Licht said. “If we serve and pass the ball like we did against BYU, we are going to be hard to beat.”</p>\n<p>Shifting the attention to the Bruins, UCLA will enter Santa Barbara with a three-game win streak fueling its momentum. Players to watch out for are senior outside hitters Gonzalo Quiroga and Robart Page. Both players are leading UCLA’s offensive attack, recording over 350 kills apiece on the season.</p>\n<p>Looking back at the Gaucho and Bruin series for the 2014 season, both teams are even with one win each.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to take what we just did against BYU,” junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen said. “Taking care of our side of the net and hitting our serve well. We can beat anyone and we know that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts the MPSF tournament quarterfinals this Saturday at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-4-seed-ucsb-hosts-no-5-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-4-seed-ucsb-hosts-no-5-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-4-seed-ucsb-hosts-no-5-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-4-seed-ucsb-hosts-no-5-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-4-seed-ucsb-hosts-no-5-ucla-in-mpsf-quarterfinals/","id":5239,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5238,5237,5236],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head to Big West Tournament as No. 5 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/W1-Tennis-v-Hawaii_03.24.2014_Kenneth-Song-6997.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/W1-Tennis-v-Hawaii_03.24.2014_Kenneth-Song-6997.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will try to put it all together at the Big West Tournament this weekend after a somewhat difficult season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the regular season at a close, the UCSB women’s tennis team looks to head to Indian Wells for the Big West Tournament, where the Gauchos are the fifth seed.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara heads into the Big West Tournament with an overall record of 7-14 with a 4-3 mark in conference play. The season began slowly for the Gauchos, mainly because they were dealing with numerous injuries and were in the process of producing their finest lineup through weekly changes at the first and second singles spot. The Gauchos dealt with multiple losing streaks in the first half of the season, including a five-game skid spanning from February 2-22.</p>\n<p>The second half of the season involved a large transformation for Santa Barbara, especially in the case of productivity. With improved offense and a healthier squad, the Gauchos turned their season around with convincing team wins against robust opponents such as Sacramento State and Cal State Northridge.

It’s not just fatigue; many girls have previously cramped or gotten sick in the heat, so I think this preparation will give us a bit of an upper hand when it comes to the conditions near Palms Springs this time of year,” Meehan said.</p>\n<p>With the fifth seed in the Big West Tournament, the Gauchos are set to meet UC Davis in the first round. UC Davis has had a year somewhat similar to the Gauchos in terms of conference play with a 4-3 record. Yet, the Aggies have a much better overall record at 12-8 on the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need the continued support of their strong team. Players like junior April Scatliffe and sophomore Priscila Garcia have been huge benefactors to the Gauchos in singles play. New additions to the team in freshmen Kaiulani Boyer and Jaimee Gilbertson have too supplied the extra willpower needed by UCSB to gain crucial wins.</p>\n<p>Although UC Davis is a seed above Santa Barbara, UCSB should feel good about the matchup. In their only regular season meeting, Santa Barbara toppled the Aggies at home 6-1. If the Gauchos continue to play like they have in previous weeks, a win against UC Davis will not be far out of reach. In terms of the first round, the Gauchos should hope that history does indeed repeat itself.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Tournament is set to begin on Thursday, April 24 in Indian Wells.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-head-to-big-west-tournament-as-no-5-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-head-to-big-west-tournament-as-no-5-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-head-to-big-west-tournament-as-no-5-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-head-to-big-west-tournament-as-no-5-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-head-to-big-west-tournament-as-no-5-seed/","id":786,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[785,784,783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Close Regular Season Against Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7536.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7536.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will compete in its final regular season match of the year this weekend against rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Big West title run continues on Saturday for the UCSB men’s tennis team as the Gauchos take on Cal Poly in a battle between conference rivals, which could have a large impact on both teams’ seeding in the upcoming end-of-the-season Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the match with an 8-12 overall record, yet are undefeated in conference play at 3-0.

Galskov and Sultan are 7-2 this season playing together in doubles, and this change in partnerships has seen the Gauchos win the doubles point on many more occasions since the switch in the lineup.</p>\n<p>“Our doubles play has gotten progressively better over the course of the season,” Davis said. “Having our top two guys playing at No. 1 gives us a lot of confidence to win the top doubles match and thus secure the doubles point.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s No. 3 doubles team made up of freshman Teague Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton has also impressed this season, as together, the two lower-classmen have won 10 matches together.</p>\n<p>“I expect Cal Poly to play really hard in doubles,” Davis said. “They play aggressive, and I will be really pleased to get the doubles point this weekend.”</p>\n<p>In singles, Galskov will lead the Gauchos playing at No. 1 with his team-leading 14 dual match victories. Following right behind him will be Sultan, who has won his last two matches and nine overall. Near the bottom of the lineup, the Gauchos can expect a strong performance from Hamilton, playing at No. 5, who has won 14 matches this season.</p>\n<p>“Our team is hungry for victory this weekend,” Davis said. “The guys know what is at stake, and they are looking forward to this important match.”</p>\n<p>Looking at Cal Poly’s lineup, the Mustangs will be led by freshman Ben Donovan at the No. 1 spot. Donovan won the Big West Men’s Tennis Athlete of the Week on Wednesday after enjoying a week where he won two matches, one over freshman Alec Adamson of UC Davis 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, and another against Stanford as he defeated senior Daniel Ho 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p>Following Donovan in the lineup will be senior Marco Comuzzo at the No. 2 position with his eight dual match wins this season and senior Jurgen De Jager and his 10-1 record from the No. 3 position. The team’s top doubles team will consist of Comuzzo and senior Matt Thompson as together they lead the team with eight doubles victories.</p>\n<p>“I expect it to be a circus up at Cal Poly on Saturday,” Davis said. “The hostile environment will be both fun and challenging. I want our guys to get on the court and let the scoreboard do the talking.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will leave Santa Barbara on Friday in order to get some practice on the Cal Poly courts and to mentally prepare for what will surely be a difficult environment to play in against UCSB’s rival school. The match begins at 1 p.m. as the Gauchos hope to silence the crowds with their play on the courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/","id":801,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[800,799,798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces Struggling UC Davis in Weekend Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/4.6.14UCSBSoftballvCalPoly-11_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/4.6.14UCSBSoftballvCalPoly-11_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will look to expand upon its five-game win streak with a three-game series at UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On paper, this weekend’s series should be an easy one for the UCSB softball team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos make the long road trip north to face a UC Davis team that has struggled all year at 14-25 overall and 3-6 in the Big West.

Davis’ best pitcher is freshman Andrea Reynolds, who ranks seventh in conference in ERA at 3.25, just one spot behind Wisdom.</p>\n<p>“It’s the Big West Conference and our coach always tells us that the Big West is a roller coaster,” Wisdom said. “Teams have great days and then will have their worst days. Whatever day they bring us, we’ll have our best day.”</p>\n<p>Reynolds will face a Gaucho team that loves to score frequently. Led by senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil, UCSB tallied 22 runs last weekend. Pilpil couldn’t be stopped offensively, recording four doubles, five runs and three RBI on 6-10 hitting. Her effort led to Big West Field Player of the Week honors earlier this week.</p>\n<p>“[Pilpil] did really well defensively and offensively,” Wisdom said. “The whole team played well. Once we put the bat to the ball and started hitting holes, it got contagious and we couldn’t stop hitting.”</p>\n<p>Along with freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark, the duo rank among the top seven in the Big West in runs.

Last weekend she pitched every inning in the sweep, earning three wins to increase her record to 13-10.</p>\n<p>“It’s the same focus as last weekend — getting our bunts down, moving runners and playing strong defense,” Wisdom said.</p>\n<p>The series will begin tomorrow with a double-header and conclude Saturday.

[Northridge is] kind of a mystery to us right now, so we’re basically focusing on the fact that if we play our game the best that we can then everything’s going to be okay.”</p>\n<p>Defense is going to be the key for UCSB as it has to take on the conference’s top scorer in junior center Marisa Young. In just 29 games, Young has put up an astounding mark of 60 goals. No other player has hit even the 50-goal mark in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“We’re really focusing on fine-tuning what we need to work on,” Hudson said. “We’re focusing on getting our defense really quick and on-point and everyone on the same page. I think it’s going to be a battle of defense this weekend for sure.”</p>\n<p>As they look to end their recent three-game skid, the Gauchos will also have their hands full trying to contain attacker Lindsy Duncan. The senior has accumulated one of the highest goal scoring tallies in the conference with 47 while also leading her team in assists with 43.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played some really strong teams lately and I don’t think we’ve been performing poorly, necessarily. It’s just that we’ve been playing really strong competitors,” sophomore utility Holly Smith said. “We’ve played well, but we just need to take it to the next level in order to beat teams like Northridge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had won five straight games before losing its last three conference games, two of which were at home. However, with those losses coming by an average of less than three goals per game, the Gauchos know that they are on the right track heading towards the season’s finale.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better every single game,” Hudson said. “It’s not reflecting that in our record right now, but we’re also playing much higher ranked teams than in the beginning. If you look at the scores in the games we’ve lost, we’re actually playing teams a lot closer than in the beginning of the year.”</p>\n<p>One of the main issues for Santa Barbara from the beginning of the season was its inexperience due to a large number of freshmen and sophomores. Though talented, it has yet to be seen if that talent can outweigh the experience of some of the other teams in the conference heading into the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>“I think what’s missing right now is that little extra something to win a game when we’re tied or down by one with a minute left,” Hudson said. “Not many of us have that experience at this high level to really put a team away and finish a game strong. I think that’s definitely what we need to work on, and if we can do that then I think that the Big West tournament and the game against Northridge will go really well for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on the Matadors this Friday at 4 p.m. at Campus Pool for their final home match of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/","id":5099,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5098,5097,5096],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 14 UCSB Hits the Road to Face Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will look to continue its strong play against Long Beach State after winning last week's series against Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off three wins in its past four games, the No. 14 UCSB baseball team eyes its first conference series win on the road starting tonight against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game 23-8 overall and 4-5 in the Big West after Monday’s nonconference victory against BYU.

Hopefully the way we’ve been playing continues to reward us this weekend at Long Beach.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach State presents a different challenge for Santa Barbara. The Dirtbags have won three of their last seven series and enter 16-18 overall and 3-3 in league.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s winning formula has been pitching and defense. Senior pitcher Josh Frye has been the ace of the staff and pitches the second game of the series. The right-hander has started the last three weeks and the team has gone 3-0 in each of his appearances. Frye has been nearly unhittable, allowing just a run in his last 16 innings and five hits combined during his last two starts.</p>\n<p>Just as unhittable has been junior closer Kyle Friedrichs. In six save opportunities, the closer has converted all of them without giving up a run or walk, with just two hits. Opposing batters are hitting a mere .105 against him.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s efficiency on defense is shown in its .980 fielding percentage, the eighth highest in the country. In total, the Dirtbags have committed just 27 errors this season.</p>\n<p>Although not as reputable as Cal State Fullerton, UCSB learned how tough the Big West is earlier in the season when it lost its series against Hawaii University and will be careful not to repeat its mistake.</p>\n<p>“When you have a good year, you have a target on your back,” Epperson said. “I wouldn’t expect Long Beach to be any different. We’re preparing just like we prepared for Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have consistently been able to put up runs on the scoreboard. Statistically, Santa Barbara is top in the league in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and homeruns.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s offensive statistics are a testament to the team’s potent lineup, no hitter in the country this year has been seeing the ball as clear as Epperson.</p>\n<p>Epperson leads the nation with a .451 batting average and his numbers have been recognized with him being added to the Midseason “Golden Spikes Award” Watch List — the award given to the top amateur player in the country. His most underrated aspect, however, has been his versatility to hit anywhere in the batting order, from leadoff to the cleanup spot.</p>\n<p>“There’s really not a lot of pressure on each individual offensively, and I certainly feel that way,” Epperson said. “I’m really comfortable on the leadoff spot and I’ll hit wherever, and I kind of feel like I’m just going to go for it and do whatever I can to help the team win.”</p>\n<p>Just as dominant as Epperson, has been the UCSB bullpen. When leading after six innings, Santa Barbara is 17-0 with much of the credit going to sophomore closer Dillon Tate and his eight saves on the season, second overall in conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send sophomore Justin Jacome and junior Austin Pettibone for games one and two, respectively. Saturday’s starter is yet to be announced.</p>\n<p>First pitch tonight is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54887\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54887\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/","id":4711,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4710,4709,4708],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 5 UCSB Clinches Home Playoff Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VolleyballCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VolleyballCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 5 Gauchos defeated No. 3 BYU on senior night.

Senior opposite Evan Licht, redshirt junior Weston Nielsen and senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson were all responsible for multiple kills early in the first set. Adding to the early offensive momentum, sophomore setter Jonah Seif had two back-to-back service aces.</p>\n<p>Despite taking the lead early on, multiple UCSB attack errors and a quick turnaround from BYU’s lead offensive player, senior outside hitter Taylor Sander, resulted in a tie game at 15-15. BYU took the first set with a 24-21 victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s our bad. You should never give up a lead like we had,” McLaughlin said. “But our guys stuck with it; they didn’t let it phase them for the next three games, which is a great thing to see.”</p>\n<p>In the second set, the Gauchos came out with vengeance, again taking an early 12-5 lead over the Cougars. Back-to-back kills from Nielsen and multiple BYU attack errors were the recipe to success in the second set. The Gauchos recorded an impressive .400 hitting clip in this set, holding BYU to an abnormally low .071. UCSB took the second game with a dominant 25-15 finish.</p>\n<p>“We got caught up in the swing of things and they fired back,” senior opposite Evan Licht said. “They have some good serving, but we really settled in after game one.”</p>\n<p>In the third and fourth sets, the teams demonstrated a more even exchange of points. With a tie game at 10-10 in the third, an attack error from BYU’s Sander gave the Gauchos the edge they needed to claim the lead. Senior outside hitter Matt Hanley stepped up for the Gauchos offensively and Licht contributed with a key service ace. UCSB won the third set 28-26.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors were so fired up for this,” Nielsen said. “The crowd was amazing. It was probably the most people I have seen in here in a long, long time.”</p>\n<p>A crowd of over 1,800 fans cheered on the Gauchos as they headed into a very important fourth set. BYU jumped out ahead with the first two points, but a kill from Nielsen and another service ace from Licht would make it even at 2-2. The Gauchos finally took the lead at 15-14, and maintained it for most of the set with BYU on their heels. An attack error late in the game from UCSB’s Hanley gave away the lead at 25-26. A combination of a Seif kill and two BYU attack errors ended the game in UCSB’s favor. The Gauchos pulled away in the final set with a 28-26 victory.</p>\n<p>“If that’s a peak, that is a pretty good peak right there,” Nielsen said. “If we can have all seven guys playing like that throughout the postseason, we know we will do big things.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will host the UCLA Bruins in the first round of MPSF playoffs this Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54828\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-5-ucsb-clinches-home-playoff-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54828\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-5-ucsb-clinches-home-playoff-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-5-ucsb-clinches-home-playoff-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-5-ucsb-clinches-home-playoff-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-5-ucsb-clinches-home-playoff-game/","id":5238,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5237,5236,5235],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":127,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
