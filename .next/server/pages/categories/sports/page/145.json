Following sophomore defender Marshall Cazares’ pair of yellow cards in the 53rd minute, the Gauchos were left one man down.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage did not stop UCSB, however, as junior forward Reed McKenna notched the game at 1-1 with a 62nd minute goal that flew between the goalkeeper and the left post for his first career goal. Freshman midfielder Drew Murphy contributed on the play for his team-leading sixth assist on the season.</p>\n<p>“We never give up and even people that aren’t used to stepping up stepped up today,” Campion said.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless rest of the second half and first overtime, the Gauchos received another goal from an even more unlikely source in junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez. Garcia-Lopez received the ball on the other side of the field and dribbled all the way to the goal, sending a shot inside the right post for the golden goal.</p>\n<p>Irvine fell to 7-4-2 on the season and 2-2 in conference, defeating Cal Poly 2-0 on Friday night before facing UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Today was as improbable as it gets. We had a defender pick up a ball 70 yards away from goal and score,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Literally in all my years in soccer I don’t know if I can recall a play like that, it was really unbelievable.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s contest proved to be equally dramatic as the Gauchos faced the highest ranked opponent they have faced all season in No. 4 Northridge.</p>\n<p>UCSB fell behind 1-0 before defender Peter Schmetz recorded his third goal of the season with little time to spare in the 87th minute. Murphy assisted on the goal for his fifth of the season.</p>\n<p>Campion then gave UCSB an important victory over a ranked opponent with a successful penalty kick in the 100th minute. Northridge raised its record to 11-2 and 3-1 in the Big West after defeating Cal Poly Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We played two really tough games against two good teams on the road,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we played fairly well on Friday night and it was great that we were able to win. The game tonight we didn’t play well at all but again still found a way to win. Everyone’s pretty proud of where things are right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces UC Davis on Saturday for a 3 p.m. start. The Gauchos hold a two-game advantage over second place Davis in the Big West North.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 14, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em></em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/","id":1606,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1605,1604,1603],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeat No. 3 Hawaii on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W_VBall_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W_VBall_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Hawaii for the first time since 1994.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team headed into a road game against No. 3 Hawaii with loads of confidence and the belief that they could compete with any team in the country.

The Gauchos stayed strong and eventually won the set at 25-20, after a Hawaii service error.</p>\n<p>The second set began even better than the first for UCSB as it took advantage of several Hawaii errors on the way to a 6-1 lead. Later in the set, a kill by senior opposite Katey Thompson made it 14-6, the largest lead of the night for either team.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine fought back, eventually making it a 21-19 game after an attacking error by Thompson. The Gauchos answered back though, by scoring four of the next five points to win the set 25-20 and take a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started off the third set strong after three straight Hawaii attacking errors, including two blocks from Thompson, gave UCSB a 5-3 lead. However, plagued by service and attacking errors, UCSB found itself facing a 20-13 deficit. Senior outside hitter Emily Hartong put it away for Hawaii with a kill to win the set 25-21 and cut the Gauchos lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>Hartong was the only Rainbow Wahine player in double digits in kills on from the night with 20.</p>\n<p>Hawaii took its momentum into the fourth set as they took an early 7-2 lead. Both teams traded runs throughout, but the Rainbow Wahine ended up prevailing 25-22 after a second straight set-winning kill by Hartong.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the previous two sets, UCSB did not lose its composure. Tied 10-10, a kill by freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt put the Gauchos up 11-10 and they did not look back. Leading 14-12, a block by Thompson and freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt sealed the 3-2 upset.</p>\n<p>Thompson once again led the way for UCSB with 10 block assists and 19 kills, both team-highs, while Spindt added a double-double with 12 kills and 17 digs.

Opening the third quarter, the Gauchos tied the game, but back-to-back goals from Pacific gave the Tigers a lead they would keep the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>For Pacific, senior attacker Kevin Oliviera scored a team-high three goals, while UCSB’s Gronow tallied three goals as well. However, senior goalkeeper Alex Malkis came up with 13 saves for the Tigers, compared to 11 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started off the tournament strong, defeating Concordia for the second time this season thanks to a quick start.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos outscored the Eagles 4-1 in the first quarter and 3-1 in the second to take a 7-2 lead into halftime.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Hawaii’s only loss this year came against No. 8 San Diego, but the Rainbow Wahine have since gone on a 13-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons they have been able to dominate is because there isn’t anything they’re not good at. Hawaii owns the Big West’s leaders in kills, digs and assists per set. Although the Gauchos don’t boast the record or statistics that a team like Hawaii does, they are confident in their ability to compete this weekend.</p>\n<p>“We’re really going to have to stay focused and disciplined to beat Hawaii,” senior outside hitter Katey Thompson said. “We really want to and that’s a huge part of it. If we play our best volleyball then I really believe we can come away with a win.”</p>\n<p>If they’re going to be able to get the win, the Gauchos will have to try and find an answer for senior outside hitter Emily Hartong; something no team has done yet this season. Hartong leads the way with 259 kills and a .308 kill percentage. Setting her up is senior setter Mita Uiato, who leads the conference with 10.91 assists per set.</p>\n<p>If Hawaii’s offense wasn’t already enough to deal with, its defense is tops in the Big West as well. Senior libero Ali Longo leads the conference with 230 digs and junior middle hitter Kalei Adolpho adds another dimension with her ability to contribute both offensively and defensively. Adolpho’s .423 hitting percentage and 1.09 blocks per set put her at second and fifth in the Big West, respectively.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to take a lot of hard work,” sophomore setter Hanna Nielson said. “We’ve been practicing really hard so we just need to figure out our passing and continue to be aggressive on defense. If we put everything together we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, they will need to continue relying on Thompson, whose 3.51 kills per set are good for second in the conference. Freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt has been playing excellently as well, and is second on the team in kills with 145.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to play extremely well, but I know one thing about this team is they rise to every challenge,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “There’s not one team in the country that we can’t play with, so we’re looking forward to it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has won two straight conference games thanks to solid team play and contributions from every player on the court. Perhaps the most important contribution though has come from Sully, who recently made the switch from outside hitter to libero.</p>\n<p>Despite only starting the last three matches at libero, she is fifth in the conference in digs with 188 and third on the team in kills with 136.</p>\n<p>“Last year we didn’t have a great match there so a lot of people are ready to come out and get some revenge on them,” Sully said.</p>\n<p>The match starts Saturday at 7:00 p.m. in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/","id":5309,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5308,5307,5306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fighting to Stay Undefeated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-23.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-23.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on Cal State Northridge on the road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Rare are the opportunities when a team has a chance to make a statement with one victory and establish itself as the team to beat in its conference.

The Matadors enter Friday’s contest with a 10-1 overall record and 2-0 mark in conference play.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup will feature the only undefeated teams in the Big West, as the two squads will fight for early supremacy in the conference. Northridge opened conference play with victories over Sacramento State and UC Davis, while Santa Barbara defeated Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a huge game because they’ve done really well this year. They’re ranked Top 10,” freshman forward Ismaila Jome said. “To get a win against them would put us in a great position to get a playoff birth for the NCAA tournament. We’re just looking forward; it’s a great way to start the conference so heading into it our confidence will be boosted.”</p>\n<p>Both the Matadors and Gauchos enter the match with three consecutive shutout victories, with Northridge holding the top goal scoring team in the conference and UCSB maintaining the top defensive team with only nine goals allowed all season. Something has to give come tomorrow night.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely, fresh off a Big West Defensive Player of the Week award, has posted three straight shutouts for UCSB and can only hope he and the rest of the backline can reign in the dangerous offensive attack of the Matadors.</p>\n<p>“During the season, we play games that we lose 1-0 and we do the best we can. So the coaching staff told us the only way we’re going to win a game is to have a shutout and that is reflected in our games right now.” Baiden said. “That’s the goal for us now, getting a shutout. If we don’t score, we make sure the other team doesn’t score, so that’s been our main focus.”</p>\n<p>That Northridge offense features the second and third leading goal-scorers in the conference in junior forward Sagi Lev-Ari (eight goals) and senior forward Brian Behrad (six goals).</p>\n<p>UCSB is no slouch offensively, however, featuring two seniors, midfielder Goffin Boyoko and forward Achille Campion, whose four goals are tied for seventh in the conference. Jome also ranks tied for third in the Big West with five assists on the season.</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos finish what is sure to be an emotional game against Northridge, they must immediately turn their focus to an up-and-down Irvine squad that enters the contest with a 6-3-2 overall record and 1-1 mark in conference.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters began conference play with a loss at UC Davis before rebounding with a victory against Sacramento State on Sunday. Irvine will also host Cal Poly Friday night before facing UCSB Sunday.</p>\n<p>This weekend looks to be a pivotal one for the Gauchos, with the match against Northridge looming especially large.</p>\n<p>“It’s as big as any game in conference, there’s no bigger game,” Campion said. “Let’s make a statement and go beat them.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s match is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start time at Matador Soccer Field while Sunday’s game against Irvine has a 4 p.m. kickoff at Anteater Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/","id":1607,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1606,1605,1604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Hawaii For First Road Trip of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_00.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_00.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB preview at Hawaii","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite travelling to Hawaii today, it will be all business for the UCSB women’s soccer team, which seeks a result in a pivotal match early in the conference season.

Beckley notched the only goal in Friday’s win against Irvine, bringing her goal total to five, the most on the team. Aside from her goals, Beckley has been creating scoring chances for the Gauchos by recording two assists, tied second on the team.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will rely on its home crowd for tonight’s matchup. Last season, the Rainbow Wahine were not able to win a conference game on the road, yet only lost one league game when playing in Hawaii. A key point of emphasis for Santa Barbara will be the passing game. Turnovers by way of errant passes derailed the Gauchos offensive opportunities in its last lost.</p>\n<p>“[The game plan] doesn’t really change terribly. We want to do what we do well,” Stumpf said. “Some of the goals we have is we want to possess the ball 65 percent of the game or more, we want to create more chances for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to be on lookout for junior forward Tiana Fujimoto who has scored six goals on the season, second in the league, and is the Warrior’s main threat on offense.</p>\n<p>Once the Gauchos finish playing the Warriors, they will head back to California for a matchup against Cal State Northridge (5-7-1 overall, 0-1-1 conference). Despite the long distance traveled in few days, the players are set on playing at the same level of intensity.</p>\n<p>“We have that Friday, Saturday gap so I don’t think we’ll be that concerned with Sunday’s game,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “It’s about mentality, so you got to go out there and think [you’re] going to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Cynthia Tafoya will guard the back of the net for the Matadors and will present trouble for UCSB offensively; her 44 saves on the season are fifth in the league.</p>\n<p>Kickoff for tonight’s match against Hawaii is scheduled for 10 p.m. and Sunday’s game at Cal State Northridge will begin at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/","id":1605,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1604,1603,1602],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 6 Gauchos Face the Top Teams in the Nation at the SoCal Tournament, Play No. 11 Concordia Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_MWaterpolo_100712-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_MWaterpolo_100712-1.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB men's water polo heads to SoCal Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo sits at 11-2 on the season, and will compete in the SoCal Tournament this weekend hosted by UC Irvine.

After uncertainty as to the Kings’ future in Sacramento, the team is staying for the long run with new ownership, marking a new era in the Capital City.</p>\n<p>The Kings aren’t a team that will be in contention for an NBA championship this season, but as a rebuilding year, Sacramento will be looking for growth and improvement, and lots of it. The team has compiled some solid pieces that should at the very least make the Kings competitive on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>“We really have the pieces in place to be a special team,” point guard Isaiah Thomas said. “The goal is to make the playoffs. If everything comes together, if we play consistently and give it all we got, I think we can compete for one of those spots in the Western Conference.”</p>\n<p>Anchoring the franchise is center DeMarcus Cousins. The third-year player was just given a four-year, $62 million contract extension, showing the Kings’ faith that Cousins is their franchise player. Sacramento needs Cousins to step up as the team’s leader and be a consistent, dominant big man. Last season, Cousins averaged 17.1 points and 9.9 rebounds, but struggled with maturity. If Cousins can step up, he could change the path of the Kings in a very positive way.</p>\n<p>General Manager Pete D’Alessandro’s biggest offseason move was shipping off Tyreke Evans, which is a perfect symbol of the changing culture in Sacramento. No longer will the Kings be a selfish team, but will focus instead on selflessness and defense.</p>\n<p>Even without Evans, the Kings are deep at point guard. Competing for the starting role are Greivis Vasquez and Thomas. Vasquez is a pass-first point guard, ranking third in the NBA last season in assists at 9.0 per game. Thomas, on the other hand, is a quick fire cracker who, at just 5’9’’, can get underneath the defense. The opposing styles of the two should bode well for the Kings, giving the team plenty of choice for different situations.</p>\n<p>“Greivis is not the quickest of guards, but he’s big in size and can post up and use his body. Also, he can look over the defense and distribute the ball,” forward Jason Thompson said. “And Isaiah obviously isn’t the tallest guy there but has a huge heart and brings a lot of energy. He can really shoot the three-ball too.”</p>\n<p>Starting at the shooting guard position will be Marcus Thornton, a natural scorer. Also available is rookie Ben McLemore, a terrific shooter from Kansas. Malone also has a few options at the small forward shot with veteran John Salmons and Luc Mbah a Moute. Both are great defenders,and Salmons brings veteran leadership, entering his 12th NBA season.</p>\n<p>“John is a talented player. He’s been around the league a long time and he’s a versatile guy,” Malone said. “And bringing a guy like [Luc] into our culture is a huge bonus because of all the things he stands for: professionalism, hard work, defense and high character.”</p>\n<p>Possibly the deepest position for Sacramento is the power forward spot, with Thompson, Carl Landry and Patrick Patterson all viable options for the Kings. Thompson, the athletic, long big man, averaged 10.9 points and 6.7 rebounds per game last season.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know that there’s any other NBA team that has the depth that we have at the power forward,” Malone said. “They all bring something different to the table, but those are three players that deserve to be on the floor.”</p>\n<p>While Sacramento didn’t sign a marquee player to send them to be a shoe-in for the playoffs, the improvement for the Kings is evident. With so much unknown as to how everything will come together, the Kings could make some noise and show a glimmer of hope that they might return to their glory days.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA playoffs last season, it seemed L.A. had all the pieces to go far. But despite the incredible offensive firepower, the squad flopped when it mattered, falling to Memphis in the first round.</p>\n<p>Five months later, the Clippers still have a roster full of talent, keeping all core players intact. A different style though, will be on display as L.A. brought in a new head coach, Doc Rivers. Rivers will bring a more fluid, balanced offense to the Clippers as well as an emphasis on defense.</p>\n<p>Therefore, “lob city” is no more in L.A., but that shouldn’t matter. This should be a fun team to watch with two of the most exciting players in the league. Point guard Chris Paul is the first, averaging 16.9 points and 9.7 assists last season, second best in the league.</p>\n<p>Power forward Blake Griffin can fly high, throwing down monstrous dunks. Last season, he averaged 18 points and 8.3 rebounds as the go-to player for the Clippers. Playing next to Griffin is Jordan, the Clippers defensive presence with 1.4 blocks per game last season.</p>\n<p>The additions of J.J. Reddick and Darren Collison to solidify the shooting guard spot along with role players Matt Barnes and Jamal Crawford, the Clippers have compiled a roster that’s ready to win games.</p>\n<p>Last year, the LA team in red, white and blue won its first division title and earned 50 wins for the first time in its 44-year history. This year, the Clippers absolutely have the pieces to outright win it again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>\n<p>One thing will determine the Los Angeles Lakers’ success this year: injuries. The team is full of aging veterans, who together could be great, but have to remain on the floor.</p>\n<p>The Lakers lost many key players in the offseason, including Dwight Howard, Metta World Peace and Earl Clark, leaving plenty of pressure on three big players for L.A.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant, one of best players in the game, is still out after rupturing his Achilles tendon at the end of last season. He’s not expected for the season opener, but when he returns, he’ll be back to prove himself after people questioned whether the injury would end his career. Last season, the “Black Mamba” averaged 27.3 points per game on 57 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>The Lakers will always be dangerous with Bryant on the floor, but he is showing the very beginning signs of slowing down and needs to make sure he doesn’t come back too soon.</p>\n<p>Point guard Steve Nash only played in 50 games last year., but at 39, still has the ability to be great, averaging 12.7 points and 6.7 assists last season.</p>\n<p>And then there’s forward Pau Gasol, who is probably thrilled Howard is gone. The two didn’t mix well, and Gasol will finally own that big man role. As a result, the Lakers should expect an increase from his 13.7 points per game last year.</p>\n<p>One problem for the Lakers this season will be depth. They brought in Jordan Farmar and Chris Kaman, but their bench isn’t nearly as strong as it has been in years past.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Lakers could make the playoffs, but everything will have to go right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Golden State Warriors</p>\n<p>The darlings of last year’s NBA playoffs return even stronger this year.</p>\n<p>To start, the team picked up veteran Andre Iguodala, an athletic small forward who can bring it on the defensive end as well as score, averaging 1.7 steals and 13.0 points per game last season. He adds a defensive presence to a team that is typically very offensive-minded.</p>\n<p>Of course, the most important player on the roster is Stephen Curry, who averaged 22.9 points and 6.9 assists last season. He shot just over 45 percent from behind the arc, setting an NBA record of 272 made threes.</p>\n<p>Combined with Klay Thompson, the duo scored 483 threes, more than any other twosome in NBA history.</p>\n<p>The focus on the three-point shot leaves plenty of space inside for both Andrew Bogut and David Lee. Lee averaged 18.5 points per game, second on the team last season, as well as 11.2 rebounds. Along with Iguodala, they should be able to go inside or out.</p>\n<p>What kept the Warriors from moving deeper in the playoffs last year was their inability to finish games. Now, the team has another year of experience under their belt and has added a few veterans, leaving the team extremely dangerous down the stretch of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Phoenix Suns</p>\n<p>Every division needs its cellar dweller. In the Pacific Division, Phoenix is that team.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Suns finished at the bottom of Western conference at 25-57. Although the team hired a new head coach in NBA legend Jeff Hornacek, the team is still without any stars for him to work with.</p>\n<p>The team acquired guards Eric Bledsoe and Gerald Green, but lost Michael Beasley and second-leading scorer Luis Scola.</p>\n<p>The team will rely on point guard Goran Dragic to lead the team, which he did last year with 14.7 points and 7.4 assists per game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of Oct. 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kristen Henneman of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/","id":602,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[601,600,599],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Making a Difference on and Off the Field","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A women's soccer feature on freshman Kailey Hackett.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Playing in the Mecca of college soccer under the Friday night lights every week is what all collegiate soccer players dream of although few actually get to experience it.</p>\n<p>However, some of these soccer players can get lost in the shuffle off the pitch once the referee blows the final whistle.

It’s basically a day for them to come to our school,” Hackett said. “We play with them, basically make their day and are with them.”</p>\n<p>The program, which celebrated its fifth anniversary last year, is free of cost and held at Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, CA — the very school that Hackett attended. Designed for children ages five and up with special needs, the program allows for each of the kids to get the opportunity to develop their skills and self-esteem through soccer.</p>\n<p>Besides participating in soccer activities, the children spend plenty of time interacting with the volunteers in various other events organized, such as face painting, balloon art and giveaways.</p>\n<p>The matter hits close to home for Hackett, who was inspired to volunteer after hearing the story of one of her best friend’s cousins being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. That account encouraged Hackett to participate in TOPSoccer, a decision that has left just as big of a mark on her as it does on the children she helps. Although the program runs for only one day, it still leaves Hackett with a profound sense of self every year.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, it feels really awesome because you’re doing something for someone else and having that feeling — there are no words to describe it really,” Hackett said. “I’m very thankful for everything and my health and being a part of making them happy.”</p>\n<p>Despite her endeavors outside of the soccer field, Hackett is quick to remind the crowd of how good of a player she is when she does step onto the grass.</p>\n<p>In the first games of the season, Hackett has complemented the defense of the Gauchos and earned herself considerable playing time for a freshman. In nine games played so far, she has started four of them and proven to be a valuable asset to an already strong defense that features four seniors in the backline. In fact, Hackett was a part of four of UCSB’s shutout wins when it went on a five-game winning streak earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“We brought her in to play center back,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We kind of expect Kailey, once [the starters] graduate, to really kind of step in and be that starter that’s going to play an awful lot of minutes at the center back spot.”</p>\n<p>Accustomed to the big stage in high school where she led her team to a CIF championship, the college game brings with it some challenges and a learning curve Hackett still has to adjust to. Just like any other freshman playing for a different team, her first instances wearing the UCSB uniform brought an array of emotions to her, considering how far she has come and what she has given in the past.</p>\n<p>“It was nerve-racking and exciting at the same time because I worked really hard to get this far,” Hackett said. “It feels rewarding because I worked really hard to get to where I am right now.”</p>\n<p>When she is not tackling the ball away from defenders, Hackett is busy tackling the books. Her soccer aspirations fall in line with her academics and just like any student athlete, she still juggles time between the gym and the classroom.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty stressful because of how much homework we have but I think it’s really awesome at the same time because you’re involved with so much stuff,” said Hackett.</p>\n<p>When the season ends, Hackett plans on returning to her hometown of Coto de Caza where she will join TOPSoccer once again for the winter at her high school.

However, until that week, I’m arguing the Broncos have a slight, yet clear, edge over Seattle, Indianapolis and San Francisco as the top team in the league.</p>\n<p>What I will argue though, is that Peyton Manning is by far the best quarterback in the league right now, setting an NFL record for the most touchdown passes (20) during the first five games of the season. On Sunday, Manning passed Dan Marino for second all-time in career passing yards and is about 10,000 behind leader Brett Favre. Manning will most definitely go down as one of the greatest quarterbacks ever, and if he can keep up his elite performance level, and even add a Super Bowl victory or two to his resume, that stock will go even higher.</p>\n<p>For all of the Broncos’ ability in the pass game, Denver has a somewhat questionable running game, with no real dominant running back. While that may not be an issue when looking at the history of recent Super Bowl champions, the lack of a back that is capable of racking up 100 yards on a weekly basis could develop into an issue.</p>\n<p>Defensively, Denver gives up a ton of yards through the air, as evidenced by Romo’s performance this past week. But the return of Von Miller from suspension should aid in the Broncos pressuring opposing quarterbacks and forcing them to get rid of the ball before they locate an open receiver.</p>\n<p>If I had to make a call right now, I’d select Denver to defeat Seattle in the Super Bowl this season, but injuries happen, and if a team gets hot at the right time, like the Ravens last season, all predictions are thrown out the window, especially after only five weeks of the season.</p>\n<p>I’m saying that Denver is elite, but historically average, as many other teams in the history of football had fewer weak spots and areas of concern than the Broncos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/","id":3229,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3228,3227,3226],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"He Said, He Said: Broncos Have a Chance to Go Undefeated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Manning.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Manning.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Are the Denver Broncos one of the best teams ever?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The 2013 Denver Broncos have as good a chance to go undefeated as any team in recent memory.

Demaryius Thomas is playing as well as any wide receiver in football right now, and would have even gaudier numbers if not for Wes Welker and Eric Decker sharing targets. Consider first-year starter Julius Thomas emerging as the best tight end in football not named Jimmy Graham, and Denver has the best four pass-catchers that we’ve seen in recent memory … maybe ever.</p>\n<p>The three-headed mini-monster of Knowshon Moreno, Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman are more than serviceable in a pass-heavy NFL, considering the New Orleans Saints, Green Bay Packers and New York Giants all won the Super Bowl in the last five years with less firepower out of the backfield. They each provide something unique and valuable to the team, with Moreno being the workhorse and pass-blocker, Ball being the goal-line threat and power back and Hillman providing quickness and an explosive playmaking element. Moreno in particular is having the career-year everyone has been waiting for, averaging over five yards per carry with defenses sagging off to protect against the dangerous pass attack.</p>\n<p>Granted, the defense gives up a ton of passing yards, but this is only because opponents are usually down by multiple touchdowns in the first quarter and throw like mad in an attempt to play catch-up. When it comes down to it, cornerbacks Champ Bailey and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie are talented enough to make big plays in the outside, and the return of linebacker Von Miller gives Denver a much-needed playmaking pass-rusher.</p>\n<p>Statistically, Denver is first in the NFL in yards allowed against the run, although, on paper, their interior defensive line and linebackers might be considered a weakness. Their dynamic passing offense covers up this chink in the armor, as the numbers show.</p>\n<p>The last team to make an honest attempt at going undefeated was the 2009 Indianapolis Colts. They won the first 14 games of the regular season and might have gone undefeated if not for resting their starters in the final two games. The quarterback of that historic team: Peyton Manning. Now, in the last few years of his career, maybe Peyton will decide to go out, play 16 weeks of world-class football and make a run at history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52376\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52376\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/","id":3228,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3227,3226,3225],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeat Rival Cal Poly 3-1","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_102012-6.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_102012-6.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball defeats rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the season’s first chapter of the Blue-Green Rivalry, the UCSB women’s volleyball team came away with a 3-1 victory over Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos improved to 7-8 overall and are now tied for third in the Big West with a 2-1 conference record.

A block by sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau and freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg gave the Gauchos a 25-22 win and tied the match at 1-1.</p>\n<p>“We were resilient,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We made some little adjustments, we cleaned up our side and put a little more pressure on them and that’s what we needed to do.”</p>\n<p>The third set was over before it began for Cal Poly as UCSB jumped out to a quick 7-2 lead.

Sophomore opposite Jaylen Villanueva ended the game with a kill to make it 25-22 and give the Gauchos a 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>“Throughout the season so far we’ve kind of been a comeback team and we’ve had a lot of slow starts,” senior outside hitter Leah Sully said. “I think everyone on the team knows that we’re capable of making that push at the end.”</p>\n<p>Spindt continued a stretch of fantastic performances with 13 digs and a career-high 17 kills. Thompson also stayed consistent with 16 kills of her own. Sophomore setter Hanna Nielson added a double-double with 27 assists and 14 digs.</p>\n<p>“We kept our composure really well,” Thompson said. “We just knew what we had to do and [we] know regardless of what the score is, it’s not over until it hits 25.”</p>\n<p>The win is the Gauchos’ second straight overall and fourth in a row over Cal Poly, dating back to 2011.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a trip to No. 6 Hawaii, which will take place on Saturday at 7 p.m. in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article appeared on page 6 of  October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52338\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52338\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/","id":5279,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5278,5277,5276],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_093012-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_093012-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Irvine but falls to Long Beach.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With every victory there is always room for improvement.

CSULB was not finished for the half and scored again eight minutes later when junior midfielder Taylor Nelson shot from distance into the corner of the goal to put the 49ers up by two heading into the second half.</p>\n<p>“Momentum is a really hard thing to turn around,” Stumpf said. “We were really chasing the game for the first 20, 30 minutes.”</p>\n<p>With adjustments made coming into the second half, UCSB was nearly able to even the game but was still unable to establish any rhythm offensively. Long Beach’s early momentum was enough to carry them past the Gauchos for a 2-1 win. After a shutout win on Friday, the Gaucho defense was not on par with Friday’s performance.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Sunday game, it’s hot in the afternoon and [the defense] played a lot of minutes on Friday night,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “They worked hard, the best they can do … They played to the maximum of their ability.”</p>\n<p>Despite getting behind in the first half against Long Beach, Friday’s match against UC Irvine brought better results for the Gauchos. The two teams were in a defensive stalemate for the first half until UCSB broke through late with a goal in the 44th minute. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley headed in a cross for her team-high fifth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>UCI entered the second half with more inspired play and became aggressors on the offensive side of the pitch. Being limited to only three shots in the first 45 minutes of the game, the Anteaters had 10 shots in the second half. However, the solid Gaucho defense remained on point and kept UCI from getting off a serious threat on goal.</p>\n<p>In the final minutes of the game, the Gauchos began to slow down, causing Irvine to take advantage of the worn-out defensive. UCSB was able to survive the late scare by the Anteaters to hang on to the 1-0 win.</p>\n<p>“I think we only won two conference games all last year and I kind of put Irvine at the top of the pile in the teams in the Big West, so to get a result off them on a Friday night at home is great,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>It was UCSB’s sixth shutout win in its last eight games before losing on Sunday. Sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter continued her stellar play between the nets, coming up huge for five saves to preserve Friday’s shutout.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now travel to Hawaii to face the Warriors on Thursday, followed by another road game against Cal State Northridge on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":1600,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1599,1598,1597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West With Two Shutouts","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MSoccer-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MSoccer-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Fullerton, Riverside at home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With conference play opening up this weekend, the UCSB men’s soccer team announced to the rest of the league that they are ready to retake their claim as top dogs in the Big West.

Senior forward Achille Campion scored a goal 37 seconds into the game, setting the tone for the Gauchos early on. Campion’s goal was a team-high fourth on the season off a through ball from senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko, while senior defender Daniel Welsh also received an assist on the play.</p>\n<p>After Campion gave UCSB the advantage, the game developed into a physical match as nine yellow cards were issued during the night, with players from both teams not backing down. Play throughout the game was extremely chippy, especially during the second half.</p>\n<p>“To me, it starts and ends that there’s a responsibility for the man with the whistle. The reality is [the referee] let a lot go,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we were tough enough, strong enough. We didn’t lose our composure, we didn’t freak out. I wasn’t joking when I said I was happy that we won the game, we had no injuries and we didn’t take a red card.”</p>\n<p>Playing with a 1-0 lead, the Gauchos received an insurance goal from freshman forward Ismaila Jome in the 82nd minute to cement the result as a UCSB victory. Jome’s shot from beyond the box was the first goal of his career.</p>\n<p>“I feel like [the offense is] progressing pretty well,” Jome said. “I’m new to the team, [freshman midfielder Drew Murphy] is new to the team and we have a couple more freshmen playing, so we’re just getting used to each other and playing up top with [Campion and Boyoko].”</p>\n<p>Defensively, UCSB was led by freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely who recorded five saves and posted his third consecutive shutout.</p>\n<p>“Our defense has finally found itself. They’re competing for balls, they’re competing for everything and they’re not leaving loose balls,” Vom Steeg said. “Josh is making the one or two plays that he has to make. The bottom line is we always thought our defense was going to be good this year; it just takes us a while. These are two games that we had to have this weekend and nothing’s ever easy.”</p>\n<p>While Sunday’s game certainly displayed the Gauchos’ superiority, UCSB was even more dominant on Friday night against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos received goals from three seniors not usually known for putting the ball in the back of the net in midfielder Fifi Baiden and defenders Peter Schmetz and Matt Glodack. Santa Barbara controlled the game, owning an 18-11 advantage in shots and a 7-4 edge in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Campion and Jome each recorded an assist on the night, while Murphy added two for the Gauchos. Jome led the team in assists with five on the season.</p>\n<p>“I think we are clicking, we’re getting our team chemistry right now,” Baiden said. “At the beginning of every season, we have a lot of freshman on the team and people get injured, so it’s hard to find that team rhythm. But now everything is great, people are getting back from injury and we’re getting an understanding of how everyone plays.”</p>\n<p>McNeely was solid once again between the posts, making four saves on the night for the Gauchos. Thanks in large part to McNeely, UCSB has recorded shutouts in three consecutive matches for the first time since 2010 and sits atop the Big West North division standings.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely confidence when you don’t get scored on, that feels great because that means we can work going forward,” Campion said. “I think everyone did a good job and I’m proud of my teammates.”</p>\n<p>While defense was certainly a key to the victory, the offense found a groove, scoring three goals, and tied for a season-high with two other occasions in the year.</p>\n<p>“It was very important for our team confidence and what we’re trying to do in terms of winning the Big West tournament or winning a Big West championship,” Baiden said. “It’s good for us, it sets the tone for the next game and we’re going to be fired up for the next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Cal State Northridge for a 7 p.m. match on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52342\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52342\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/","id":1601,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1600,1599,1598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Look at the MLB Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-forcivilminds.org_.jpg?resize=259%2C194&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-forcivilminds.org_.jpg?resize=259%2C194&ssl=1","description":"MLB column","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The MLB regular season is a grueling six-month struggle to stay healthy, fight through injuries and constantly convince yourself that every game matters, even though an August matchup with San Diego may seem trivial and pointless in the long, hot dog days of summer. Through these trials, favorites emerge and division dynasties are formed. Teams like the Yankees, Braves, Cardinals, Phillies and Rangers are used to looking forward to October as the time when their games really matter.</p>\n<p>However, when that time comes, anything can happen. One injury, one hot streak, one fluky month can change the entire complexion of the MLB postseason. Nine different teams have won the World Series in the last 12 years.  Ten different teams have lost the World Series in that time. The Dodgers, A’s and Indians are in a position to inflate those numbers. And this year, the Pittsburg Pirates are in the playoffs for the first time in my lifetime. The best part: They’re legit.</p>\n<p>In a wild baseball year when there are three single-game elimination rounds before the Division Series even begin, the 2013 World Series title is as open as ever. However, there is a formula for success that can be traced back over the last decade. Pitching wins championships, and this year, a few teams are loaded.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>According to the numbers, the Dodgers have two of the top five pitchers in baseball. In addition to Co-Aces Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, L.A. sports two solid number threes in Hyun-jin Ryu and Ricky Nolasco. But the Dodgers are dealing with injuries to star outfielders Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier, causing them to sputter down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Whether L.A. faltered due to injuries, resting their starters or losing their momentum, they better hope their pitchers rebound to the elite level that they were at during the Dodgers’ historic hot streak. If not, St. Louis, Atlanta and Pittsburg are waiting in the wings.</p>\n<p>The Pirates can match the Dodgers’ pitching on any given day, even if they don’t have the payroll and the star power. AJ Burnett is looking like a revelation after being an injured shell of his former self in recent years. Francisco Liriano had the Cy Young season that people have been predicting since he was co-lead of a Minnesota Twins rotation with Johan Santana.</p>\n<p>While they haven’t had the headlines this season, the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves continue their persistent excellence by way of the “next-man-up” philosophy. Longtime Atlanta number one Tim Hudson went down with an injury, but next up is Kris Medlen who takes over the ace mantle after a September in which he went 4-0 with a 1.00 ERA. In year 2 PA [post-Albert], the Cardinals feature two first basemen with .300 averages in Allen Craig and Matt Adams.</p>\n<p>The National League is stacked, but on the American League side of things, the Red Sox, A’s and Rays are playing to prove that they’re for real, again. All three teams have enjoyed sustained success, but the lack of star power causes critics to doubt their legitimacy.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox, who scored more runs than anyone in the game, just won the toughest division in baseball on way to the best record of all 30 teams. Yet they’re not even considered the favorites in the American League, a distinction that belongs to the Tigers, led by Miguel Cabrera. I guess people can’t believe that the Red Sox are for real after trading Adrian Gonzalez and blowing up their team last year. But with Mike Napoli filling the void admirably, David Ortiz having a career year, and the rest of the lineup getting on base and hitting with runners in scoring position, the Red Sox could surprise everyone. Well, everyone who didn’t pay attention to the numbers.</p>\n<p>And for the second year in a row, Oakland surprised everyone and took the AL West. The legend of Josh Donaldson continues in the bay to ease the pain of the Giants fall from grace, and it seems like they have about a dozen quality pitchers waiting in the wings. If Oakland can turn Bartolo Colon into an ace at age 75 and Coco Crisp into a power hitter, I’m sold that the A’s have something supernatural going on.</p>\n<p>But the question remains: can these teams compete with the Tigers? Max Scherzer should win the Cy Young, Miguel Cabrera should be awarded “Best Hitter Of A Generation” distinctions, and Justin Verlander can still throw 101 MPH in the 9th inning of a game in October.</p>\n<p>Underdogs can heat up at any given moment as well. Just ask the Giants. San Francisco will testify that in can happen two out of three years in fact. It all comes down to health, nerves and preparation. A star-studded team like the Dodgers can choke after a cold streak down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Or they could blanket the Cardinals with dominant starting pitching that allows the bullpen to rest until the NLCS. Miguel Cabrera could hit .700 with half a dozen home runs in three games to bomb the Tigers over the A’s. Hell, he could hit like that but the rest of the lineup could freeze in the face of no-name Oakland pitchers who find their groove and hit their spots. And Josh Donaldson might hit .800 and will his team to victory.</p>\n<p>Ok that last one might be a bit of a stretch, but with the parity in baseball this year, we should be in for a postseason for the ages.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of forcivilminds.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/","id":3224,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3223,3222,3221],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":145,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
