To be a man in the world of sports is to shut out fear and uncertainty, to exude aggressiveness and passion and to limit doubt and over-thinking. To be a man is to win.</p>\n<p>Other than the archaic gendered connotations of the phrase, these lessons aren’t necessarily bad on paper. Many coaches point to the application of what they teach even outside of sports as rationale for why athletes should listen. American society is theoretically organized to value self-confidence and hard work. There’s supposed to be winners and losers, and if you believe in yourself and put in the work then you can achieve anything. We use Kobe Bryant’s relentless perfectionism, LeBron James’ refined diet and workouts and Michael Jordan’s extreme work ethic as examples of those at the top getting to where they are by devotion and, more importantly, by choice. Of course they are successful; they chose to work hard to get there.</p>\n<p>Due to the innate link between economic success and happiness in the American consciousness, this ultimately comes to mean that they chose to be happy, and by extension anyone else with just some hard work and elbow grease can choose to be happy too. But what about the millions of people who don’t always have the opportunities or resources or neurological capabilities to “choose” to be happy — where do they fit in?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Toronto Raptors’ perennial All-Star DeMar DeRozan made headlines recently because of an interview around this topic with the Toronto Star. “It’s one of them things that no matter how indestructible we look like we are, we’re all human at the end of the day,” DeRozan explained. “We all got feelings … all of that. Sometimes … it gets the best of you, there’s times everything in the whole world’s on top of you.”</p>\n<p>This interview came on the heels of a tweet which DeRozan sent out in February that simply read “This depression get the best of me…” and sparked a national dialogue around how society stigmatizes and stifles mental health awareness among male athletes. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love expanded on this conversation in a piece he penned for the Players’ Tribune, in which he pointed out that “These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they’re everywhere . . . and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water.”</p>\n<p>There are two especially important points that DeRozan and Love made in their statements, and both offer solutions to deal with the issues surrounding mental health education. The first is that anyone at any time can be affected by some sort of mental illness, although it is important to note that there are very important outside factors (degree of illness, race, gender identity, economic status) which affect both the support for and impact of these problems. The second is that there is a very specific socialization of men, by men, that occurs in the United States, which manifests itself into toxic ideologies and actions for men ourselves and the communities we inhabit.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that in order to start working on the issues of misrepresentation and miseducation when it comes to mental health, there has to be acknowledgment that there are problems in the first place. This is why it was important to hear not just an NBA player, but a Black NBA player, come out and address a topic like depression.</p>\n<p>Centuries of oppression, whether it be through the restriction of access to medical knowledge and care or the dehumanization and desensitization of Black and brown suffering, has created extreme stigma within communities of color surrounding mental health. Black Americans are more likely to undergo feelings of depression and worthlessness than white Americans, and yet, according to Mental Health America, have less access to treatment and actually utilize help at far lower rates.</p>\n<p>It would be far simpler to address these statistics if it was simply a matter of outward exclusion; however, internal attitudes ingrained over the years complicate accessibility as well. Because of historical precedents such as the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment or contemporary exclusion from groups such as the American Psychological Organization (of which Black Americans only make up 2 percent), there has been a cultural isolation of Black and brown communities from the medical community, which in turn has led to the solidification of negative and inaccurate ideologies.</p>\n<p>The characterization of mental illness as “weakness” or as in opposition to masculinity is very prevalent within these communities and has a tangible impact, such as the marginally higher attempted suicide rates among young Black boys compared to white children. By exposing his own fragility, DeRozan has helped counter this and start toward creating an atmosphere where Black and brown children are believed and supported.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that it is men who have to take on most of the burden of unlearning and working toward less stigmatization of mental illness. As we have seen with recent mass school shootings, as well as the well-documented history of male violence in this country, our conception of masculinity or “manhood” is just not healthy. Entitlement and over-confidence combined with a lack of empathy for others might work sometimes on the basketball court, but is a disastrous approach to relationships in other aspects of life.</p>\n<p>The truth is, for women and queer folks of color, most danger and abuse does not come from outside, but rather from straight men of color in their own communities. While all people of color have to deal with racism, stigma surrounding mental illness and lack of accessibility in other aspects of life, it is somehow acceptable to use violence against Black and brown women as an outlet for male frustration and inadequacy. This is a problem for all men, yet one would hope that having to deal with an intersection of other oppressions would give Black and brown men a better understanding of how not to channel their problems into “punching down.” Only once we are able to protect those who are most vulnerable will we be able to attack the institutions or figures in power which are the crux of the problem.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, sports both reflect and create culture. Athletes such as DeRozan and Love speaking up about their own struggles with mental health mirrors a recent illumination of the topic in popular discourse; however, toxic ideals surrounding masculinity in sports have also been ingrained into American society for years. It is up to men to change how we talk and think about mental health, for our well-being and everyone else’s safety.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Not only did the fantastic four receive recognition for an outstanding season, but each of them plans to return next year while 2 of which are merely culminating their freshman season.</p>\n<p>Junior second base clean-up hitter Sierra Altmeyer and sophomore first base facilitator Alyssa Diaz both received second team All-Big West honors, but this was not the first time either player has earned recognition of this caliber.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Altmeyer earns her third honor as an all-league player as the veteran slapped .323 in her junior frame and hit 5 of her 8 team-leading bombs while comfortable in her own ballpark during games in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>She drove in 31 RBIs and was crucial during wins this season in which she hit .382. Her nearly 40% batting average over wins is a full ten percent higher than her .278 batting average during losses.</p>\n<p>Much of the success that Altmeyer had at the plate this year came on the back of fellow infielder Alyssa Diaz who hit in the three spot all year right in front of her complimentary second baseman. Pitchers struggled with Altmeyer in the clean-up because Diaz has such a staunch reputation for getting on base, thus giving Altmeyer so many opportunities to drive in runs.</p>\n<p>While the first baseman Diaz played in all but the final seven games of the season, she assumed a premier leadership role on the team in just her second year as she slashed .325 on the year and turned it on during conference play to improve her average to .357 against Big West foes.</p>\n<p>All five of Diaz’s home runs came during the non-conference half of the season and nearly 78% of her RBIs were against out-of-conference competitors. Nonetheless, the second-year standout was named to the all-conference second team for the second consecutive year.</p>\n<p>Much like Diaz, we saw an influx of outstanding contact hitting from freshman infielder Maci Fines during conference play. The first year began her breakout season at third base but shifted over to the shortstop spot toward the end of the year as sophomore third baseman Kayla Krantz returned from an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>Fines was awarded All-Freshman team honors for the Big West Conference considering her all-star worthy .380 batting average during Big West competition in 2018. Fines ability to read the ball well lead her to the least number of strikeouts between active batters on the UCSB roster as she only got rung up 9 times this season.</p>\n<p>Her batting average and aggressiveness gradually increased as she became more comfortable at the plate in the latter half of the season.</p>\n<p>While Fines hit .231 and .217 respectively in the first of the season, she bettered her batting to .350 in April en route to shining from an outstanding performance in May in which she smacked .458 over a 6-game stretch. In fact, Fines took a six-game hitting streak into the final match against Cal Poly while four of those six games resulted in multi-hit contests for the first year.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian rounds off the list of Gauchos with All-Big West honors as she too earned a spot on the Freshman All-Conference team. Fabian was the sunshine on this team’s season-long cloudy day that was unfortunately covered up by a plethora of other struggles going on with the Gauchos this year.</p>\n<p>Fabian began her career with UCSB this season batting .433 through the first 12 games. She led her fellow ‘Chos in batting average for the majority of the season finishing with a team-high mark of .335 for the year.</p>\n<p>While the three other players that earned honors were the most appealing during Big West play, Fabian boasted early and dominated during non-conference play. The freshman flashed a .356 average to start off the year and notched her way up to fourth in the Big West in steals with 9.</p>\n<p>Yet, when it came to conference competition, Fabian wasn’t nearly as effective. She walked less and struck out more, but what might have hindered her the most was the team’s failure to give Fabian the green light on the base path.</p>\n<p>With the resounding speed and aggressiveness she displayed during the former half of the season, it was surprising how she didn’t steal one single base during conference play. Worst of all though, Fabian was never given the chance on the base path during Big West play. She was signaled to steal zero times after an impeccable first half of her season she spent running all over catchers.</p>\n<p>With only three seniors graduating this year, the Gauchos plan to bring back virtually the whole team in the 2018-2019 season and get a taste of redemption after struggling to win only a third of their games this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

about?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Personally, for me, it was a lot more competitive and provided a lot more opportunities than I originally thought. I came from baseball, and I realized that ultimate frisbee gives you the opportunity to make big plays, like laying out or jumping over people (which we call skying).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: I guess the sport has a big stigma when it comes to the word frisbee in general. You don’t really think of it as a serious sport, you think of it as being in the park or on the beach, but like Arthur said, when you get to college, you see all the intricacies that do come with it, like defenses, or zone or specific skill sets that each player has.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What are some myths about ultimate that you guys would like to dispel? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: I think most people find it super nerdy or hippie, or casual, but in the college level it’s pretty competitive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>When do most people tend to join the team?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well, I would say most people join it their freshman year, yeah.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: I definitely agree with that, but we also get some later years. Whether people hear from their friends or they come in and transfer, we do get some kids who come in after their freshman year, but the majority are definitely freshmen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cool. So</strong><strong>, on more of a long term note, what do you think was your favorite part of Black Tide, or the thing you’ll look back on 10 years from now? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Ooh tough question.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Well, going back to your last question, it’s really cool how you’re able to incorporate all these people from different sports, because very rarely are you able to get someone who played frisbee all through high school. For the most part, it’s a team with people who have played soccer, football, golf, baseball, volleyball, tennis, really just a huge variety of sports. You formulate the team and each player can incorporate their previous experience into a role on a team. I would say that’s one of my favorite parts of Ultimate Frisbee.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: I would say that for me, when I look back, I’m going to look back at all my teammates. Me and Bailey are both graduating this spring, and there’s been a lot of college defining moments with frisbee. I feel like I’ve really grown up with my class rookies, and I learned how to balance a workload with school and practice and hanging out with everybody. Just the whole experience of the team and even beyond the sport itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>So how often does the team practice? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: We practice two days a week on the field and two days of lifting, and then during season, we’ll typically have a tournament on the weekends.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>So is there anything that you guys would like to say about Black Tide in general? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well, I don’t know if you know about the alumni network, but Black Tide was one of the earliest ultimate teams in the nation. We’re tied for the most national championships and as far as connections go you get to meet alumni dating back to 1984, and even in Regionals, we met Tom Kennedy, the founder of Black Tide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What sports tend to translate well into frisbee? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Well, I would say sports that test your agility, like football, soccer, so sports like that translate well into defense. Really, the biggest transition for freshmen is learning how to throw the frisbee and throw it with polish and precision. But then you also have guys like baseball players that have an advantage in terms of throwing, since their arms tend to start off a little bit better, so they might have an advantage to start. But sports like volleyball and basketball help too with verticality, and really a lot of different skill sets can work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What types of positions are there in ultimate? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: The most generic is the handler and the cutter, which if you break that down is similar to a quarterback and wide receiver, where the handler is touching the disc a lot. He has more polish with his throws, while a cutter, his main job is to catch the disc, whether that be with his verticality, something we call his radius of catchability, or just juking out the defender very often. So yeah, in very broad terms those two tend to be the general positions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What would you guys tell people who were thinking about trying out next year? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Arthur:  Well, I would say if you’re unsure, just come out, because for most people, college ultimate is not what their image of it is like at first, whether they played in high school or not. Almost everyone I have talked to has said it’s more competitive than they thought.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bailey: Yeah, I would agree with that. College is all about finding your fit, your group of people. Our team is really diverse, and not just in the sense of diversity, ethnicity or culture, but in our majors, and it can just be more than frisbee. It’s honestly a family. People have gotten jobs through Black Tide, because you really do meet so many different people and you form such deep connections. It really is like a family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What do you guys think your best traditions are? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well I would say one of our best are Black Tide Pride, and honestly, I love our jerseys. I think they’re the best in regionals. We have really cool tie dye jerseys, and those date back to the very beginning of our program.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AK:I would say one that’s been really important to me is BFTB, or “Black Tide for the Boys.” Another great one is “Black Tide Never Dies.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Oh, and a goofy one we sometimes say in games are “ooze, gush, stick, crush.” I still don’t know what that really means.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AK: Well, our team name refers back to the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, so that’s what the ooze gush part is referring back to, and the stick crush part is about sticky defense, and we want to crush the other team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: So right before kickoff, one side will say “ooze, gush,” and the other will say “stick, crush,” just to give that sense of unity, and really showing the people on the field that they have 14 teammates who have their back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s been </strong><strong>the most memorable part of being on the team? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AW: Well, at the end of my freshman year, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a 19-centimeter tumor in my left hip, and I had to do 11 months of chemo. So I went back home, and I was inpatient, which meant I was in the hospital every week. So for me, this team is always for the boys, and that means something to me. In my year off, I still had people driving down to L.A., since I was at UCLA, every few months to check up on me and hang out with me. So for someone who had to leave school for a while, it’s really hard, because all of my friends from high school were at college, and all of my friends at college were obviously at college, so I was alone with my family, so it meant a lot to me to have people drive down. I was just a rookie at the time, and I still had seniors, I still had fifth-year seniors, sophomores, freshmen, just everyone wanted to check up on me. That was the reason [why] when I came back that it didn’t matter the rehab I had to do, it didn’t matter that I couldn’t run the full length of the field without throwing up, because I knew I had to come back to this team. I hadn’t met these people before, like Arthur and Bailey, but it didn’t matter, because I was Black Tide. They were Black Tide, and that means that we’re family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>After the interview with Black Tide, I’m starting to get why people on the team have such a feverish devotion. More than most clubs, the family bonds are really there, and they all seem to really enjoy each other. This was a great experience, and go Black Tide. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

The loss dropped the Gauchos to 24-26-1 on the year as they remained in seventh place in the Big West, while Cal Poly was bolstered up to third place in the conference and a 26-27 record.</p>\n<p>Freshman right-handed pitcher Joshua Candau came in to relieve for the Gauchos in the bottom of the eighth inning after Lincoln walked the first batter. Candau got the first out on a bunt attempt from sophomore Kyle Marinconz at the cost of the runner on first getting into scoring position.</p>\n<p>A fielding error at third base from Jason Willow allowed the subsequent batter Samuelson to get on base and the tying run within 90 feet of the plate. Candau was able to secure the crucial second out on a fly ball hit to left field which was caught.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior Nick Meyer approached the plate and hit a bases clearing double to put the Mustangs ahead, 3-2. The pair of RBIs was Meyer’s 26th and 27th of the season and was a clutch drive with his team down a run late in the game.</p>\n<p>Meyer crossed the plate a batter later on a single through the left side from sophomore Bradlee Beesley to make the score 4-2 in favor of the Mustangs. Candau was pulled from the game for freshman right-handed pitcher Chris Troye who was able to get out of the inning with no further damage.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly reliever Taylor Dollard, who came on midway through the seventh inning, closed out the Gauchos in the top of the ninth, to continue his team’s two game winning streak. The 2.2 inning effort from the freshman earned Dollard his third win of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB sophomore right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln put in seven innings of work in his start  today, giving up five hits and one earned run. Lincoln was stellar in his outing and was clearly in control as he made his around the Cal Poly lineup.</p>\n<p>The performance was a good showing from Lincoln, who suffered his worst start of the season the last time he had taken the mound in a May 12 start against the Long Beach State 49ers where he was pulled after seven earned runs. Despite taking the game past quality start territory, Lincoln was still unable to escape with a win due to the late-inning collapse from the bullpen.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were first to put runs on the board in what was a fairly low-scoring game throughout. Sophomore Tommy Jew smashed his fifth homer of the season off of freshman right handed Cal Poly pitcher Darren Nelson in the bottom of the fourth inning to put the team ahead by one.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs quickly answered back an inning later, after a sequence of hits allowed sophomore Scott Ogrin to score. Sophomore Dylan Doherty singled through the left side and into the outfield for his sixteenth RBI of the season to tie up the game at one all.</p>\n<p>The sixth inning brought on the third consecutive one with a run scored, as Gaucho freshman Drew Williams lined a double to right center field which would bring junior Clay Fisher home from second.</p>\n<p>The run was Fisher’s 32nd and Williams’ fourteenth RBI of the year to put UCSB in the lead, 2-1. The contributions from Fisher and Williams were great to see, but the offense stagnated after taking the lead.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will play their final game of the series against rival Cal Poly Mustangs at Baggett Stadium on Sunday, May 20 at 1 PM PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83216\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-20/ucsb-drops-series-against-rival-mustangs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83216\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-20/ucsb-drops-series-against-rival-mustangs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-20/ucsb-drops-series-against-rival-mustangs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-20/ucsb-drops-series-against-rival-mustangs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-20/ucsb-drops-series-against-rival-mustangs/","id":4097,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4096,4095,4094],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Cross Blue Line with Winningest Season in UCSB History","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hockey21.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hockey21.jpg?resize=980%2C341&ssl=1","description":"After being reinstated for only three years, the UCSB club hockey team has a championship to show for it.

Less than a third of a decade after the team was finally recommissioned and ready to compete, the UCSB Hockey team found itself sitting on the first championship victory in program history as a part of the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association and proud winners of the ever coveted Adams Cup.</p>\n<p>With such unprecedented success in a token couple of seasons, the question remains: How did this fresh legs Gaucho squad come up so successfully in the playoffs?</p>\n<p>Many teams thrive on veteran leadership from experienced third- and fourth-year players to smooth out a transition for the younger guys. Yet with such an infamous history, or more applicably the lack thereof, this squad saw only eight returners in their championship year. A team made up of 60 percent new members is rarely considered a favorite to win a championship, but the fresh legs on UCSB are unique for a group of first-year competitors.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The freshman presence is significant, but these young men are no strangers to playoff and championship experience. The addition of freshman center Collin del Bonis was crucial to the Gauchos’ success this year.</p>\n<p>Del Bonis thrived in crunch time during high school games as he, accompanied by long-time teammates forward Chris Ewasiuk, defensemen Emmett Rupert and goalie Will Hahn, led the Santa Barbara Royals to back-to-back high school championships in the Los Angeles Kings Hockey League in each of two seasons prior, paving a path for each of them to transition to UCSB hockey. Once the key pieces were initiated at the collegiate level, the team knew success was imminent.</p>\n<p>Imminent, not immediate. It took a couple games for these first-year studs to get their ice legs back on track, but once the team got rolling, boy, did they look like a legitimate threat to make a run for the PCHA title.</p>\n<p>“After the first two or three [games], I was ready to go,” del Bonis said when asked about how his preparation ritual had changed with the transition from high school hockey to collegiate level competition. “We had 12 new guys on the team including me… so we didn’t have any chemistry going into those first two games.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara struggled through the opening two games as new roles were assumed and new rotations were learned. As if it weren’t enough that UCSB was ushering in the majority of a new squad, the Gauchos had a tall task in front of them in Santa Clara University. The Broncos were coming off the 2016 season as runners-up for the Adams Cup and they were on a mission for vengeance.<br>\nOn back-to-back days in the latter half of October, UCSB dropped two losses to Santa Clara by scores of 6-2 and 3-1 to kick off the 2017 season.</p>\n<p>However, rather than being demoralized, these young puck handlers quickly became comfortable in their new roles as chemistry gradually grew within the clubhouse over the next week.</p>\n<p>With a couple games, a hiccup of adversity and a stern week of practice under the squad’s belt, the Gauchos fiercely bounced back with two commanding wins, the first coming with a 4-1 score against Cal Lutheran.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 29, UCSB faced off against Stanford and displayed sheer dominance on the ice while scoring a remarkable 15 goals en route to a shutout of the Cardinals. It seemed fitting that this game took place only a couple of days before Halloween because the Gauchos were starting to look like frightening competitors.</p>\n<p>Much of the success for the quick turnaround was accredited to impeccable leadership from an experienced coaching staff that has handled its fair share of adversity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83138\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1878214632\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83138\" data-attachment-id=\"83138\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/gauchos-cross-blue-line-with-winningest-season-in-ucsb-history/club-hockey/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?fit=960%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,565\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"club hockey\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?fit=250%2C147&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?fit=888%2C523&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83138\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?resize=888%2C523\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"523\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?resize=250%2C147&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83138\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Ice Hockey at UCSB’s Facebook page</p></div>\n<p>Former Boston Bruin and assistant coach Steve Heinze led the high school squad of Collin del Bonis and the rest of the Santa Barbara Royals to consecutive championships prior to taking a position with UCSB, so not only is he weathered in terms of hockey knowledge, but Coach Heinze also has a history with many of the first-year players which smoothed the transition in collegiate level competition.<br>\n“If we can just approach [games] with a mindset that we’re going to outwork them…you can teach X’s and O’s and pretty plays to anybody, but what I would like to instill with these guys is hard work wins games,” Henize said. When it comes down to crunch times and the postseason, Henize went on to preach rest and care for the body, saying, “we get in shape and then we go and outwork them.”<br>\nThe staunch squad continued to ride their confidence high rolling into the final game of 2017 on a four-game win streak before resuming play once again in 2018 as the team shifted gears to conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB completed the season with seven wins and five losses, a step behind their success in the 2016-2017 season in which they finished 9-6 in UCSB’s first season as a part of the Division II Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association.<br>\nIn contrast to last year, however, the Gauchos broke the seal with a playoff berth in just their second year in the division.<br>\nOver Presidents’ Day weekend, the Gauchos traveled to Lake Tahoe to compete for the Adams Cup and prove their dominance over the West. With a blowout win against Stanford and an outlasting performance against Cal Lutheran, the Ice ‘Chos found themselves matched up with none other than the Santa Clara Broncos, the very team that dropped UCSB in its first two games of the season.<br>\nBut this was a very different Gaucho team than at the beginning of the season. A much more well-rounded and composed squad, the Gauchos have matured and developed immense chemistry throughout the course of the season.<br>\nHeading into the matchup against Santa Clara, the entire roster was feeling confident and poised as they looked the rival Broncos dead in the eye from point-blank range.</p>\n<p>Third-year forward Jackson Schutz assumed a unique leadership role as one of the older players on the team though competing in his first season of hockey with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The skill has always been present on the team. We have the ability to beat Santa Clara,” Schutz said when questioned about the team’s legitimacy come postseason. He went on to praise his squad, saying, “our first two games of the season, we were just getting to know each other… now at the end of the season, we know each other’s styles of play so well.”</p>\n<p>Through the first two periods in the Gauchos championship match up, the team looked to be in complete control as they built onto a 6-1 lead heading into the final period of the season.

Every playoff team has a star that knows how to get it done, but it often takes the elevated play of an unsuspecting player or two in order to push them to the next level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These players often attain nationwide admiration for clutch play, team leadership, and even relevance in popular meme culture. These qualities mix with the high-intensity of playoff basketball to create a lovable underdog in the eyes of fans.

When that guy looks like everyone’s “cool” high school english teacher and he gets buckets in the playoffs, he reaches another level of admiration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe “Jumping Joe” Ingles has solidified his role as a key player for the Utah Jazz as they surged to end the regular season and kept their momentum moving into the playoffs, where they took down the Thunder in the first round. Ingles lit up OKC for 20+ points two separate times in the six-game series, but it is easy to argue that his most important contribution was getting in Paul George’s head and significantly affecting his play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all culminated in an atrocious 2-16 shooting performance by George in game 6, proving once and for all that Australian trash-talk is one of the most detrimental forms of trash-talk that exists today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingles cooled off slightly as the Jazz fell to the top-seeded Rockets in round two, but he did drop a signature 27-point performance in Utah’s lone win in that series. Joe Ingles has clearly found himself a place on an up-and-coming Utah team that should be a major threat in the upcoming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Rajon Rondo</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"779091223\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83057\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83060\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/activate-playoff-rondo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=756%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"756,414\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"activate-playoff-rondo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=250%2C137&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=756%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83060\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?resize=888%2C486\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?w=756&amp;ssl=1 756w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?resize=250%2C137&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resurgence of “Playoff Rondo” became a major storyline in the playoffs that coincided with the surprise run to the second round by the New Orleans Pelicans. Rondo looked like a lifeless corpse on the basketball court in his seasons without playoff basketball since he left the Celtics in 2014, and we have all been waiting to see what he was capable of with a solid team around him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The opportunity finally presented itself alongside All-Stars Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis in New Orleans, where he finally seemed focused on both ends of the floor and put up some impressive numbers in the team’s two playoff series (10.3 points, 7.6 rebounds, 12.2 assists). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rondo had several monster statistical games including a 10 rebound, 21 assist game in a home win over the Warriors, but maybe the most impressive part of “Playoff Rondo” has been the leadership that he showed as one of the few veterans with championship experience on the roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was often seen calling out plays and defensive adjustments from the bench as well as standing up for his teammates and not backing down to players like Draymond Green. Rajon Rondo is one of the most unique players in the NBA today and it is clear that he still has some good basketball left in the tank, so hopefully we will see more stellar play from him in the future.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Terry Rozier</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1233720072\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83057\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83061\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/terry-rozier/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=2048%2C1185&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1185\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Terry Rozier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=888%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83061\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117-1024x593.jpg?resize=888%2C514\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=1024%2C593&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Scary Terry” sounds like the title of a low-budget 80’s horror movie rather than an NBA player’s nickname. But it does stand true that there is nothing scarier than finding yourself guarding Rozier one-on-one in the open floor, just ask Eric Bledsoe (too soon?). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you wish to call him, Terry Rozier has stepped up in the absence of All-Star Kyrie Irving throughout these playoffs and been a must-watch player in his own right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His clutch shooting and his beef with Eric Bledsoe made numerous headlines as the understaffed Celtics took down the Bucks in a thrilling 7 game series. He followed that up by going up another level to slow down the red-hot Sixers and beat them in 5 games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scary Terry is averaging an astounding 18.2 points, 5.8 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game throughout the first two rounds, a substantial increase from his regular season averages of 11.3, 2.9, and 4.7.  Part of Rozier’s likeability comes from his exciting, fast-paced style of play, lights-out shooting (39.6% from three on 8 attempts per game), and his numerous highlight-reel finishes over helpless defenders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His attempts to embrace the outpour of admiration have only increased the magnitude of his legend among fans and if he ends up leading the Celtics to a possible NBA finals birth, “Scary Terry” might be a name that is forever inscribed into Celtics lore.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Santa Barbara is coming off a 6-5 walk-off victory against Cal State Bakersfield this past Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“The effort has been better the last few games even in some of those losses to Long Beach last weekend. The guys grinded out a good win on Tuesday and we will go as far as our pitching takes us,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Along with playing its conference rival, the Gauchos are still in a very good position to finish the season strong, as with seven games to go, they can make it appoint to finish above .500, something they did not do last season, and improve upon its current seventh-place standing in the conference.</p>\n<p>Historically, UCSB has played well against Cal Poly as it currently owns a 93-73-1 record against its rivals, however, in the Andrew Checketts era, Santa Barbara has gone just 7-15 and has lost six straight to date.</p>\n<p>“We have not played well against them the last few times and traditionally their place is a tough place to play at but we have to show up and execute it does not matter who is on the other side of the dugout, we want to play our best baseball,” Checketts said. “We compete against each other in all facets of the game including recruiting so we do have that healthy rivalry and we want to win.”</p>\n<p>In order to not only just take one game from the Mustangs this weekend, but hopefully the whole series, the Gauchos will need excellent pitching performances from each of their starters and even their bullpen guys.</p>\n<p>In a 12-0 loss against LBSU on Saturday, starter right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln was rocked as he allowed six hits and seven runs in just 2.2 innings pitched. To be fair to the sophomore, he was coming off a nagging back injury he sustained the week before.</p>\n<p>This week, Lincoln will look to get back to form as his match against LBSU was definitely not the norm coaches and fans have come to expect from him.</p>\n<p>“He couldn’t land his off-speed pitches for strikes and he was fat in the middle of the plate when he was behind the count so that’s a recipe for a bad start,” Checketts said. “He hasn’t had a stinker before that so I am looking forward to seeing him bounce back and respond.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will also need more meaningful contributions from the bullpen guys as junior Kevin Chandler has a 5.54 ERA in 15 appearances, freshman Chris Troye has a 4.82 ERA in 16 appearances and junior Alex Patterson has a 3.82 ERA in 21 appearances.</p>\n<p>In a Friday start, senior Stevie Ledesma had a solid outing and handed the bullpen an 8-4 lead but the Gauchos were unable to hold on losing the game 9-8. Games like this are what drives fans and the team crazy.</p>\n<p>This weekend in particular, the Gaucho pitching staff will have their work cut out for them as they are going up against a Cal Poly team that currently owns the best batting average (.273), slugging percentage (.375) and second-best on-base percentage (.408) in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Along with owning the conference’s best batting average, the Mustangs also have two of the top-five best hitters in the conference.</p>\n<p>Outfielder Alex McKenna owns a .347 batting average which is the second-best in the Big West to go along with 30 RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Catcher Nick Meyer has the fourth best batting average in the conference with a .333 percentage. Infielder Tate Samuelson has the most runs batted in with 37.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, this weekend is all about continuing the uphill trend.</p>\n<p>With an even overall record and much room for improvement, this team still has a lot to play for and while this season will not result in the National Championship, it could be what the team looks back on a year from now as to what made a dream run in the NCAA Tournament possible.</p>\n<p>“Going to Omaha is not always a one-year process, sometimes it is a three, four, five-year process if we want to get back there and we can’t wait until next fall because we want to go about everything the right way. We need to play with the mentality that we want to have next spring now,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will take on Cal Poly for game one of a three-game set at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 18 at Robin Baggett Stadium.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

During that span, Santa Barbara picked up road victories over No.49 Washington and No.50 Loyola Marymount.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Gauchos were dominant in Big West play, easily winning their fourth straight conference title and accomplishing the goal that Davis set for them at the beginning of the season. The team also set a Big West record by winning their conference games of a combined score of 43-0.</p>\n<p>“The perfect score line in conference play is unbelievable, and a record that will never be topped,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>This team also once again established something that avid college tennis fans have long known: they have one of the best fan bases on the entire west coast. Propelled behind a raucous crowd at every home match, the Gauchos finished the season 11-0 at home — their second time going undefeated at home in the last three years.</p>\n<p>“The undefeated streak at home is a testament to our wonderful fans, many of whom made it up to SLO for our match with Cal Poly and to USC last Saturday,” Davis said. “The energy and atmosphere they provide is critical to the success we’ve enjoyed.”</p>\n<p>Individually, UCSB also experienced breakout seasons from many of their unproven players. Perhaps the most impressive example is sophomore Joseph Guillin. After transferring from Florida, Guillin started the season at the No.4 spot on the court, slowly climbing his way up as far as the No.1 spot. Overall, he finished the season with a 19-2 record, including seven wins out of his last eight matches.</p>\n<p>Krustev also left his mark in his first year: Despite not joining the team until January, Krustev finished 14-6 in singles play, and he and Guillin combined for an 11-4 record in doubles play on court three.</p>\n<p>On the top courts, the Gauchos once again received steady contributions from junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and senior captain Simon Freund.</p>\n<p>On court one, Moreno De Alboran went 15-5 on the season, winning his last eight matches on the season. His dominance during conference play also earned him the Big West Player of the Year Award, as well as a spot at the singles NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>Freund finished his career in fashion, winning his last ten matches in a row and finishing with an overall singles record of 17-5.</p>\n<p>In addition, Freund was nominated for the Arthur Ashe Leadership and Sportsmanship Award, while Moreno de Alboran was nominated for the ITA Player to Watch Award.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the future, the Gauchos will return all of their starters except for Freund, priming them to be even more dominant next season.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, however, the team will enjoy all they have accomplished this season.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of the way this team represented our university, our alumni and our former team members … both on and off the court,” Davis said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 17th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

‘Chos rolled over a sliding Cal Poly squad to close out their rough season on a high note. UCSB bested the Mustangs in games one and two of the series by scores of 10-9 and 5-4 respectively before ultimately dropping the series finale to Cal Poly with a 5-1 loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished the year with 20 wins and 34 losses, a disappointing downfall after the 31-28 season that the Gauchos completed during the 2017 season. Not only did the Gauchos lose 63% of its games this season, but UCSB finished in the eighth and final place of the Big West Conference with a 7-14 conference record, coming out on top in only one third of interleague contests.</p>\n<p>With the series loss, Cal Poly dropped to 25-25 overall, 9-12 in conference play to finish in the fifth spot in the Big West Conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although the shadow hanging over Santa Barbara’s season may be gloomy, UCSB looked fairly dominant in its final series of the 2018 season.</p>\n<p>The series opener slipped in the Gaucho’s favor after huge run production in the sixth and seventh innings to send the contest into extra innings. Some late-game heroics by junior shortstop Melanie Menor drove in the winning run on a walk off single in the bottom of the ninth inning to win a 10-9 standoff as the infamous Blue-Green Rivalry kicked off for the final time this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara carried over this momentum into the Saturday doubleheader and managed to perform on a supreme level in the first game of the day as the Gauchos displayed overwhelming power at the plate that has been lacking for much of the year.</p>\n<p>A first inning 3 RBI double by sophomore first baseman Hailey Martin propelled the Mustangs out in front early, but junior second baseman Sierra Altmeyer had an immediate answer come her first plate appearance of the day.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer responded with a 3-run jack of her own to even up the game at 3-3, her seventh bomb of the year.</p>\n<p>Complimented by a solo shot by sophomore center fielder Rayna Cohen, the Gauchos were tied at 4 runs a piece heading into the bottom of the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Boosted by a walk-off single in game one of the series, UCSB felt confident with their cleanup hitter stepping up to the dish with 2 outs in the final inning of play.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer blasted her team-best 8th long ball of the 2018 season to walk-off Santa Barbara in dramatic fashion with a 5-4 win and pull out the team’s first series win since mid-April. This homerun marks UCSB’s third walk-off hit in conference play on the year.</p>\n<p>The second base standout has turned it on in the final stretch of the season going 4-9 in the last series of the year with 2 deep bombs and 5 RBIs as she improved her batting average to .323 in her third season with Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos raked senior ace Lindsey Chalmers on two appearances over the weekend as she longed for the ever-coveted 20-win mark. The only thing standing in her way was the hidden power displayed from UCSB bats.</p>\n<p>Chalmers was limited to 8.2 innings pitched over two starts and allowed 11 runs in the process. She finished with an 8.99 ERA over the course of the three-game series dropping her holistic season earned run average to 2.57 as she was unable to come up victorious in either of her two starts. The righty ended the season with 19 wins and 9 losses, nonetheless good for second most wins in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While the first two games decided the outcome of the series winner, Cal Poly didn’t complacently lay down in the team’s season finale.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out firing as Rayna Cohen drove in sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez to thrust ahead in the bottom of the first inning.</p>\n<p>From there, both offenses remained silent until Poly erupted for a 5-run fourth inning which caused sophomore southpaw Felisha Noriega to see her day come to an end.</p>\n<p>For the next 3.1 innings, junior right-handed pitcher Veronika Gulvin maintained composure by allowing only 1 hit in her final appearance of the year.</p>\n<p>Gulvin hasn’t particularly lived up to each and every expectation this season, yet this past weekend she shined bright and previewed some special talent that we look forward to seeing next season. The junior threw 6.2 innings over two appearances against the Mustangs allowing only 1 run throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>Although Gulvin was dominant, she didn’t receive much help from the offense as UCSB dropped its final game of the series by a score of 5-1.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitching struggled immensely this year as three of the four active pitchers culminated their seasons with ERAs over 5.0.</p>\n<p>Yet the future is bright for UCSB! We saw promising performances from many young and well-rounded players. Freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian finished off her year with a team-best .335 batting average and displayed sheer and dominant speed early in the season. I would love to see more aggressive baserunning in conference play from Fabian since finished fourth in stolen bases in the Big West, although all of the steals came prior to Big West play.</p>\n<p>Inversely, freshman infielder Maci Fines was unreal come conference play. She started out the year batting roughly .229 in the former half of the season, but once she started to compete with Big West teams, the third baseman began to produce at exponentially high levels. She hit a near .400 in Big West play which rose her batting average on the year to .290.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also have young help in the circle. Freshman pitcher Emily Schuttish came alive in the latter half of the season as she was the go-to starter for conference play. Her most prominent month of starts came during April in which UCSB saw a rise in strikeouts per 7 innings from 3.72 to 4.70. Schuttish only saw .1 innings worth of time in the circle during May and we saw a destructive increase in ERA as it rose from 3.81 in April to 8.08 in May.</p>\n<p>There should be more of Schuttish next season as the ace on this Gaucho team. Hopefully, the soon-to-be second year compliments the other young batters well enough to improve on the 34-loss season.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, its essential for junior second baseman Sierra Altmeyer and sophomore first baseman Alyssa Diaz to assume a major leadership role over the offseason and take control of this team to smoothly usher in the younger players.</p>\n<p>Both infielders have a distinguishable leadership role on the team and must continue to push the rest of their Gaucho squad in order to improve in seasons to come.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/","id":1270,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1269,1268,1267],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB In Must-Win Situation, Heads To Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Baseball_vs_USC-040317-AngieBanks-02.5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Baseball_vs_USC-040317-AngieBanks-02.5-web.jpg?resize=942%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As they head into the latter part of the conference season the Gauchos now find themselves in a must-win situation if they hope to advance into postseason play.

On the year, Lincoln’s 2.35 ERA is the third-best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>At the plate, sophomore Tommy Jew has been as hot as anyone, as he still has the best batting average on the team with a .301.</p>\n<p>However, if the Gauchos want sustained success it needs bigger contributions from guys like sophomore Armani Smith, who has done a lot better as of late.</p>\n<p>One point batting under .200 on the year, Smith is now batting .221 and since April 22 has gone 9 for 23 at the plate with 10 RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Despite his struggles this year, it’s clear Smith is still very much putting in the effort — a sign of good things to come.</p>\n<p>“He’s hit for more power on the year with more doubles and homers, but he has also struck out more,” Checketts said. “He’s swung the bat better lately, and he’s a kid you root for. He’s a great kid so we are happy to see that.”</p>\n<p>Like Santa Barbara, Long Beach State is also 7-8 in conference play and tied for sixth place, but they seem to have more confidence due to their four-game winning streak. Overall, the Dirtbags boast a 22-26 record on the year.</p>\n<p>In their last four wins, LBSU has won by an average of 3.5 runs.</p>\n<p>At the plate this season, Long Beach State currently has the worst batting average in the entire league, sporting a .243 average, but in the last four games has managed a much better .315 at the dish.</p>\n<p>The Dirtbags also have two players currently batting above .300 on the season, which is always a nice luxury to have. Even more impressive is one of those two players batting over .300, junior Clayton Andrews, is also the team’s star pitcher.</p>\n<p>Andrews currently sports a 2.58 ERA on the season which is the best mark on the team and fifth-best total in the conference while his 92 punchouts are the second best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>This is the Rohnert Park native’s first season with the team; before this he spent two years playing at Cabrillo College where he was awarded with the league’s player of the year honors.</p>\n<p>In his last start against UC Riverside Saturday, Andrews had a career day as he went registered four hits, tying his career high, with one RBI and struck out a career-high 13 batters in eight innings of work.</p>\n<p>Due to his pitching performance, Andrews earned Player of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be a tough one for the Gauchos, but at the end of the day, if they even want a chance to make the postseason, they need to win.</p>\n<p>This team has grown a lot over the year, and no matter what happens, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p>“There has been some growth and maturity with this team through our failures, and these next two weeks are going to be very challenging, but we have talent here. We just have to play hard, quality baseball, not worry about that outside stuff and we will be fine,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on LBSU for game one at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 11 at Blair Field.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 10</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The only victory for the Gauchos on that day came from freshman Victor Krustev, although senior captain Simon Freund, sophomore Joseph Guillin and junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran all pushed their opponents to three sets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Santa Barbara has developed into a much more consistent team as the season has worn on. Moreno de Alboran has won 11 of his last 12 matches and was recently named the Big West Player of the Year. In addition, Freund and Guillin were named All-Big West first team singles. In particular, Guillin has shown significant growth as the season has worn on, finishing the season 19-2 despite moving his way up to the two spot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USC remained fairly dominant throughout the entirety of the season, finishing the season 8-3 at home. Their only two conference losses of the season came against UCLA, who is currently ranked No.1 in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will likely have to depend on their singles players more than usual, as USC has been nearly unbeatable in doubles play this year. On court one, they are 17-5 on the season, while on court two they are 17-4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the more intriguing matchups between the two sides will be the match between Moreno de Alboran and USC sophomore Brandon Holt, who is currently the No.10-ranked singles player in the country. When the two first met, Holt eked out a victory in three sets — a trend Moreno de Alboran will surely look to reverse this go around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Guillin will have his hands full on court two, as he will be matched up against No.74 freshman Daniel Cukierman, who has a 13-5 record at the No. 2 spot. If the Gauchos hope to keep up with the high-powered Trojan team, they will likely have to pull off an upset in at least one of those matchups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where USC is more vulnerable, however, is at the lower court spots.

The Mustangs are riding a momentous wave of pride after defeating No. 17 Cal State Fullerton, the leaders in the Big West conference, 3-0 last Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They currently rank fourth in conference, winning eight out of the 18 total games so far. Though they lost their latest series, their performance this weekend put the team at a 24-23 overall record, pushing their game percentage over the .500  mark. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, the Gauchos have no reason not to leave everything out on the field on Friday and Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With combined efforts from stand-out Big West players like Maci Fines, Sammy Fabian and Emily Schuttish, Santa Barbara has the potential to finally turn the tide for themselves. The three freshmen threaten opponents from all directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fines’s and Fabian’s combined success at the plate totals 43 hits so far; that translates to just below a third of the hits produced by the nine-person lineup in conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the mound, Schuttish has proven to have matured immensely since Big West play came around, even when the games ended up being devastating losses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her latest appearance happened against former competitor UC Riverside, whose 13 runs admittedly threw a wrench into her mojo last Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the games she has thrown all seven innings, however, the pitcher has held opponents to five runs or less. She holds onto the lowest in-conference ERA in the SB bullpen at 4.42. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, though, it would be unfair to leave out Cal Poly’s contributions to this equation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s “low” 4.42 ERA exceeds that of three out of four of the SLO’s pitchers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior powerhouse Lindsey Chalmers will undoubtedly bring the heat should she face SB this weekend. The right-handed vet boasts a 19-9 pitching record while keeping her ERA down low at 2.24 overall and at an even lower 1.39 in conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her consistent success earned her back-to-back Big West Conference Pitcher of the Week awards, the first a result of Chalmers’s first no-hitter. She beat out Santa Barbara’s Felisha Noriega that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether or not Cal Poly throws Chalmers or not, Santa Barbara’s offense must be alive and ready to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Santa Barbara typically produces the baserunners they need, their efforts at the plate lately have not extended to producing the runs needed to win. However, their failure to close out games is also due to the lack of consistency in the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the onset of the season in February, there have been just nine games in which the Gauchos have gone error-free. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past two series alone, UCSB committed 14 defensive mistakes, and while this is by no means entirely to blame for their recent losses, it does take a big toll on the team’s success rate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tightening up the defensive game can especially play a crucial role against a team like Cal Poly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though its offense is consistent enough to turn out wins, its game records reveal a very low-scoring pattern. In only one of the Mustangs’ eight wins in Big West so far have they scored more than five runs against an opponent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comparatively, though they have won only five games, SB scored above five runs in three of those five wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has the drive, the capability, the potential for success; it has peaked on the field and at the plate all season. And though the end of the season crept quickly behind the shadows of loss after loss, Friday and Saturday grant the Gauchos a final attempt at proving themselves as fierce competitors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes their closing series back home to Santa Barbara at Campus Diamond beginning Friday at 3 p.m. followed by a double header on Saturday starting at 1 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>After losing the first game by two in an exciting 13-11 loss, the Gauchos seemed lost out on the field in the last two games. They seemed to let the 9-3 loss yesterday affect their play, as they came out of the gates Sunday seemingly unprepared to face a newly confident Highlander team.</p>\n<p>Right off the bat, the Gauchos seemed to be outmatched. After the Gauchos only got one hit in the first inning, the Highlanders came out ready to swing, getting three hits, one short of UCSB’s total on the day.</p>\n<p>The three hits helped bring in a run, and Hannah Rodriquez also came home off of a wild pitch. After a second inning where the Highlanders scored two runs off of a double by Hannah Rodriquez double, the Gauchos were still within striking distance. However, the Highlanders put the game away in the bottom of the third.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the Gauchos still scoreless, the Highlanders started to roll, and circled through their whole rotation while also bringing in 6 runs. From there, both sides seemed to sense the inevitability of the contest, and two innings later, it was over.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders were buoyed by their starting pitcher Taylor Misfeldt, who allowed only 4 hits on her way to earn her 17th win on the season, the most on her team.</p>\n<p>On the Gaucho side, sophomore Felisha Noriega took the start for the day. Unfortunately, she didn’t get very far, letting up 4 runs in the first and second inning, and was relieved by junior Veronika Gulvin. With this loss, Felisha dropped below .500, going 6-7 on the year.</p>\n<p>The substitutions didn’t fare much better, as both Veronika and her replacement, senior Lena Mayer, let up 5 runs. Veronika was pulled during the third inning, after her fifth run came in on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>With Lena now pitching in the bottom of the third, she let up a wild pitch, which brought in a run, but was able to end the inning. However, she let up an additional four more runs in the fourth inning, and with head coach Brie Galicinao electing not to put in any more pitchers, Lena ended the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, there weren’t many bright spots for the Gauchos. One of the lone positives for the Gauchos was sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez, who continued to swing well, getting two hits. However, with 6 of her Gaucho teammates going hitless, the offense was absent.</p>\n<p>For the Highlanders, no one individual stood out, but the team as a whole hit well. Three people had two hit games, and four people had two runs. Danielle Ortega did seem to shine brightest amongst the stars, with a triple in the third inning that cleared three runs in and seemed to seal the game. The Highlanders were simply much more potent on offense, and the Gauchos did not seem to have an answer.</p>\n<p>Ending the series on a 14-0 loss, the Gauchos hope to recover against Cal Poly this weekend, where they play a Mustangs team that is 8-10 in conference play and coming off a Cal State Fullerton win. The Mustangs should get some confidence from that, considering that was only Fullerton’s second loss of Big West play.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly comes to UCSB this weekend, with the first game on Friday, and the doubleheader on Saturday. This will be the Gauchos last series of the year, and we’ll see if they can go out on a good note.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82950\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82950\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/","id":28,"author":{"id":258,"name":"Andrew Strauss"},"related":[27,26,25],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop First Two Games Against Heavy Hitting Highlanders","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2018-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball-042218-NicoleWallace-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball-042218-NicoleWallace-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Although the offense has picked up as of late for the Gauchos, they haven't been able to put together a strong defensive performance in a while.

Going 3 for 4 in the second game, the junior shortstop singled three times consequently producing three runs for her team.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez’s predecessor in the lineup Jenna Curtan similarly maximized her own time on offense. The centerfielder’s bat threatened Gaucho defense twice in her four turns at the plate with a double and a triple.</p>\n<p>UCR’s tenacity at the plate remained stable through both games, a quality that seems to consistently evade Santa Barbara. While UCSB practically matched UCR in hits, its inability to bring baserunners home brings a pivotal downfall to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>The first game of the day, however, illuminated a rarely-seen side of this lackluster offense. The Gauchos drove in 11 runs, their highest scoring win since facing Fordham way back in February.</p>\n<p>UCSB began and ended the game with home runs compliments of freshman and senior duo Maci Fines and Samantha Lujan.</p>\n<p>Lujan, who DP’d for the day, homered deep into left field with bases loaded in the sixth, setting up a potentially great comeback story as her team trailed then by only one run. Not only did the hit break her five-game dry streak, but it was also her first home run of the season.</p>\n<p>Fines matched Lujan’s 3 for 4 performance for the day in both the first and second games of the day.</p>\n<p>The shortstop has had an unbelievable offensive debut in her first Big West series. She holds an incredible .400 batting average, far surpassing her teammates, and has 22 hits in just the 17 conference games so far.</p>\n<p>By itself, the Gauchos offense should have been enough to secure a win for the team. So where, then, did they go wrong?</p>\n<p>By the second inning, SB lost their 4-0 lead as the UCR offense pounced on the momentum put forth by their competitor and scored a returning seven runs. The teams remained arm in arm throughout the game: as one side scored, the other matched it.</p>\n<p>Lasting almost three hours, the lagging game took one final toll on the team in the last inning. An error allowed the Highlanders one last run to which the Gauchos were not able to respond to in their at-bats.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara faces UC Riverside one more time on Sunday, May 6 at 1pm at Amy S. Harrison Field for a final shot at preventing a sweep on the weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-drop-first-two-games-against-heavy-hitting-highlanders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-drop-first-two-games-against-heavy-hitting-highlanders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-drop-first-two-games-against-heavy-hitting-highlanders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-drop-first-two-games-against-heavy-hitting-highlanders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-drop-first-two-games-against-heavy-hitting-highlanders/","id":1249,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[1248,1247,1246],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Roll Over Matadors Thanks to Dominant Pitching Display","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.05.21_StephenManga_Baseball-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.05.21_StephenManga_Baseball-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Behind a commanding pitching performance by senior Stephen Manga, the Gauchos steamrolled over the Northridge Matadors 12-0 on Saturday.

At the end of the first inning the Gauchos were up 2-0.</p>\n<p>The overall offensive explosion from UCSB was highlighted by three-run performances in the second, fifth, and eighth innings.</p>\n<p>A single from sophomore Armani Smith was able to move freshman Marcos Castanon to second base for freshman Andrew Martinez’s at-bat partially through the second inning. The designated hitter knocked a three-run blast to score Smith and Castanon, allowing Martinez to join a three player tie for the team season lead with five home runs.</p>\n<p>Junior Michael McAdoo piled onto the six-run lead in the fifth inning, hitting his own three-run home run to straightaway centerfield off of CSUN freshman Wesley Moore. A walk from junior Thomas Rowan and a center field single from Cole Mueller put them on first and second and the three RBIs for McAdoo was his second time this season. The lead increased to nine runs at the end of five innings.</p>\n<p>The final three-run inning for UCSB came in the eighth, with Castanon beginning the inning with a single to left center field. Smith came up to the plate a couple of batters later and hit a fly ball over the Matador center fielder’s head, who played a bad route to the ball. Castanon and freshman Jason Willow, who was hit by a pitch, would come around to score on Smith’s double to make the grand total 12-0.</p>\n<p>Ledesma was outstanding in his start for the Gauchos giving up six hits and getting seven strikeouts for the game’s duration. The 6-2 record for the starter is the best in the pitching rotation for UCSB, and tied for fourth in the Big West, and he has now picked up the victory in three consecutive starts.</p>\n<p>In a postgame interview, Ledesma commented on his successful day praising his defense saying, “If you’re getting strikes and guys are making plays behind you that makes throwing strikes so much easier because you don’t have to worry about balls in the holes that they’re not making plays on. Them making plays makes my job a lot more easier.”</p>\n<p>The complete game effort was Ledesma’s sixth quality start of the season as the pitcher has rarely failed to put in six full innings of work this year.</p>\n<p>The quantity of innings he has thrown is matched by the quality of his pitching as well, as Ledesma currently sits in second place in the conference in ERA with a stellar 2.16. The impressive performance from the senior was just his latest in a recent run that has seen him rise up in the ranks and look to be an effective tool for UCSB as they inch closer to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB Head Coach Andrew Checketts message to his team remains one of quiet persistence explaining, “For this particular group we’ve handled failure better than we’ve handled success … it’ll be another battle for us tomorrow and I’m looking forward to see their response. I want to see some intent with want they do and some maturity with how they go about their business from when they walk in the park”.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will play the final game of the series against the CSUN Matadors at home on Sunday, May 5 at 1 PM PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82946\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82946\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/","id":4282,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4281,4280,4279],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":30,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
