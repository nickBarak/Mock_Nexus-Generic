While road concerns have been a problem for Santa Barbara, the Gauchos have won both home games by an average margin of 18 points as they hope to continue the same trend tonight.</p>\n<p>“Right now, this young ball club hasn’t figured out to sustain when momentum starts against them on the road,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “At home, we haven’t had much of a problem with that — we’ve actually sustained pretty well.”</p>\n<p>Wyoming will try to win its seventh straight game tonight in an attempt to match its best start since the 1969-70 season. The Cowboys will embark on the road for only the second time this season, beating Northern Colorado 69-60 in their only other contest away from home. UCSB is certainly up to the challenge of facing an undefeated squad.</p>\n<p>“That adds a lot of motivation for us. We just want to go out and get that win even more now, break that run they’ve got,” freshman forward Taran Brown said. “We’re a lot more confident at home.”</p>\n<p>Brown has been on f ire for the Gauchos, averaging a team-high 15 points per game while second in rebounds with six. Williams, meanwhile, continues to be an imposing presence for Santa Barbara down low as he leads the team with over eight boards per game and is second in scoring with nearly 15 points per game.</p>\n<p>As the third youngest team in the nation, the Gauchos have struggled to remain consistent and tough from game to game, an issue they hope to resolve starting against Wyoming.</p>\n<p>“Everybody has watched the success that LSU and Illinois State, and now Boise State, have with just denying us, physically denying us,” Coach Williams said. “I expect them to be very physical with us, try to get into us and cause problems in doing that.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, UCSB allows nearly 70 points per game, a number that drops to under 50 when at home. The Cowboys average 67 points per game, reaching 60 or more points in every contest this year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get in there and be more physical, be tougher and change our mindset,” Alan Williams said. “We’re a really good team at home.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for tonight’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 28th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49058\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49058\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/","id":4494,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[4493,4492,4491],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Going the Extra Mile","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When Myles Christian entered UCSB as a talented freshman, many expected greatness from him.

Five years later, those expectations have come to fruition, as the senior goalkeeper exits as one of the all-time great water polo players in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>Christian will be graduating this year after five years of consistent production and leadership. He leaves UCSB ranked fourth in career saves with 607, and his 238 saves in his senior season are fourth all-time for single season saves at UCSB. Also in his senior season, Christian finished third in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with 11.61 saves per game and posted a career-best 19 saves on Oct. 21 at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“That game was definitely the highlight of my career, it was fun,” Christian said. “I would also say beating Stanford and UCLA in the SoCal tournament as some of the highlights of my career. That was huge for us; it really showed us what we were capable of doing even though we didn’t quite meet those expectations the rest of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In his five-year career, the Gauchos went a combined 74-63 and never finished higher than eighth in the national rankings. As a senior and one of the most experienced players on the team, Christian was named a team captain along with fellow senior Brian Shoemaker.</p>\n<p>“As far as his leadership, Myles leads by example and people really want to be around him,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “He has such a great work ethic. I think it really rubs off on his teammates.”</p>\n<p>However, Christian’s college career did not begin with stardom right away. In 2008, his first year at UCSB, Christian redshirted and then shared playing time during his freshman and sophomore seasons with upperclassman Fraser Bunn.</p>\n<p>“It was a good experience; Fraser was a really good goalie and I learned a lot from him,” Christian said. “It was nice to not have all of the pressure on me right away.”</p>\n<p>In 2009, his freshman year of eligibility, Christian made six starts and tallied 84 saves. In a 10-9 overtime loss to Loyola Marymount, Christian collected 15 saves which was at the time a career best.</p>\n<p>“Myles is definitely a leader not only in the pool, but all around,” junior guard Dylan Baliani said. “He works hard at everything he does. It’s not so much of what he says, but [what] he does. He is the perfect example of a guy who leads by example.”</p>\n<p>In his sophomore season, Christian appeared in 18 games for UCSB and accumulated 115 saves with 18 steals. Then in 2011, Christian got the full starting job and posted 170 saves with 25 steals to lead the team.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a great feeling when you get the starting job. I felt like by [2011], I had enough experience, and it wasn’t too much pressure so I could enjoy it everyday,” Christian said.</p>\n<p>Before he was a Gaucho, Christian was a stand-out at Newport Harbor High School where he received countless awards and honors. As a senior, Christian led the Sailors to a CIF Division I championship and was named to First Team All-Sunset League, First Team All-County, First Team All- CIF Division I and First Team All-American. With all that success, Christian garnered a lot of attention from college coaches.</p>\n<p>“The two main schools I was looking at were UCSB and Long Beach State,” Christian said. “There was some interest in going to somewhere like UCLA or USC, but they had a few goalies already and UCSB was lacking in that area. Then I came up on my recruiting trip and just immediately fell in love, how could you not? In the end it was an easy choice.”</p>\n<p>The fact that UCSB was the “easy choice” for Myles has made a lot of teammates and Gaucho fans happy. Many of them were eager to offer their thoughts and respect for Myles, who impresses in everything he does.</p>\n<p>“Myles was probably the best goalie in the country this past year, most of the goals that he allowed were the result of missed shot blocks and defensive mistakes,” sophomore attacker Derek Shoemaker said. “He was also a great captain and leader. He set up various team activities to keep us out of trouble and he was usually in charge of getting our team dinners as well. It’s almost as if he was another coach.”</p>\n<p>In his life after UCSB, Christian will be leaving water polo behind but will still be making saves. However, these saves will not be of potential goals, but of human lives.</p>\n<p>“I’m graduating in the spring and right now I’m working as an EMT with the Santa Barbara County Fire Department so I’ll have that job until I graduate,” Christian said. “Then I am looking to stay up here and go to the fire academy and hopefully become a firefighter here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>In his final comments, Christian offered some lasting pieces of advice and leadership for the rest of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Work together, always support each other,” Christian said. “They have so much talent.

However, USC used excellent passing to find the open man on a Santa Barbara defense that typically ranks No. 20 nationally in three-point defense at 20.3 percent.</p>\n<p>“That’s not our personality to play a lot of zone,” Mitchell said. “They haven’t shot it extremely well in their first four games, so we thought we might mix it up a little bit more than usual.That’s always a chance you take.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were especially undersized with their two centers, senior Kirsten Tilleman and freshman Jessica Pino, sitting on the sidelines with injuries.</p>\n<p>“Well I think it’s obvious [not having them] made a major impact,” Mitchell said. “Tilleman [averages] eight rebounds a game, so that put the burden on Lei and Sweets, who had to guard a powerful post presence on the low block.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB made the end interesting, bringing the game within just six points with 1:19 remaining. However, the Trojans answered with none other than a three-pointer, icing the game.</p>\n<p>“I felt we didn’t come out in the first half the way we needed to,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said. “We needed to redeem ourselves and play hard [in the second half ].”</p>\n<p>To start the game, UCSB jumped out to an early 18-17 lead. However, USC put together a 20-4 run to end the first half and begin the second half to give the team a 37-22 lead.</p>\n<p>“They were taking a lot of switches in everything we were running with screen and rolls, which is a major part of our offense,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t recognize the times of mismatches and I think we hit the panic button a little too quickly, so sometimes we were taking quick shots and should’ve executed a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Aguirre and freshman forward Kendra Morrison led the charge with Morrison tallying 11 points on the game, all of which came in the second half. Aguirre put the team on her back in the final period, running the point and scoring 11 of her 13 points.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to do anything I could to help us win and get back into the game, so I guess today that meant scoring points,” Aguirre said. “Any way I can help our team win is what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Saturday against St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 28th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/","id":704,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[703,702,701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Spends Thanksgiving in Mexico","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB might be heading to paradise for Thanksgiving break, but this trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico won’t be about sunbathing for the women’s basketball team as they play some tough competition in ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB might be heading to paradise for Thanksgiving break, but this trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico won’t be about sunbathing for the women’s basketball team as they play some tough competition in the 2012 Hardwood Tournament of Hope, beginning with Oregon State today.</p>\n<p>“I’m very excited,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We took one trip to New York my freshman year, which was awesome.

Despite taking a 12-point lead into the second half, the Gauchos found themselves up just two with five seconds remaining. Nevertheless, UCSB was able to close out the win.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take away closing games out when it’s really close,” Nesbit said. “At this point last season, we probably wouldn’t have been able to do that.”</p>\n<p>The greatest challenge for the Gauchos against the Beavers may turn out to be something UCSB has no control over: height. Oregon St. is a big team; the average height of its starting lineup is 6’0’’ compared to Santa Barbara’s 5’9’’.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB will need to keep Oregon St. out of the paint. The Beavers average 36 points in the paint per game.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re undersized just about every game,” Mitchell said. “Our defensive philosophy remains the same. The only way you can handle 6’4’’ is to full front them and pressure the ball.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding will be another focus point for UCSB as Oregon St. averages an incredible 50 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“[We have to] box them out … that’s the main thing,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We have to really put a body on them, drive them back and secure each and every rebound.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos will keep a close eye on Oregon St. sharpshooter Alyssa Martin. The junior guard averages 18 points per game, shooting 44.4 percent from the field. She shoots an even higher percentage from behind the arc at 45.5 percent and has solidified herself as one of the best three-point shooters in the team’s history, ranking sixth all time in threes with 100.</p>\n<p>“She can shoot the three or can put it on the floor,” Mitchell said. “She finds a variety of ways to score, which for us, is probably going to be a matchup problem.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB will need to improve its execution against a zone, especially since the Beavers are known for their two-three zone. In UCSB’s last game against New Mexico St., the Gauchos were outscored 27-17 in the second half when the Aggies switched to a zone.</p>\n<p>“We know that’s probably our biggest weakness right now as a team,” Nesbit said. “We need to execute, not be afraid of the zone, be patient and attack.”</p>\n<p>Depending on today’s result, the Gauchos will face off against either Mississippi State or Winthrop tomorrow. Other teams in the tournament include Louisville, University of Central Florida, Gonzaga and Missouri State University.</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Oregon State is set for 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 20th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/","id":702,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[701,700,699],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Gain First Win in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After two losses to begin the season, the UCSB men’s basketball team recorded its first win of the season with an 80-60 victory against The Master’s College Saturday night at the Thunderdome.

The Mustangs, however, were able to stay in the game with six three-pointers and trailed UCSB 39-30 going into the half.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara went on a 21-7 run in the span of 10 minutes to increase the lead to 68-47 in the second half. After scoring only two points in the first half, Brown settled into an offensive flow, making seven shots from the field, including 4-6 from three- point range, en route to recording his first double-double of his collegiate career.</p>\n<p>“Every game I’m just starting to feel a little better out there and just really try to focus what coach has been telling me,” Brown said. “[Coach has said] to get out there and rebound, and knock down open shots and just really ‘D’ up. It’s starting to pay off a little bit.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued wearing down the Mustangs on the boards, holding a 50- 31 advantage in the game. Brown had a career-high 13 rebounds to lead the team while Williams recorded 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I did an okay job on rebounds, couple of them I should’ve had that I couldn’t get a hand on. I’m just going to go back and work on that,” Williams said. “Rebounding is going to be a really big key and I’ve got to go out there and rebound really hard.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also received excellent play from its point guards, as senior Nate Garth and sophomore T.J. Taylor combined to shoot 8-9 from the field, including 3-4 from behind the arc. The two helped dish out 10 assists while committing only one turnover.</p>\n<p>“We get 22 points from our point guard position; we didn’t get 22 points in five games combined from our point guard position last year,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “It was really a good sign, and for the most part, they were all really good shots.”</p>\n<p>After turning the ball over 41 times combined in their first two games, the Gauchos only had 13 turnovers and limited The Master’s College to only 38 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts San Diego on Wednesday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 19th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48999\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-gain-win-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48999\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-gain-win-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-gain-win-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-gain-win-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-gain-win-home-opener/","id":701,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[700,699,698],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Two on Road to Snap Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team needed every possible set to win its two games this weekend against UC Riverside Friday and Cal State Fullerton Saturday, with both games going the full five sets.

On Saturday evening, UCSB dominated the first set, hitting .333 and committing just one error. Fullerton hit negative .022 in the first set and lost 25-13.</p>\n<p>“After the first game we had to make sure we didn’t let up. I think during the first game we were all having fun and we didn’t put pressure on ourselves,” freshman libero Taylor Formico said. “We were just playing our game and not making mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara then took a 2-0 lead after winning the second set 25-21, but could not finish off the Titans that easily. Fullerton battled back to win sets three and four 25-18 and 25-20, respectively. In the final set, Santa Barbara jumped to an early 3-2 lead and never let up. Freshman middle blocker Britton Taylor recorded the game-winning kill to seal the victory 15-12.</p>\n<p>Taylor hit .455 on the night and was one of three Gauchos with double-digit kills. Junior outside hitter Leah Sully led the team with 20 kills. The Titans’ senior outside hitter Kayla Neto recorded a match-high 23 kills on the night in her final home game at Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>On Friday night in Riverside, UCSB came out on top, ending its four-game losing streak. Riverside fell to 7-22 on the year and 1-14 in the Big West. Santa Barbara won the first set in a closely contested 25-23 game. The Highlanders, however, took the following two sets to lead on the night two games to one.</p>\n<p>“After we were down, we came together as a team between every point, which is really important,” Formico said. “Our mistakes really beat us in the first two games, so we just had to limit our errors. Once we did that, we played a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Riverside was unable to capitalize on the lead, opening the door for UCSB to fight back. In the fourth set, with the score tied 18-18, Sully put the ball away, giving Santa Barbara a 19-18 lead.

Junior outside hitters Leah Sully and Katey Thompson led the Gauchos with 15 kills each while freshman middle blocker Britton Taylor recorded 12 kills of her own.</p>\n<p>“[Riverside] never quits and they play every team hard. We are going to try and make them pass badly so that they are out of system,” freshman libero Taylor Formico said. “We’re going to try to shut down their outside Ashley Cox, who has been doing really well. We think if we serve tough and pass well, our offense will come along and we‘ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Riverside was led by senior outside hitter Amanda Vialpando, who scored 20 kills along with 20 digs on the night. Freshman outside hitter Ashley Cox put up 16 kills as well as 25 digs, tops for the Highlanders on the night.</p>\n<p>Cox and Vialpando rank at No. 7 and 8 on the Big West kills leader board and will be key players for UCSB to keep its eyes on.</p>\n<p>“We know not to take [Riverside] lightly,” Formico said. “Although their record isn’t very good they did just beat Irvine and have been doing well.”</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s match against Cal State Fullerton, UCSB will have to overcome a team that will be playing with plenty of emotion and wanting to send its seniors out with a victory on senior night. One of those seniors will be standout outside hitter Kayla Neto.</p>\n<p>In the last meeting between UCSB and Fullerton, the Titans left the Thunderdome victorious after five close sets.</p>\n<p>“I’ve tried to explain that we cannot lose [Neto] no matter where she is on the court,” Gregory said. “When you least expect them to set her they will set her.”</p>\n<p>Neto recorded 20 digs and a career-high 35 kills last time out against UCSB. She currently ranks second in the Big West with 4.35 kills per set and 474 total kills.</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara last time out against Fullerton was Formico with 41 digs. Sully and junior outside hitter Kara Sherrard each posted solid stat lines with 20 and 16 kills respectively, but it was not enough to overcome Neto and the rest of the Titans.</p>\n<p>“[Neto] can hit all the corners of the court, but her favorite spot is zone one, where our weakest defense is,” Gregory said. “We have tried to practice and are cheating people over to that area.”</p>\n<p>The last road trip of the year for the Gauchos will begin tonight in Riverside’s SRC Arena at 7 p.m. Then, on Saturday UCSB will take on Fullerton in Titan Gym at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November 16, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/gauchos-set-final-road-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/gauchos-set-final-road-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/gauchos-set-final-road-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/gauchos-set-final-road-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/gauchos-set-final-road-trip/","id":5370,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5369,5368,5367],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Plays in Final Home Match Against Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 7 UCSB men’s water polo team hosts No. 6 Long Beach State this Saturday for their final regular season Mountain Pacific Sports Federation game of the year.

Also, I have just been trying to work as hard as possible for these last few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Matt Gronow is another option.

While the Gauchos were certainly able to score the ball, defense was a major concern for the team and a main point of emphasis in practice this week.</p>\n<p>“What we take away is that it exposed a lot of weaknesses,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “It got the team’s attention, the coaching staff ’s attention. We’re all very aware of where we need to improve and where the weaknesses are.”</p>\n<p>In Masters College, UCSB faces an NAIA opponent entering the game with a 3-1 record. The Mustangs host UC Merced Friday before traveling to take on a Gaucho squad that has won its last 11 regular season home openers.</p>\n<p>“The guys should be hungry to get back out there and play,” Coach Williams said. “It’s important for us to go out and gain some confidence and make some improvements in some areas where we were very dissatisfied in.” One of those areas the Gauchos feel they</p>\n<p>must address is turnovers. “With the talent level we have, we can</p>\n<p>score the ball. But when you turn it over 23 times at LSU and 20 times at Illinois State, you can’t win many games like that,” Boswell said. “We’ve just got to take care of the ball and find times to be aggressive offensively, and then I feel like the offense will come.”</p>\n<p>Boswell led UCSB in scoring against LSU with 17 points, while sophomore center Alan Williams recorded 14 points and a team-high six rebounds. Williams recorded a double-double for Santa Barbara against Illinois State with 15 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We’re a really talented offensive unit. We’ve got a lot of guys that can go out there and score,” Al Williams said. “But if we can’t stop anybody and can’t take care of the ball, we won’t be able to use that to our advantage.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara features seven freshmen who figure to receive consistent playing time, with freshman forward Taran Brown leading the group thus far, putting forth career-highs with 22 points and six assists against Illinois State.</p>\n<p>“He was much better, he got into a little rhythm and he became a much more efficient offensive player,” Coach Williams said. “We know what he is capable of, so it’s really good to see him break out and score like that.”</p>\n<p>Despite starting the season with two losses, UCSB can now address those areas of concern in practice and in the upcoming games before conference play.</p>\n<p>“We were extremely disappointed in our effort defensively. We have to get way more physical, way more disciplined,” Coach Williams said. “We’re just going to have to spend a lot of extra time in practice defensively for the next three weeks to a month.”</p>\n<p>Masters College meanwhile averages over 70 points per game in its four contests, a number UCSB will look to drastically cut down on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We go out there and treat them like a D-1 opponent every time,” Al Williams said.“We game plan for them the same way, we scout them the same way, we really go out there and treat it like it’s a division one basketball game. In all honesty, if we take that L, it’s a bad loss.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday’s home opener is set for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 4 of November 16, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48978\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-win-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48978\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-win-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-win-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-win-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-win-home-opener/","id":700,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[699,698,697],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB To Play Aggies in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team looks for its first win of the season tonight when the team plays in its home opener against New Mexico State.

While the Gauchos outshot the Aggies from the field 50 to 40 percent, New Mexico was on fire from behind the arc, hitting 8-13 threes.</p>\n<p>“Most of the time, their threes came when we went to a three-two matchup zone,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Hopefully, we’re a little more advanced in our half court man and we don’t have to rely on the zone.”</p>\n<p>UCSB should match up well against New Mexico, which plays a four-guard lineup. Not only is UCSB deep in the guard department, but the Gauchos should also see a rare height advantage.</p>\n<p>“On the offensive end, if we ever have a height advantage — because that doesn’t happen very often — we need to take advantage of that when it’s there,” Tilleman said.</p>\n<p>The inside-out game will be crucial for UCSB. Last year, the Gauchos outscored the Aggies 20-10 in paint buckets.</p>\n<p>“We have to find a way to get a post player involved in double-figure scoring,” Mitchell said. “We understand that’ll make Nic and Mel’s lives a bit easier if they can get some open jumpers, but the only way to do that is if we’ve established an inside presence early on in the game.”</p>\n<p>One of those guards UCSB will keep a close eye on is senior Stefanie Gilbreath, a transfer from USC. In the Aggies’ exhibition game, Gilbreath scored 26 points in 23 minutes on 10-14 shooting.</p>\n<p>“[We’ll] change it up on her and give her different bodies,”Mitchell said.“Great players, a lot of times, will find ways to get their points, but you have to be cautious of letting other people get involved and scoring above their averages.”</p>\n<p>In New Mexico’s first game of the season against Loyola Marymount, the Lions shut down Gilbreath, holding her to 12 points on 3-15 shooting, but her teammates picked up the slack. Redshirt senior forward Kelsie Rozendaal tallied 22 points and 11 boards while sophomore guard Danesia Williamson contributed 19 points in the 77-76 victory.</p>\n<p>In the end, the game may come down to tempo. The Aggies want to score, averaging 78.5 points per game. The Gauchos, on the other hand, would like the game to be determined on the defensive end. Known for its tenacious defense, UCSB has only averaged 52 points per game and will try to keep the two teams’ point totals much lower.</p>\n<p>“We play through our defense,” Tilleman said. “We need to get more aggressive; we were disappointed with our defense against UNLV. We need to not see a number or a player or a jersey and just play like we normally do.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Earning the biggest award for Santa Barbara was Ryan, who garnered the Big West Midfielder of the Year award. His first All-Big West honor of his career, Ryan is the third consecutive Gaucho to earn the award.</p>\n<p>Ryan tied for third in both goals and points, tallying eight goals and three assists for 19 points on the year, 12 of which came during Big West play. Ryan also ranked fourth in conference in game-winning goals with four.</p>\n<p>“I was extremely happy that Nic Ryan, a player who hasn’t gotten a whole lot of publicity and not a whole lot of people have talked about him, got Midfielder of the Year,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Ema Boateng took the Big West Freshman of the Year award after posting four goals and four assists, becoming the third player in the last four years to win the award for the Gauchos. He also tied for fifth in the Big West in game- winning goals with two.</p>\n<p>“We always knew that Ema was going to win the award,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “Usually freshmen don’t step in right away, but he helped us both offensively and defensively.”</p>\n<p>Three Gauchos made the All-Big West First Team: Ryan, Boateng and Baiden. Baiden started 17 of 19 games en route to his first league honor of his career. Playing a defensive mid, Baiden’s contributions may not show up in the box scores, but he was indispensable to UCSB, controlling the midfield, aiding the UCSB defense and allowing other players to push up.</p>\n<p>“I thought [Baiden] was our most consistent player all year,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s the one that makes things go for us, so it’s good that others recognized that he had a good season.”</p>\n<p>In his first year with UCSB, junior defender Daniel Welsh earned All-Big West Second Team honors. He started 17 games and was often responsible for guarding the opponent’s best attacker. With Welsh, the Gauchos tallied an impressive 0.90 goals- against average and five shutouts.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting he got Second Team,” Baiden said. “I thought we would make First Team, but it’s a new conference for him and he made his mark as a good defender. I see him being the defender of the year next year.”</p>\n<p>Finally, senior midfielder Josue Madueno earned an Honorable Mention pick for the second straight season. Madueno was just one of two players to play in every game this season and stepped up big when UCSB was plagued with injuries.</p>\n<p>“I think Josue deserved a little more,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s a great team guy and he played wherever we needed.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 15, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/","id":1618,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1617,1616,1615],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Squeaks Out Home Opening Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It was another close game for the UCSB women’s basketball team, but this time, the result was different as the team held on for a 43-41 victory over New Mexico State last night in the Thunderdome.

With the score at 11-9, junior guard Nicole Nesbit converted a three point play and sparked a 13-2 run to give the Gauchos a 24-11 lead. Santa Barbara finished the half up 26-14.</p>\n<p>“They were playing us man [defense],” Mitchell said. “We were going inside out. It’s a lot easier executing on a man defense because you know who you want to get the shot for.” Offensively, Santa Barbara looked solid</p>\n<p>in the first half, outshooting New Mexico State 43.5 to 21.4 percent. Nesbit was especially fiery in the first half, scoring 11 points, a mere three points less than the Aggies had in the half.</p>\n<p>“I felt really good in the first half,” Nesbit said. “My teammates were setting great screens and we were just running our normal offense, so it felt good to knock down some shots.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos controlled the first half, the second half told a different story as UCSB was outscored 27-17.</p>\n<p>The Aggies crawled back in the game little by little, going on two small 5-0 and 4-0 runs. Meanwhile, Santa Barbara struggled on the offensive end, shooting just 28.6 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“They went zone,” Mitchell said. “They went to a three-two [zone], high and wide most of the time. We’ll have to work on it.”</p>\n<p>With 1:41 remaining, senior forward Kelsie Rozendaal converted a three-point play, which brought the game to within three at 39-36.</p>\n<p>Then, sophomore guard Danesia Williamson knocked down a three with five seconds left to bring New Mexico State within two for the first time since the 13:23 mark in the first half. With little time remaining, the Aggies fouled Nesbit, who missed the one and one, but came up with a defensive strip as time expired.</p>\n<p>“Missing that last [free throw] … I was very frustrated,” Nesbit said. “I think I [then] took a little bit of a risk [on defense], but I was just worried about getting it back and not giving them a chance to get a shot off.”</p>\n<p>As usual, the defense for the Gauchos caused their opponent problems, holding a team that averaged 78.5 points in its first two games including an exhibition to 41.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also held New Mexico to just 1-14 from behind the arc, a much different result than last year’s 8-13 display by the Aggies when the two teams faced off. Meanwhile, UCSB shot 5-10 from downtown.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be next Tuesday in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico against Oregon State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 15, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48933\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48933\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/","id":698,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[697,696,695],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ryan Takes the Reins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In a season full of disappointment for the UCSB men’s soccer team, there was one major bright spot on the year: Nic Ryan. “I thought Nic Ryan had a breakout season,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg sai...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In a season full of disappointment for the UCSB men’s soccer team, there was one major bright spot on the year: Nic Ryan.</p>\n<p>“I thought Nic Ryan had a breakout season,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “He stepped up and was consistent.

Losing our forwards, it was huge to have someone to score goals for us.”</p>\n<p>Ryan seemed to come up with a goal whenever his team needed one. Against Cal Poly Oct. 19, he scored what may have been the most beautiful goal of the year for UCSB when he converted a diving header sent into the box from freshman midfielder Ema Boateng.</p>\n<p>He even single-handedly kept the Gauchos in the game on multiple occasions. Most notably, he scored both of UCSB’s goals in a 2-1 decision against UC Irvine Oct. 5, the second goal coming in double overtime with 24 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“Every goal he got was a key goal at a key moment,” Vom Steeg said. “You can’t ask for much more than what he gave us. I feel bad that we weren’t able to do enough to send [our seniors] off in a different away.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the San Jose native seemed to fly under the radar with the hype of the team centering on flashy players such as Boateng or senior midfielder Dion Acoff, who dazzled fans with their speed and footwork.</p>\n<p>Yet, that’s not the type of player Ryan is; he’s a player who effectively gets the job done. He knows where to be on the field, and most importantly, how to finish in front of the goal.</p>\n<p>“He understands the game really well and he knows where to be at the right time,” Baiden said. “It allowed him to get involved more and get himself in places that would score.”</p>\n<p>Despite being a player who hasn’t received a ton of publicity or made people talk, Ryan was recognized in a big way when he received the Big West Midfielder of the Year award last week.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to get an award after a difficult season,” Ryan said. “It was definitely one of my goals to try to be the best midfielder out there and getting it felt like a [big] accomplishment. It’s definitely a big award, and I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p>One of two players to play in every game this year for UCSB, Ryan tallied five goals and two assists during Big West play en route to his first All-Big West honor of his career.</p>\n<p>“In order to win that award, you have to play through the midfield, and we do that,” Vom Steeg said. “We ask them to be on the ball, and as a result, we allow them to really demonstrate what they can do. He seized the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Ryan keeps the Midfielder of the Year award in the family as he is the fourth consecutive Gaucho to win it. Danny Barrera took the honor in 2009-10 and Luis Silva won it last year.</p>\n<p>In fact, playing behind players such as Barrera, Silva and Sam Garza in the first three years of his career might be the reason you had never really heard Ryan’s name before.</p>\n<p>“I had really good players in front of me like Silva and Danny, so I had to let them do their thing,” Ryan said. “They had a lot of success. I knew I could have that role.”</p>\n<p>This year, the team needed somebody to step up and take the role of that dominant midfielder. It was a role Ryan wanted and took into his own hands.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a change in mentality,” Ryan said. “I wanted to be that player to get the goal or the assist. This year, I felt like I was the guy — that one midfielder — that had to score for us to win.”</p>\n<p>This year, Ryan took 26 shots, 11 more than he took in his first three years combined. His 19 points are also exceptionally greater than his contribution in the first three years when he tallied just five points, including two goals.</p>\n<p>“He played with a lot of confidence this year,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s the most dramatic change from last year. Once we started to lose our forwards, he took it upon himself to score. I think there was a lot of leadership too. Even though he doesn’t scream and yell, he demanded the ball and stepped up his play in the bigger games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also made a tactical change, moving Ryan into a central midfield position this year. The position was better suited for Ryan than his original outside mid position and gave him more scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Before I got to UCSB, I always played attacking mid, so I was comfortable with that role,” Ryan said. “Usually on the outside, you concentrate on getting the cross off and since I was in the middle [this year], I was in the box and receiving the ball at the end of the cross.”</p>\n<p>Now, Ryan’s season and career as a Gaucho are done. But like the great players who played at UCSB before him, there may be a spot for him at the pro level.</p>\n<p>For Ryan, going pro has been a lifelong dream. He’s strived for this goal all his life, as his dad was a professional soccer player (a midfielder) for the San Jose Earthquakes. At UCSB, Ryan wore No. 14, just like his dad.</p>\n<p>“[My dad’s] probably been the number one influence soccer-wise that I’ve had in my life,” Ryan said. “He brought me up with the game. He was always my coach until I went to UCSB. I [went] to his games and [grew] up with his soccer friends and [watched] soccer with him all the time. He took a lot of time out of his day to help me develop as a player, so I owe a lot to him.”</p>\n<p>The next step for Ryan will be receiving an invitation to the MLS combine, where coaches will take a look at the college seniors. To get drafted, participating in this combine is a must.</p>\n<p>“You would hope as the midfielder of the year he can get that invitation,” Vom Steeg said. “I definitely think he can play at the next level. He makes good decisions on the ball and he’s good around the net, so I think Nic can help a team at the next level; but it’s whether somebody can appreciate that, because he’s not a player that will make an incredible move and make people go ‘wow.’ Because of him, though, your team will play better.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 14th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/","id":1620,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1619,1618,1617],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Season Opener in Vegas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite a career-high 13 points from senior guard Destini Mason, the UCSB women’s basketball team was unable to come away with a win on the road in the team’s season opener, losing 58-52 to UNLV i...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite a career-high 13 points from senior guard Destini Mason, the UCSB women’s basketball team was unable to come away with a win on the road in the team’s season opener, losing 58-52 to UNLV in a game that came down to the final minute for the second straight year.</p>\n<p>The loss marks the fourth consecutive year that the Gauchos have lost their season opener.

Sophomore forward Alana Cesarz led the run for the Rebels, scoring six of UNLV’s 13 final points of the half.</p>\n<p>UCSB played catch-up the majority of the second half. However, with 6:40 remaining, Mason converted a crucial layup that not only gave her a new career high, but also gave the Gauchos a 44-42 lead, their first of the second half.</p>\n<p>“On offense, she can attack and create her own shot and create for others,” Mitchell said. “She has that ability to score in double figures every night.”</p>\n<p>The home team quickly responded as senior guard Kelli Thompson drained a three to regain the lead. UCSB junior guard Nicole Nesbit hit an elbow jumper to make the score 46-45 with under five minutes to go, but that would be the last lead the Gauchos would see. UNLV went on an 8-3 run, sparked by Thompson, enough to give the Rebels a small cushion.</p>\n<p>“We had some miscommunication and during the breakdown, [Thompson] was able to get rebound put backs,” Mitchell said. “Our defense has to be better and we know that.”</p>\n<p>Like last year’s game, it came down to the very end. Nesbit came up with a steal at half court and made the open layup with 24 seconds left, bringing the Gauchos within two at 52-54.</p>\n<p>UCSB then had to foul. Thompson made both free throws to expand the lead back to a two possession game. On UCSB’s next possession, junior guard Rmanii Haynes stole the ball from Nesbit and was able to ice the game for UNLV from the line.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos held Thompson to just five points in the first half, the Rebels’ leader came alive in the second, finishing the game with a double-double with 18 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating,” Mitchell said. “We knew the ball was going to go to her and through her.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding, which was a huge focus for UCSB this week, was another issue as the Gauchos were outrebounded 43-33.</p>\n<p>“The first half, we did a decent job,” Mitchell said. “In the second half, when he had breakdowns, we were scrambling and that leads to a lot of mistakes on the block out. You can’t win games being outrebounded by 10 on the road.”</p>\n<p>In addition to Mason’s 13 points, Nesbit tallied 12 points, five assists and three steals. Junior guard Melissa Zornig also added 11 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home next Wednesday for its home opener against New Mexico State.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 13th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-13/ucsb-drops-season-opener-vegas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-13/ucsb-drops-season-opener-vegas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-13/ucsb-drops-season-opener-vegas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-13/ucsb-drops-season-opener-vegas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-13/ucsb-drops-season-opener-vegas/","id":729,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[728,727,726],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":163,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
