The Huskies drew ten fouls on the Gauchos in the first half hitting 12-17 from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>NIU’s junior guard Aaric Armstead led the way with 12 points and went a perfect 4-4 behind the free throw line. Grabbing down ten rebounds and finishing with a double-double, the third year from Chicago, Illinois failed to register a bucket in the second half.</p>\n<p>Following two converted free throws from freshman forward Jarriese Blackmon to put UCSB on top 19-18, the Huskies compiled a 25-9 run reclaiming the lead and ended the first half with a halftime lead of 43-32.</p>\n<p>A turnover from guard Eric Childress opened up the second half and led to a go-ahead layup from Travon Baker. This gave Northern Illinois its largest lead at 13 points.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the sloppy start, the Gauchos regrouped and responded with a run of their own.</p>\n<p>Off the Baker layup, Eric Childress went coast-to-coast and finished with a finger roll which trimmed NIU’s lead back to 11.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to chip away at the Huskies’ lead as Vincent connected on a free-throw line extended jumper followed by a three-point make from senior Michael Bryson, his second of the night. UCSB regained some momentum and cut the deficit to single-digits, 39-45, with 17:15 left in the game.</p>\n<p>The Huskies continued to battle however in the 11<sup>th</sup> minute as 6’10 forward Marin Maric knocked down a pair of free throws and intercepted a pass from freshman Maxwell Kupchak.</p>\n<p>Maric then found his teammate Marshon Wilson for an easy transition layup maintaining a six-point lead at 52-46. Wilson was a spark for the Huskies’ second unit as the freshman shot 6-11 from the field and finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>With NIU up six points approaching nine minutes to play, the Gauchos assembled their most important run yet.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara pulled away in the final minutes, producing a 13-3 run to end the game.</p>\n<p>Senior Sam Beeler played an effective part in this, racking up 10 of his total 16 points with eight minutes to go including a 15-foot baseline jumper that extended his teams lead to 63-58 with 3:26 left.</p>\n<p>The senior concluded the game with an 8-9 shooting performance, helping UCSB seize its first postseason tournament victory since defeating the University of Houston in the first round of the 1990 NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face Old Dominion in the semifinal round of the Vegas 16 Classic.</p>\n<p>Coming off a 75-59 over Tennessee Tech, the Monarchs are on a streak of their own having won eight of their last nine matchups. Senior guards Aaron Bacote and Trey Freeman combined for a total of 34 points in ODU’s win Monday night.</p>\n<p>Tip off for tonight’s matchup will begin at 6 p.m. in the Mandalay Bay Center. The game will also be broadcasted live on CBS Sports Network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69170\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69170\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/","id":334,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[333,332,331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Back in Action, Take on NIU in Vegas 16","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite not earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament, the 2015-16 season continues for the UCSB men's basketball team as it will face NIU in the first round of the Vegas 16 Tournament this Monday.

Coming off a 79-62 loss to Ohio University, NIU heads into Mandalay Bay Center with a respective record of 21-12 overall and 9-9 in the MAC.</p>\n<p>Winners of nine-straight before its semifinal loss in Anaheim, UCSB has proven itself as a team capable of finishing strong. Moreover, Santa Barbara has found its spark offensively in the month of March, shooting 48.5 percent from the floor and outscoring opponents by 14.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the opening round of the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara shot 54 percent and went 11-23 from the three-point line in a 26-point victory (87-61) against UC Davis. This matched UCSB’s largest margin of victory against a conference opponent this year.</p>\n<p>While their offensive efficiency has been a concern for opposing teams, the Gauchos’ strong play can also be accredited to a pestering defense that is currently +7 in the turnover margin and averaging 15 or more points off turnovers over a four-game stretch.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Eric Childress has become a vital contributor to this tenacious defense recording a career-high six steals, four in the first twenty minutes of play, in Santa Barbara’s loss to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>With solid performances on both ends of the court, Santa Barbara’s second unit has relieved some pressure in tight situations and been an aid in closing out games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have increased their bench production to nearly half of the team’s total points, 30.3, during this month. While coming up short in their last game, the second unit of UCSB outscored the Warriors’ bench 26-14 commanded by forward Alex Hart. The second year player out of British Columbia, Canada had his best performance yet scoring 13 points in nine minutes of play, trimming a 21-point Hawaii advantage to eight in the second half.</p>\n<p>This mixture of hard-nosed defense, streaky shooting, and bench support will be key ingredients for Head Coach Bob Williams and his team heading into their match against NIU.</p>\n<p>As for fifth year Head Coach Mark Montgomery and his Northern Illinois Huskies, they will rely on a talented core of underclassmen to propel their way to victory. A starting lineup that features two freshmen and one sophomore, the Huskies are a scrappy yet disciplined team that can compete against experienced squads.</p>\n<p>NIU ranked second in the MAC conference this year allowing just 67.1 points per game. With 6’10 forward Marin Maric and All MAC-Defensive Player Aaric Armstead down low, this duo will try and stymie shooters like Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent from getting good looks and driving to the basket.</p>\n<p>While the Huskies finished ninth in the MAC in terms of shooting production, 72.7 points per game, look for an even distribution of scoring by Montgomery’s starters to carry the load offensively.</p>\n<p>Four out of five starters are currently averaging double-figures in scoring for Northern Illinois with Maric leading the pack at 12.1 ppg. The redshirt sophomore from Croatia has tallied home 14 double-doubles on the year, including two 22-point performances this season.</p>\n<p>In the backcourt, senior Travon Baker will be the primary player that the Gauchos’ defense will attempt to contain. NIU’s all-time leader in steals with 181 and second in school history with 355 assists, Baker is a savvy guard who can draw double teams and open up opportunities for his teammates.</p>\n<p>Guards like Vincent and Childress must do a good job keeping Baker in front and limiting his playmaking ability.</p>\n<p>Tip off between the Gauchos and Huskies will take place at 4:30 p.m. CT, 2:30 p.m. PT. The matchup will be broadcasted live on CBS Sports Network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69126\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69126\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/","id":333,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[332,331,330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prepare to End Non-Conference vs. LMU, Host Cal Poly Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Softball_vsSanDiego-DustinHarris-03312015-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Softball_vsSanDiego-DustinHarris-03312015-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a 3-2 finish as the host of the Gaucho Classic II, the UCSB softball team will resume play this Tuesday versus LMU to end out its non-conference schedule.

San Diego was the only team to improve its overall record which is now 14-21 after a 4-1 mark at the tournament.</p>\n<p>Friday was UCSB’s best day with back to back wins against both Santa Clara and Seattle. In an eight inning game against Santa Clara, the Gauchos found themselves down 4-0 after five innings of play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally woke up in the sixth inning scoring three runs to cut the deficit to one at 4-3. UCSB was able to hold Santa Clara scoreless for the next two innings, while scoring one run in each to earn the 5-4 win.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Lena Mayor and freshman Veronika Gulvin split the pitching duties against Santa Clara with four innings each and both earning four strikeouts in the process. Gulvin secured the win, now 5-8 on the season, after giving up only one run on two hits.</p>\n<p>After struggling through a 2-0 loss against Seattle the day before, the Gauchos got back on the winning track when it beat Seattle 6-3. UCSB out hit Seattle 13-6 with three Gauchos contributing two hits each.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Kristen Clark scored three runs on the day, while sophomore right fielder Jessica Johnston went 2-3 (.666) with both hits being extra-base hits and knocked in four runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game by scoring two runs right off the bat, however, Seattle responded in the second with two runs of its own to make it 2-2. Johnston responded to Seattle’s two-run comeback with a single to right field, knocking in Clark and junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos to make the score 4-2.</p>\n<p>Seattle would add one run in the third inning to make the score 4-3, but two more runs by Santa Barbara in the fourth inning put the game away as it secured its 6-3 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final game on Saturday against San Diego was a frustrating finish for the Gauchos considering they held a 2-0 lead until the sixth frame when San Diego scored two runs to tie the score at two. The game then went into extra innings where San Diego scored two runs in the eighth to win the game 4-2.</p>\n<p>Clark and freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer were the only two Gauchos to put numbers on the board. Senior infielder Arianna Palomares’ sacrifice fly resulted in an RBI that brought home Clark, while Altmeyer contributed with a homer to center field.</p>\n<p>Although the final loss was a tough one, the weekend was a solid one for UCSB to build of off. It showed some great signs of a team that is ready to do well in conference play which begins Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will stay at home to play a non-conference game on Tuesday, March 29 against Loyola Marymount at 2:00 pm at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They added one run to their lead in the top of the third inning to make the score 2-0.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the third frame the Trojans woke up as they rallied a four-run inning, due in large part to senior out fielder Timmy Robinson’s three-run homer, to take the lead at 4-2.</p>\n<p>They then added one run in the fifth as well as the sixth, thanks to another Robinson home run, to extend the lead to 6-2.</p>\n<p>In the sixth inning USC put away the Gauchos scoring three more runs courtesy of junior catcher Jeremy Martinez two-RBI double, and Robinson’s sac-fly RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB tried to respond scoring two runs in the seventh after redshirt junior out fielder Andrew Calica’s two-RBI triple but it would not be enough as it eventually fell to the Trojans 9-5. The loss snapped the previous nine-game winning streak Santa Barbara was on.</p>\n<p>Pitchers Joe Record, a sophomore redshirt, and Chris Clements, a sophomore, both struggled in the game. Record (3-2) picked up the loss after allowing five runs on seven hits in four innings while Clements allowed four runs on five hits in 1.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Before the tough loss that snapped their streak, the Gauchos extended it to nine after another home victory. Solid pitching was the key in this game as the team of Noah Davis and Kyle Nelson held the Trojans to two runs.</p>\n<p>USC began the scoring in this game after senior David Oppenheim hit an RBI double down the left field line to take the early 1-0 lead. Its lead was extended to 2-0 in the third after an error by the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB began its comeback in the bottom of the fourth frame when Adams hit a two-run double to tie the game at 2-2. It then took the lead in the fifth inning after an RBI single by sophomore DH Austin Bush which brought Calica home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added one run in both the sixth and eighth inning thanks to freshman Michael McAdoo’s RBI fielder’s choice and redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno’s RBI triple respectively.</p>\n<p>Davis (2-0), a freshman, pitched a solid game allowing one earned run on four hits and struck out four batters on six innings pitched earning him the victory.</p>\n<p>Nelson also continued his excellent season picking up his second save after pitching three innings and allowing three hits and no runs. The sophomore has only allowed one run the entire season.</p>\n<p>To begin the three-game series, Santa Barbara came into the match-up looking to avenge the loss that knocked them out of the regionals last year. Coming in hot, off two previous weekend sweeps, it was ready to get some sort of revenge.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out swinging and put away USC early. It out hit USC 12-6 and scored 10 runs while holding USC to one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began the scoring putting three runs on the board in the bottom of the second inning courtesy of one Trojan error and a two-run homer by Adams, his fourth of the year.</p>\n<p>They added two more runs in the fourth inning courtesy of Calica’s RBI single and a balk committed by the pitcher led to senior Ryan Clark scoring making the score 5-0.</p>\n<p>USC added one run in the fifth inning but it was not enough as UCSB proceeded to score five runs over the next two innings to secure the 10-1 victory. It was the sixth time it scored 10 or more runs in a game.</p>\n<p>Clark had a solid game going 3-4 (.750) with one RBI and two runs scored. Another notable hitter was junior utility Billy Fredrick who went 2-4 (.500) with one run scored and one RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Shane Bieber (4-1) picked up his fourth win of the season after going seven innings and allowing only one run on five hits while registering two strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The big lead allowed coach Checketts to throw in freshman pitcher Kevin Chandler to get some solid playing time. The right-hander pitched two full innings, almost as much as he pitched in his previous four games combined, and allowed one hit, no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>The weekend was another solid one for the UCSB baseball team. It won another series and although it’s winning streak was stopped, there is no doubt that the team is having a great season thus far.</p>\n<p>However, it will be important to see how Santa Barbara bounces back after a loss. Also the team will be away from home for the next seven games so it will be interesting to see how that could possibly affect the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday, March 29 against Pepperdine at 3 p.m at Eddy D.

At the end of the four-hour contest, Boise State found themselves on top 4-3 with a walk-off victory on court four.</p>\n<p>The match started in Santa Barbara’s favor as it took the doubles point with wins from some of the team’s veteran players on courts one and three. Junior co-captain Morgan Mays and senior Andrew Riminton were the first off with a dominant 6-2 win on court three.</p>\n<p>The nation’s No. 34 doubles team of seniors Nathan Eshmade and Miles Seemann would seal the doubles point and a 1-0 lead for the Gauchos with a close victory of 7-5 on court one.</p>\n<p>Heading into singles play the Gauchos would continue their success as they built upon their lead with two wins on the lower courts. Sophomore Cody Rakela and freshman Oliver Sec both captured straight set sweeps over their opponents on courts five and six, respectively, to start the singles round.</p>\n<p>These two wins put the Gauchos up 3-0 over the Broncos and Santa Barbara would need just one more match to clinch the overall win.</p>\n<p>With their backs against the wall, the Broncos would grind out three straight singles wins on the upper courts to tie the match at 3-3.</p>\n<p>All three wins for Boise State were decided in tiebreakers and extra sets as the team outlasted the Gauchos. With the score tied, the decider would fall on court four where freshman Anders Holm of Santa Barbara faced Boise’s freshman Kyle Butters.</p>\n<p>This final freshman bout would go to three sets, all of which were played in full to the tiebreaker in the end. Holm won the first set with a 7-3 victory in the break, but Butters captured the second in the break 7-5.</p>\n<p>Carrying his momentum from the second, the first year Bronco sealed the match and the upset for his team defeating Holm 6-7(3-7), 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-3) overall. His win notched the final score at 4-3 in favor of Boise State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would look to its next match on the road Friday afternoon at Loyola Marymount and in the end found the same results as the team’s previous heartbreak with Boise State. In Los Angeles, the Gauchos looked to bounce back but again were downed by one point as the Lions won 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would again start out the match with a 1-0 lead as it took the doubles point with wins on courts one and three. This was the sixth straight time that the Gauchos captured the doubles round in dual match play.</p>\n<p>The No. 34 team of Eshmade and Seemann defeated its opponents 6-2 on court one and the duo of Mays and Riminton would seal the point with a 6-4 win on three. It has now been 10 matches since Eshmade’s and Seemann’s last doubles loss and they have registered eight wins over that time.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its success early in the singles round winning two of the first three completed matches.</p>\n<p>Rakela added another win on court five, giving him his fifth straight, as he took a one-sided victory of 6-1, 6-2 only dropping three total games in his sweep. After dropping a match on court six, Eshmade added a singles win for his team in sweeping fashion on court one.</p>\n<p>The senior player took a 7-6(7-3), 6-2 win that put the Gauchos up 3-1. Santa Barbara would once again look for just one more singles win to clinch.</p>\n<p>Trailing by two in front of their home crowd, the Lions would rally winning the next three singles matches to give them the overall win over the Gauchos 4-3.</p>\n<p>The final two matches on courts two and three came down to three sets and LMU was able to outlast Santa Barbara, as the nation’s No. 51 team took its second straight loss by one point in walk-off fashion. UCSB would return home to face No. 47 Denver on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The match with the Pioneers was all too similar for the Gauchos, but this time it would be Santa Barbara that came out on top 4-3. This win snapped the team’s two-match skid and could not have been timelier versus a ranked opponent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got out to a slow start on Easter as they dropped the doubles point falling on courts one and three. The freshman squad of Holm and Nicolas Moreno de Alboran would capture the team’s only doubles win with a 6-4 outing on court two.</p>\n<p>Down 1-0, Santa Barbara would need four singles wins to avoid dropping its third straight dual match.</p>\n<p>The Pioneers claimed the first singles match to build upon their lead, but the Gauchos would answer back winning three straight matches on the lower courts to take the late lead, 3-2.</p>\n<p>Rakela and Sec added straight set wins of 7-5, 7-5 and 7-5, 6-3, respectively on the bottom two courts and Holm would give his team the lead with a 6-2, 1-6, 6-2 win on court four.</p>\n<p>For the third straight time, the Gauchos would look for just one more win in singles play. They turned to courts two and three, where Moreno de Alboran and Mays both played into a third set.</p>\n<p>After dropping the second set on court three, Mays was cold in the start of the third falling behind his opponent 4-1.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, the team’s co-captain would rise winning five straight games to seal both his match and a 4-2 overall win for Santa Barbara, ending its short losing streak. The Pioneers would end the match taking a court two win to set the final score at 4-3 in UCSB’s favor.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will remain at home and will open up Big West Conference play with two matches on the weekend. They will face Hawaii on Friday at 10 a.m. and UC Irvine on Sunday at 2 p.m. Both matches will be held at the Rec Cen Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69151\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69151\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/","id":101,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[100,99,98],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces Off Against a Familiar Foe","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team will look to keep its winning streak going as well as get some payback against USC, the team that knocked them out of the regionals last year, this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB baseball team will look to keep extending its winning streak as it faces USC in a three-game series this weekend.

Last season, Santa Barbara beat USC twice in the regular season but ultimately, the Trojans were the team that knocked the Gauchos out of the Lake Elsinore Regionals.</p>\n<p>Remembering this, UCSB will be motivated to play USC regardless of its slow start to the season. And again it would be smart not to underestimate this team as it does have solid pieces.</p>\n<p>As a team the Trojans are batting a solid .303 from the plate, good enough for fourth in their respective conference. They are also tied for first in home runs as they have hit 15 out of the park this year.</p>\n<p>The offense is carried by many players on this team such as is senior infielder AJ Ramirez who leads the team in RBI (20). Another senior helping lead the charge is outfielder David Oppenheim who leads the team in batting average (.413).</p>\n<p>Pitching wise, the Trojans have struggled boasting a team ERA of 4.26 which ranks seventh in their conference. Pitching for USC Thursday will be right-hander Kyle Davis.</p>\n<p>The senior has struggled a bit this season allowing 36 hits and 17 runs in 35 innings pitched. Davis comes into the Thursday match-up with an overall record of 2-3 on the season as well as a less than stellar 4.37 ERA.</p>\n<p>In order to defeat the opponents that knocked them off last year, the Gauchos will need to continue its hot hitting from Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The best thing about UCSB this season is that everyone on its team can go off at any moment and have a spectacular hitting day. This was the case on Tuesday’s game as redshirt junior Devon Gradford had a great game batting 3-4 (.750) and four RBI.</p>\n<p>Fellow teammate, redshirt sophomore Josh Adams also had a big day batting a perfect 3-3 (.1000) and one RBI while also scoring four runs. Junior shortstop Clay Fisher also helped going 2-4 (.500) with one RBI and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Pitching for the Gauchos on Tuesday will most likely be right-hander Shane Bieber. The junior has pitched 33 innings this season, most on the team, posting a solid 3.55 ERA and striking out 27 batters leading to his solid 3-1 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber is hot coming into this game as in the last two games he has allowed only one run in 13 innings while also striking out 13 batters.</p>\n<p>This series will be important for the Gauchos. Not only will it be a chance to get some payback for last season, but it would also keep the momentum high.</p>\n<p>UCSB is off to one of the best starts in school history and has shocked many people with its great play. It must stay on track and continue to garner the national attention it deserves so far this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next series is against USC which begins Thursday, March 24 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m. Friday’s game will be at the same time and place as Thursday, however, Saturday’s match will be at USC’s home turf, Dedeaux Field, at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The two have deflected title talk and motivated their less-expensive squads better than any of the coaches at the so-called “big clubs,” including Jose Mourinho, who was fired midseason, and Louis Van Gaal and Arsene Wenger, who are also fighting to keep their jobs before the season comes to a close.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The biggest difference between the two teams at the top and those chasing them isn’t how deep their pockets are, but how incredibly strategic both Leicester and Tottenham have been with spending their money.</p>\n<p>With Pochettino at the helm, the Spurs boasts a roster peppered with homegrown talent such as Ryan Mason and the league’s current goals leader (21) in Harry Kane. While the club has benefited from its choice in local talent, the manager’s best bit of business has resulted through the transfer market, specifically the addition of young attacking midfielder Deli Alli for just over 6 million pounds last winter.</p>\n<p>Via ESPNFC, The English international has scored seven goals and tallied nine assists in his first year as a starter, and has looked like one of the best bargains in recent history this season. With a core of Kane, Alli and Christian Eriksen, the north London team looks like one that could surpass bitter rival Arsenal while becoming a perennial contender.</p>\n<p>While Tottenham ignited its rise in talent through the promotion of youthful players and diligent work in the transfer market, their calculated approach is incomparable to the wonder-deals pulled off to build the Leicester squad that finds itself only seven games away from the club’s first ever title.</p>\n<p>The Foxes’ starting lineup cost a mere 32.5 million euros, 20 million of which was spent on breakout starts N’Golo Kante and Shinji Okazaki alone.</p>\n<p>To put that in perspective, Manchester City paid 75 million for Kevin DeBruyne and 62 million for Raheem Sterling in the offseason. Although they have performed well since moving to Manchester, the Citizens, who were widely considered the favorites to win the Prem, sit in fourth place by a margin of fifteen points behind the leaders.</p>\n<p>Yet, Leicester’s most noteworthy pick up was the signing of Riyad Mahrez from AC Le Havre, a second division French team, for a mere 500 thousand euros. Mahrez has absolutely lit up the league, leading his side’s attack week after week, finding the net 16 times and setting up his teammates another 19, ranking best in the EPL.</p>\n<p>The Algeria international is the frontrunner for the Player of the Year award in his debut season and will surely attract monumental offers from football giants across Europe, and even if he does move on at the end of the season, Leicester’s maestro has been one of the greatest signings in Premier League history.</p>\n<p>Still, the most prevalent issue that remains for both the Spurs and Foxes will be finding a way to contain their key players by helping them to fend off the temptations of the riches that will be offered by teams such as United, Chelsea, City and whoever else.</p>\n<p>But, the championship potential of this season must remain at the forefront for both clubs as they have refreshed the EPL with a process of team building that does not revolve around the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the richer clubs will take note that it’s not always about buying the most expensive players, but rather the players that fit together and work as a unit to get results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>All statistics credit to transfermarkt.com and ESPNFC.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/","id":1972,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1971,1970,1969],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hoping to Get Back on Track, Host Gauchos Classic II","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-4-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-4-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a frustrating 1-4 finish in last weekend's SDSU/San Diego Classic II, the UCSB softball team is hoping to regain its momentum in its return home as the host of the Gaucho Classic II.

As a team, Bakersfield is hitting only .237, but has one player, sophomore outfielder Julea Cavazos, who is hitting .364.</p>\n<p>Also contributing is junior infielder Selena Gonzalez, who is hitting an outstanding .429 at the plate. The Roadrunners have only scored a total of 59 runs, while giving up a total of 103.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield’s pitching has struggled this year as well, however senior starter Amber Mills carries a 2.92 ERA. She has given up a total of 20 earned runs in 48 innings this season, but has managed to tally only  23 strikeouts .</p>\n<p>The weekend shouldn’t get much harder for the Gauchos when they take on the Seattle Redhawks in <span data-term=\"goog_23356199\">Friday’s</span> late game. Seattle enters the tournament with a 10-16 record and a team batting average of .261. It’s best hitter, junior second baseman Paige Bouska, leads her team with a batting average of .366, and will pose a threat to the Gaucho pitching staff.</p>\n<p>Redhawks starting pitcher freshman Andie Larkins should have a difficult time with the hard hitting Gaucho lineup. Larkins is 8-6 on the year with 52 strikeouts in 86.2 innings.She has a respectable ERA of 2.91, giving up 36 earned runs this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its weekend with a bout versus Santa Clara <span data-term=\"goog_23356200\">on Friday</span>. The Broncos have one of the worst records of the four opponents the Gauchos will face this weekend. Santa Clara, with an overall record of 5-24, holds the lowest batting average of the four with an average of .233.</p>\n<p>The Broncos are another team who is weak in both hitting and pitching this year. The pitching staff allowed opponents to hit for a lofty .352 average on the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara’s best pitcher, sophomore starter Micaela Vierra, carries a shaky 4.83 ERA in addition to giving up 58  earned runs in 84 innings pitched this season.  She comes into the game with a 3-10 record and 41 strikeouts.  Senior infielder Casandra Padilla leads the team in hitting with a .298 average.  She also leads the team with two home runs, 12 runs scored, and 15 RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will finish the weekend with perhaps its most competitive game against the University of San Diego. San Diego has an overall record of 10-20, and brings a team batting average of .288. However, San Diego’s best pitcher Megan Sabbatini, with a 3.70 ERA, has the most strikeouts of any pitcher the Gauchos will face, striking out 92 hitters in 87 innings pitched. The hard throwing Sabbatini will surely put the pressure on a strong UCSB lineup.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the Gauchos enter this weekend’s  tournament as the team to beat. After its tough  losses in San Diego, it will be looking to boost its confidence with wins over the weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/","id":1140,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1139,1138,1137],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Continue Firing on All Cylinders","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB looks to win its seventh consecutive game against CSU Bakersfield today away from home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off another weekend sweep of its opponent, the UCSB baseball team has caught fire winning its last six contests and will look to extend that streak to seven after today’s game against CSU Bakersfield.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68682\" style=\"width: 340px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68682\" data-attachment-id=\"68682\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-01/ucsb-looks-to-continue-winning-ways-against-no-21-ucla/justin-kelly-sends-a-curveball-to-the-batter-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Justin Kelly sends a curveball to the batter.

The all-time series record between these two teams is also split at 7-7.</p>\n<p>While this game may look like an easy one on paper, it is important that UCSB does not overlook its opponents. Although it has struggled, CSUB still has the necessary pieces to make games interesting.</p>\n<p>Leading the offensive charge is redshirt junior outfielder Dustin Frailey who leads the team in batting average (.454), in on-base percentage (.545), and slugging percentage (.667). He is also one of two players to hit a home run this season.</p>\n<p>Helping Frailey lead the charge is David Metzgar. The junior currently leads the team in RBI with 17 while also batting a solid .329, good for third on the team.</p>\n<p>Pitching wise, the Gauchos will most likely face junior Max Carter. The right hander has struggled this season having an 0-2 record while posting an 11.05 ERA. Carter has allowed nine runs in 7.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Carter, if he wants to turn around his season he will have to do it against one of the hottest teams in college baseball right now.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are led by first baseman Austin Bush who is second on the team in batting average (.370), first in hits (20), and first in RBI (19).</p>\n<p>The sophomore has had a great season thus far winning Tournament MVP honors in San Diego, named Big West POTW, and most recently hit a walk-off home run to give his team a victory. While Bush’s performance has been great he has also received tremendous help from a slew of players.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomores JJ Muno and Josh Adams lead the team in home runs (3), while redshirt junior Andrew Calica leads the team in on-base percentage (.517). Catcher Grover Dempsey, another redshirt sophomore, leads the team in batting average (.422) and slugging percentage (.600).</p>\n<p>Pitching for the Gauchos on Tuesday will most likely be right-hander Shane Bieber. The junior has pitched 33 innings this season, most on the team, posting a solid 3.55 ERA and striking out 27 batters leading to his solid 3-1 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber is hot coming into this game as in the last two games he has allowed only one run in 13 innings while also striking out 13 batters.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara is the clear favorite to win this game, however, it would be smart to not fall into a trap game.

The Gauchos quickly responded in the bottom of the inning after redshirt sophomore Josh Adams hit a two-run homer to take a 2-1 lead after two innings.</p>\n<p>UCSB added another run in the third thanks to redshirt sophomore JJ Muno’s third home run of the season and would also add one in the fourth to take a 4-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning Santa Barbara again was able to shut down the Huskies offense while adding more runs to its lead. Both runs scored in the inning were due to errors made by the visiting team which gave the Gauchos a 6-1 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>The Huskies would add one more run in the seventh inning, however, they could not muster enough hits to make a comeback which lead to their eventual 6-2 loss.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitcher Joe Record picked up his third win of the season after a solid seven-inning performance. The redshirt sophomore allowed six hits and two runs while also striking out five batters.</p>\n<p>Before having the opportunity to clinch a series sweep, UCSB first had to make a comeback if it wanted to seal a victory over UConn.</p>\n<p>Senior first baseman and captain Bobby Melley, who had a great game going 3-5 with three RBI and one homer, started the scoring for the Huskies after an RBI-single. However, they could not hold on to their lead because of errors. The Gauchos would capitalize scoring one in the third and one in the fourth to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>After adding one run in the sixth to tie the game at two, UConn exploded for three runs in the top of the seventh to take a 5-2 lead. Sophomore third baseman Willy Yahn ignited the scoring after a sac fly RBI and Melly hit a two run homer to help extend the lead even further.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded by scoring three runs on their own in the bottom of the seventh to tie the game up, courtesy of redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s RBI single, redshirt sophomore catcher Grover Dempsey’s RBI single and freshman outfielder Michael McAdoo’s RBI-double.</p>\n<p>Uconn would regain the lead one more time thanks to Buckley’s RBI single in the top of the eighth, however, UCSB was to much as it added four more runs in the bottom of the inning and won the game 9-6.</p>\n<p>McAdoo had a great game going 3-5 with three RBI and two runs scored. He has been showing flashes as of late and has been a breakout player garnering solid playing time as a freshman. Fisher also had a solid game going 2-3 on the evening with three runs scored.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s win, Friday’s match-up between Uconn and UCSB was the first time these two teams met in school history and it did not disappoint as the game went down to the wire with a walk-off three-run homer by sophomore DH Austin Bush that sealed the deal for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The scoring began early for Santa Barbara as it drew first blood in the first inning after a McAdoo sac fly RBI that brought in Calica. UConn tied the game in the third inning at one after senior Jack Sundberg batted in a runner with a groundout down the right field line.</p>\n<p>Bush helped his team regain the lead in the bottom of the seventh after a solid RBI-single. However, in the top of the eighth an error by the Gauchos gave UConn a run and tied the game at two.</p>\n<p>The ninth inning the real drama unfolded as junior DH Tyler Gnesda hit his third home run of the season to give his team a 3-2 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth. Down to three outs, the Gauchos showed they were not fazed by the pressure and that they were resiliant.</p>\n<p>Calica started the inning strong with a double down the left field line followed by Dempsey reaching first base on a fielder’s choice and sending Calica to third. With no outs UCSB already had the tying run in scoring position and a go-ahead runner on base.</p>\n<p>After an Adams strikeout, the Gauchos knew they still had two outs to get the tying run home or even win the game right there. The next batter was Bush, who has already had a fantastic season thus far. The sophomore added a game-winning walk-off home run to his fantastic season as his three-run shot ended the game 5-3 in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another great weekend for Santa Barbara has to have them feeling well about its start to the season. Not only has it had great offensive fireworks, but it seems as though the pitching staff is starting to improve as well.</p>\n<p>Many new faces have stepped up and has really impressed not only the coaching staff but the fans as well. Not many people predicted a 15-3 start for this young team, but that is why you play the games.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is going to be away from home Tuesday, March 22 against Cal State Bakersfield at Hardt Field  at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

This week was especially tough for Santa Barbara especially because they had to prepare not only for the Crimson, but also against the dreaded end of quarter exams that could have contributed to the team’s performance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p1\">“I have to give credit to Harvard they fought at each possession and they are a tough team they beat fresno state, and we didn’t underestimate them,” Said Head Coach Simon Thibodeau. “Practice was altered due to final exams it was tough to switch gears from finals and back at it. But no excuse. Need more consistency and hang out the court a little longer to make sure we do everything we can.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Crimson undoubtedly have just as a demanding academic responsibility but on the other hand Harvard<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>have now won five straight and have been on the winning end of eight of its last ten matches making up for the slow start to the campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They are 3-2 on the road and will be at home to commence Harvard’s<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Ivy League Conference contests against Cornell and Columbia.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB started Saturday’s matchup strong as it swept in the doubles portion to seal the point. The first to finish was the Gaucho duo consisting of sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson as they defeated senior Amy He and sophomore Nikki Kallenberg 6-3.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Adler and Atanasson are 10-6 overall, 6-3 in dual matches, and proving to be an efficient pair but have played mostly at the three spot winning all six matches while losing three times at the two spot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The next match ended in the same score as the first as junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada beat freshman Erica Oosterhout and junior June Lee who are 4-8 as a pair. Baker and Yamada on the other hand are 3-2 winning two straight and demonstrating consistency at the second slot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The last doubles match to finish was between the 18th best pair in the country against sophomore Annika RIngblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong that were 5-1 together prior to the start of the matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic handed them their second dual loss of the season by beating the Crimson pair 6-4. Stojic and Dubavets are 17-3 overall and 7-1 in dual play, all at the the one for UCSB.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After securing the first point, Santa Barbara managed to increase its lead by two when sophomore Dubavets beat sophomore Kallenberg in the singles portion of the contest in two sets winning both 6-2. However, UCSB would go on to lose the next four in singles to lose the match.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other half of the powerful Gaucho duo faced off against the sophomore she had just gotten off the court against in doubles. Ringblom and Stojic went all three sets. The first set finished in favor for SB finishing 4-6.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, after winning the first Stojic lost the next two by the scores of 6-4 and 6-3 in a close contest. This match was Stojic’s first coming off an injury where she took three weeks off.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It bugs her a little bit more during practice, but she (Stojic) was up 6-4 and it might have been rust seeing as she hasn’t played in three weeks.” Said Coach Thibodeau. “This is not just on stefani but all the matches that could have gone the other way. I believe she will step it up in the future and she is motivated to do so, and I look forward to seeing her do it”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another key matchup was between a highly anticipated encounter between senior Amy He and sophomore Natalie Da Silveira. Both came in with positive singles records and multiple consecutive wins. He and Da Silveira have played consistently at the six and that is where they met on Saturday.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a tough and back and forth game He was able to steal the first set winning 7-6. The second set on the other hand, it seems as if He was able to figure out the young Brazilian and continued to get the ball past her six more times as she won 6-1 to give the Crimson its first point of the dual.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After which Harvard went on to carry the momentum from that big win to win the next three as the tide began to turn against the Gauchos after these crucial points went the other way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We are usually strong at the bottom positions. The second set with Natalie i thought she would come back but then was down 4-0.” Said the Santa Barbara Head Coach. “But we have to move forward we have to finish our matches.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Lou Adler defeated junior June Lee in three sets, 6-7,6-3, and 6-1 to grant UCSB its third and final dual point. The match finished 4-3 in favor for the Crimson.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB will have to shake off another close loss and prepare for a quick turnaround as it takes on No. 24 Fresno State on Monday, March 21 at 11 a.m at the Rec Center Courts.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/","id":99,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[98,97,96],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Looking to Surpass Even Mark, Face Fresno Today and Boise St. Thursday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-21-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-21-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Approaching the halfway mark of its seven-match home stretch, the UCSB women's tennis team will attempt to improve its 5-4 home record with matches versus Fresno State today and Boise State on Thursda...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After another disappointing loss against a competitive Harvard side, the UCSB women’s tennis team will have a two-day turnaround to get ready for No. 24 Fresno State today morning and another early duel on Thursday versus Boise State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara owns a 6-6 record with five of its losses coming against ranked opponents and ending by a score of 4-3.

The Bulldogs are 10-5 overall despite having their five-game winning streak snapped against Harvard on Sunday in a 4-2 loss.</p>\n<p>Still, Fresno has managed to win eight out of its last ten matches. Also, against nationally ranked opponents the Bulldogs are 4-4, having recorded victories over No. 28 UCLA, No. 31 Arkansas, No. 58 Washington State, and then No. 56 Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Fresno is a place that current UCSB Head Coach Simon Thibodeau used to call home for nine years when he was the Head Coach for the Bulldogs’ women’s tennis team.</p>\n<p>During his time at Fresno he helped accumulate 159 wins and produced a plethora of nationally recognized players including ITA national doubles team of the year in Renata Kucerkova &amp; Anastasia Petukhova. However, this game is just like any other, as the red and black attire he once donned are merely fond memories.</p>\n<p>“All new girls, the assistant, the coach, all new people, but when you see the uniform, the logo, the colors, and ‘go dogs go’ it brings back good memories,’ but it’s just another team,” Thibodeau said. “They are doing a good job, they have a strong number one; it will be a good match. It would be nice to win against a former team but it’s not a rivalry or anything.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps it may not be a rivalry in the traditional sense, but there is nothing like getting a win against a former team. The Gauchos have yet to get a win against the Bulldogs during Coach Thibodeau’s tenure, losing the last two times these two teams met. In last season’s meeting between the programs, the Bulldogs were defeated.</p>\n<p>“We are a different team from last year; we have two players that played at the one and two last year and they are at the five and six this year.” Thibodeau said. “It will be nice to win, at one point. We have been close against everyone, just a matter of getting that extra point. We gotta make sure to finish these close matches.”</p>\n<p>The Fresno State-UCSB dual promises to be a good one with plenty of talent. Most notably, the matchup between the nationally ranked duos of UCSB’s No. 19 sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic vs. Fresno’s No. 20 sophomore Mayar Sherif Ahmed and her sister senior Rana Sherif Ahmed will be most intriguing.</p>\n<p>The Ahmed sisters enter with a 14-6 overall record in doubles, winning seven out of their last ten and are 3-3 against nationally ranked pairs. In the singles department, Mayar is No. 34 at 15-9, 5-6 against top ranked opponents. She has earned two consecutive conference player of the week awards along the way. Rana, the senior bulldog, is 10-10 overall with a 4-5 dual record, all at the four slot.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s match against the Bulldogs will take place today at 11 a.m. at the Rec Cen Courts. Its contest versus Boise State is set for this Thursday, March 24 at 10 a.m. PST at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/","id":100,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[99,98,97],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Slow Start Ends With UCSB’s Lone Victory at San Diego Classic II","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Softball_vsPittsburgh-20150214-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Softball_vsPittsburgh-20150214-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was a rough start for the UCSB softball team as it finished the weekend 1-3 in four games played at the San Diego Classic II.

The Gauchos managed to put the tying run on second with 2 outs in the inning, but Reinke struck out Jennifer Johnston to end the game. The loss extended the Gaucho losing streak to three games.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ Friday night game against San Jose State, their losing streak was extended to four games as the Spartans crushed Santa Barbara 12-3.</p>\n<p>The nine run margin is the largest deficit UCSB has endured since playing Texas A&amp;M earlier in the season. San Jose starter Chantrelle Ladner pitched a complete game, giving up three runs on seven hits in seven innings, while striking out six to pick up her fourth win of the year.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, second baseman Arianna Palomares and DP Jacqueline Hinojosa each collected two hits apiece in the game. The Gauchos scored all three of their runs in the second inning. The three runs were tallied by Palomares, senior Samantha Stark, and freshman Melanie Menor.</p>\n<p>San Jose’s powerful lineup took its toll on the Gauchos’ pitching staff, as it recorded 12 hits on the day, with home runs by outstanding sophomore outfielder Brittany Abacherli and infielder Arissa Pinedo.  Abacherli went 2-4 with three RBI’s, while Pinedo knocked in four RBI’s with two runs scored.  Gaucho starter Ashley Ludlow lasted only one inning, giving up four earned runs while striking out two.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ weekend only got worse when it took on the BYU Cougars on Saturday morning, losing 8-0 in just five innings. BYU starting pitcher McKenna Bull deserved all the attention in this one as she threw a masterful five inning no-hitter.  This was Bull’s second no-hitter of the year as she gave up just one walk.</p>\n<p>She struck out seven Gauchos in the game, striking out the side in the fifth to close it out. Cougar DP Madison Merrell went 2-3 in the game with a home run and four RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The UCSB pitching staff seemed to run out of steam when it allowed five runs in the fifth inning, all off Gulvin who had replaced Ludlow in relief.  Ludlow had a tough day giving up five earned runs in four innings.</p>\n<p>The only Gaucho baserunner in the game came on a walk to Altmeyer leading off the second inning.  However, she was left stranded at first base as the Gauchos simply couldn’t find contact at the plate against Bull’s pitching.</p>\n<p>Riding a five game losing streak, UCSB managed to turn things around in its Saturday afternoon game against Colorado State. After facing them the day before, the Gauchos knew what it would take to get a win, and that’s to score early as they won the game 11-7 in a slugfest.  Santa Barbara scored six runs in the third to break open its lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were paced by center fielder Stacy Cavazos who hit a home run and finished with four RBI’s. Second basemen Arianna Palomares also hit a home run and drove in two runs. Right fielder Jessica Johnston went 4-5 at the plate with two runs scored.</p>\n<p>In addition, Altmeyer and third basemen Emily Brucelas each had 2 RBI’s a piece.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sophomore starting pitcher Lena Mayer picked up her fifth win on the year, scattering seven hits and four runs while striking out two.</p>\n<p>Rams’ starter Bridgette Hutton took her fifth loss of the season after giving up six runs on five hits in just two innings while striking out one batter.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s game, the Gauchos took on San Diego State again and lost in heartbreaking fashion 6-5 on a walk-off solo homer by Aztec third baseman Molly Sturdivant leading off the bottom of the seventh. It was Sturdivant’s only hit in the game.</p>\n<p>The game started out well for the Gauchos as they scored three runs in the first inning capped by a two-run homer from second baseman Emily Brucelas.</p>\n<p>Kristen Clark led off the inning with a single, and she was sacrificed to second by Palomares. While facing two outs, Altmeyer doubled home Palomares, followed by the Brucelas home run to make it a 3-0 Gauchos’ lead. Santa Barbara added an unearned run in the second to make it 4-0 and registered its fifth run in the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs battled back however, with two runs in the second and a run in the fifth before tying it at five all with two more runs in the sixth on three hits when San Diego brought 9 batters to the plate.</p>\n<p>In the top of the seventh, the Gauchos rallied, putting two runners on base.  They got as far as third base with two outs before UCSB’s opportunity to possibly score ended on a flyout to centerfield off the bat of Stacy Cavazos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were led by Brucelas and shortstop Melanie Menor in the losing effort.</p>\n<p>Brucelas went 2-4 in the game with the home run and two RBI’s, while Menor went 3-3 at the plate with a run scored.  Also contributing for UCSB was Clark who had two hits, two runs scored and an RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had 13 hits in the game. Starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched well for the Gauchos giving up just three earned runs in 5.2 innings while scattering eight hits and striking out two.  Veronika Gulvin came on in relief in the 7<sup>th</sup> and took the loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rebound next weekend when it returns home to host the Gaucho Classic II, and will take on Bakersfield, Seattle, Santa Clara and San Diego once again.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69056\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69056\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/","id":1139,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1138,1137,1136],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Continue Winning Ways Against Harvard","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has won five straight home matches and looks to extend that streak against Harvard on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team prepares for a tough Harvard team in a match that promises to be an even contest because of the level of competition that both sides have faced up to this point in the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68511\" style=\"width: 237px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68511\" data-attachment-id=\"68511\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/palina-dubavets-hits-a-backhand-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Palina Dubavets hits a backhand.

It’s most recents wins have come against Providence and Rhode Island finishing 7-0. However, that does not seem to be an issue for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I know they lost to Portland earlier, I know they are similar to portland. I just want to play our best and approach the same.” Said Head Coach Simon Thibodeau.  “We look forward to the upcoming match.”</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB is mixing it up with ten different pairings at doubles, certain players have been consistent throughout, including No. 19 in doubles junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets that are 13-3 together and have won nine out of their last ten. Along with them, recent standout sophomore Natalie Da Silveira.</p>\n<p>The sophomore from Brazil has won four straight and in singles is 7-2 but with a nearly flawless dual record of 6-1. As a sophomore she has proven to be dependable at the five and six slots.</p>\n<p>“Not a big surprise to see her do well at the six she could even be our five or four.” Said the Coach. “One thing i’m most happy with is that she is just getting better and better even after she came back from being inactive for about 6 months. She is solid, feisty attitude that wants to roll the opponent off the court pretty quickly.”</p>\n<p>On the opposite side, Harvard has not been able to find consistency in doubles as it has tried over 15 combinations and pairings but has yet to find a stable group.
