Some teams have surprised us, like the Portland Trailblazers; other teams that looked promising have turned out to be massive failures, such as the two teams in New York. One of the biggest stories this season is the domination of the Western Conference over the East. Only four teams in the East are over .500 compared to eight in the West. With the exception of Indiana and Miami, there has been no competition when teams from the two sides have gone head-to-head. So, it’s time to take a look at the teams in the West. While the West has dominated over the East, there are some teams have overall have done really well and some that haven’t. At the halfway point, here’s a grade breakdown for each team in the more successful West.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oklahoma City Thunder, A-</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>OKC is once again looking like a team that could contend for an NBA championship. Kevin Durant is making a strong case for MVP once again, leading the NBA in points with 29.2 points per game. He is also shooting 49.7 percent from the field and 42.2 percent from three point range. His partner in crime on offense, Russell Westbrook, was having one of his best NBA seasons until he suffered another injury, but he will be back this season. Westbrook was giving the Thunder a phenomenal 21.3 points and 7.0 assists per game. If he can return to full health, OKC will be playing late into the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Antonio Spurs, A</p>\n<p>The team that was seconds away from another NBA championship last season is at it again. The Big Three in San Antonio in Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili continue to get older and yet still continue to be great. They lead the Spurs offensively, averaging 14.2, 17.7 and 12.6 points, respectively. The success for the Spurs, however, still comes on the defensive end. San Antonio doesn’t allow opponents to find an offensive groove and continues to rank among the best in scoring defense. Most didn’t think San Antonio would compete with Miami last season, but this team of veterans doesn’t like to lose. They will always be around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Portland Trailblazers, A+</p>\n<p>One of the biggest surprises in the NBA this season has been Portland. A team that was at one point topping the West, the Blazers are the top scoring team in the NBA, averaging 108.7 points per game. The scoring starts with LaMarcus Aldridge, who is averaging an incredible 23.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. Complementing Aldridge’s inside game is point guard Damian Lillard, who adds 21.3 points and 5.8 assists per game. Combined with Wesley Matthews on the perimeter, all-around player Nicolas Batum, and Robin Lopez, who is exceeding expectations, Portland finally has a team that is coming together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Clippers, B</p>\n<p>The Clippers are right where they’re supposed to be, atop the Pacific Division. While the defense needs to improve, Chris Paul continues to show why he’s the best point guard in the NBA, averaging 19.6 points and a league-leading 11.2 assists per game. However, Paul is now out for three to five weeks with a shoulder injury and without its glue, L.A. must show it can still win games. Blake Griffin, who is currently averaging a team-high 22 points per game, will be critical. L.A. has plenty of role players on this team, so if they can play well, the Clippers should be able to manage until Paul’s return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Rockets, B</p>\n<p>Houston has dealt with inconsistency this season, losing to bad teams like Utah and Sacramento. Yet, the Rockets could be a great team going further into the season. Of course, the Rockets should be winning games with two of the best players in the game. James Harden is having another fantastic year, having his way with opponents’ defense, averaging 24.4 points per game. In the middle, Dwight Howard has returned to more of the dominant center fans know. Howard is giving the Rockets 17.8 points, 12.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. Along with Chandler Parsons and Jeremy Lin this is a team with plenty of firepower.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Golden State Warriors, B+</p>\n<p>The Warriors aren’t atop the Western Conference right now, but they’re always dangerous and have won eight straight games. They’ve dealt with small injuries along the way to Stephan Curry and Andre Iguodala, but scoring will never be a problem on this team, which features the most dangerous backcourt in the game right now. Curry is averaging 23.3 points per game while Klay Thompson is tallying 19.3 points per contest. David Lee has stepped up too, giving the Warriors 18.9 points per game. Defensively, Golden State has Iguodala and Andrew Bogut to keep opponents in check, so if healthy, they could go far this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Phoenix Suns, A</p>\n<p>Nobody thought Phoenix would be a playoff team. Most, including myself, thought the Suns would be a cellar dweller in the West. We were all wrong. Currently in the seventh seed, Phoenix is in the top 10 in the NBA in scoring, putting up 103.7 points per game. The reason for that can be found in Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. Bledsoe, the understudy of Chris Paul last season, has spread his wings, averaging 18.0 points and 5.8 assists. Dragic is averaging slightly better numbers, tallying 18.8 points and 5.9 assists. The pair of guards has made Phoenix a playoff team and a huge surprise this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dallas Mavericks, B</p>\n<p>When your team has Dirk Nowitzki, you always have a good chance of making the playoffs. The veteran forward is not showing signs of age by any means, putting up 21.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. He’s shooting 48.8 percent from the field, 40.8 percent from behind the arc and 92.0 percent from the free throw line. With Monta Ellis also making a big impact, averaging 20.2 points per game, there isn’t one player defenses can focus on. Defense might not be this team’s strength, but Nowitzki is a veteran player, making Dallas a team nobody can overlook.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Timberwolves, B-</p>\n<p>Kevin Love has been a monster on the court this year. Averaging 26.4 points (second-best in the NBA) and 13.5 rebounds per game, Love has been consistent, putting numbers on the board night in and night out. Kevin Martin and Nikola Pekovic also keep the defense busy, tallying 19.8 and 18.0 points per game, respectively. So the offense is strong in Minnesota. The problem keeping the T-Wolves out of the playoff picture? Defense. The team gives up 102.9 points per game, fourth-highest in the NBA. Yet, the Timberwolves are currently just one spot out of the playoffs, so this is a team not to give up on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Denver Nuggets, C+</p>\n<p>There’s one name to know in Denver: Ty Lawson. With Andre Iguodala gone, Lawson knows this is officially his team, and has put up the numbers to prove it, averaging 17.7 points and 8.1 assists per game. His teammates have matched his energy and the team has plenty of threats from behind the arc. Nevertheless, I don’t see this as a team that makes the playoffs. They simply don’t play good enough defense to be a top-eight contender.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New Orleans Pelicans, B-</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has stepped up big for New Orleans this season. The power forward continues to spread the opponents’ defense, shooting 40.9 percent from three-point range. Overall, he’s averaging an impressive 19.8 points per game. The problem for the Pelicans is that last week, Anderson went down with a neck injury and is still undergoing tests in Boston. The Pelicans do have Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans, all of which are capable of putting up big numbers, but without Anderson, this team will struggle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Memphis Grizzlies, C-</p>\n<p>It seems like the Grizzlies have always been known for their defense. And they still are, holding opponents to 97.5 points per game. Defense will win a lot of ball games, but to win, you also have to be able to score points. Mike Conley has found his stride on the offensive end, giving the Grizzlies a solid 17.3 points per game. Zach Randolph has also done his job for Memphis this season, leading the team with 17.1 points per game. Yet, the Grizzlies are still on the bottom end of the NBA in scoring. This may change when Marc Gasol returns, but the Grizzlies need to find an answer now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Lakers, B+</p>\n<p>The Lakers have to be wondering how they could receive so much bad luck in one season. Many teams have suffered injuries, but none as many as L.A. First, superstar Kobe Bryant returned from his torn Achilles tendon. Six games later, he injured his knee and will be out for extended time. Steve Nash has also only played in six games. He is one of a handful of point guards the Lakers have gone through. L.A. has gone deep into its D-League team with the only recognizable name left on the Lakers being Pau Gasol. With so much uncertainty and so many roster changes, Head Coach Mike D’Antoni requires a lot of credit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sacramento Kings, D</p>\n<p>In a rebuilding year, star DeMarcus Cousins has proved himself a premier center in the NBA, averaging 23.2 points and 11.4 rebounds, but Cousins still has a lot of maturing to do as he currently leads the league in technicals. Isaiah Thomas has also stepped up, adding 19.3 points and 6.2 assists per contest. The recently acquired Rudy Gay has been great thus far, putting up 19.5 points per game. But offense isn’t the problem. Despite Head Coach Michael Malone preaching defense, Sacramento still gives up 104.5 points to its opponent, second-worst in the NBA. The formula for improvement is pretty simple: play defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Utah Jazz, D+</p>\n<p>Compared to most NBA teams, Utah doesn’t have much talent, lacking a huge NBA star. Therefore, the team wasn’t expected to win big. Nevertheless, with the worst record in the West, it’s not possible to give this team a passing grade. In what was supposed to be a developmental year for the Jazz, Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors have been decent for the Jazz, averaging 16.5 and 13.5 points per game, respectively, but the Jazz need more from Trey Burke. The highly-anticipated rookie that slipped to the ninth pick in the draft has struggled with consistency despite averaging 13.3 points and 5.2 assists. Right now, the Jazz would have a good shot in the lottery, which looks to have several franchise-changing players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53394\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53394\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/","id":3246,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[3245,3244,3243],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Serving It Up in the Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.23.2013-UCSB-Womens-Volleyball-vs-UCR-16.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.23.2013-UCSB-Womens-Volleyball-vs-UCR-16.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces No. 9-seed San Diego in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the first time since 2009, the UCSB women’s volleyball team is in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>After finishing off their regular season with a 3-1 victory over UC Irvine, the Gauchos earned their first Big West championship since 2005, sharing it with No. 17 Hawaii and Cal State Northridge, and will travel to No. 14 San Diego for their first playoff match on Friday.</p>\n<p>“It’s an incredible honor to be one of only 64 teams represented in the NCAA tournament.

The Toreros, whose overall record of 24-3 was good enough to earn them the No. 9 seed in the tournament, defeated Santa Barbara, 3-0, back on Sep. 14.</p>\n<p>“I was kind of shocked after finding out we were playing them because I thought we were going to have a better seed in the bracket,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “But I was also super excited because they were the last team that swept us, so that definitely left an imprint on our brains. All we want to do now is go out and get some revenge on them.”</p>\n<p>After enduring a tough preseason, UCSB found something special right at the perfect time. The Gauchos went 13-2 over their final 15 matches, ending the season with a record at 18-10 overall and 13-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With its impressive regular season now concluded, UCSB’s outstanding play over the course of the season was acknowledged this past week with a remarkable five players named to the All-Big West teams.</p>\n<p>“I could not have asked for my teammates to play any better [this season],” Thompson said. “Every game, every practice they stepped up and took the challenge that we had in front of us and killed it.”</p>\n<p>Senior libero Leah Sully, who became UCSB’s all-time digs leader last weekend, was named to the All-Big West First Team along with Thompson and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau. Freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt, who was named the Big West Freshman of the Year, also earned a spot on the First Team, and freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt was given an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>“For us to have so much representation on the All-Big West team was certainly something that shows how far we’ve come this year,” Lantagne Welch said. “Our results, obviously being tri-champions, and just having such a balanced team really showed in the All-Conference results.”</p>\n<p>Although USD dominated UCSB in the teams’ previous matchup, the Gauchos believe that they are a different team this time around.</p>\n<p>“Beating No. 5 Hawaii pretty much gave us the confidence to feel like we can take anyone down, so we’re not afraid,” Spindt said. “I don’t think they know what we’re [capable of].”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has had great success against ranked teams this year, not only with its upset over Hawaii but also with two victories over the previously-No. 24 ranked Northridge. However, the Gauchos will need to be sharp in every aspect in order to come away with another upset.</p>\n<p>“[San Diego is] an excellent defensive team and their floor defense is what really shines,” Lantagne Welch said. “The biggest key for us is serving tough, and in addition we need to be sharp offensively and take advantage defensively when we get them out of system.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be looking to the trio of Thompson, Spindt and Barbeau to carry them on the offensive end. Thompson’s 3.25 kills per set average was good enough for third best in the Big West this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also look to its defensive trio of Sully, Grunt and freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg to try and slow down the fast paced Toreros offense. Sully finished the year with the most digs in the Big West despite only starting the last 16 matches at libero, while Grunt and Sullberg finished in first and third in blocks per set, respectively.</p>\n<p>“They run a very quick offense and they are very heavy with their middle and right side attack,” Lantagne Welch said. “That’s their bread and butter, so we need to be able to slow that down by serving tough, blocking well, and playing good defense.”</p>\n<p>San Diego’s fierce offense is powered by one of the most balanced attacks in the nation with five players averaging 2.67 or more kills per set. Senior middle hitters Chloe Ferrari and Katie Hoekman lead the way for their team with incredible hitting percentages of .435 and .383, respectively. Ferrari will be the main emphasis for the Gauchos’ defense, as she was voted the 2013 WCC Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to approach it as any other game, but we’re super focused,” Spindt said. “Obviously we’re going to be extra pumped since we’re playing on such a big stage and we have this great opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos owe much of their success this year to Lantagne Welch, whose efforts in her first season as the team’s head coach earned her a Big West Co-Coach of the Year Award. After five trips to the NCAA tournament while coaching the University of Miami, her experience will surely be a boost for a young roster which, with the exception of Sully, has never played an NCAA tournament match.</p>\n<p>“She pushed us and influenced us in such positive ways,” Thompson said. Without her, I don’t think we could’ve made it to the NCAAs.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s match is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. at Jenny Craig Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/","id":5286,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5285,5284,5283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downed by NAU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos get blown out 79-56","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Typically the UCSB women’s basketball team is known for its defense.</p>\n<p>It’s how the Gauchos have won games the last two seasons.

On the game, Northern Arizona shot 56.9 percent, including 62.5 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>“54 points in the paint – I think that’s the average number of points we gave up last year total,” Mitchell said. “Some of it was post defense on the weak side. We got caught behind on that and the second part of that is the screen and roll defense because we were getting beat to the middle of the lane on dribble penetration on the screen and roll. We just had breakdowns in every aspect of our man to man defense.”</p>\n<p>Despite holding the Lumberjack’s biggest offensive threat in senior guard Amanda Frost to 13 points, over seven points less than her season average, UCSB had no answer for junior forward Erikka Banks. One of five players in double figures, Banks totaled a double-double with 23 points on 9-11 shooting and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos were outrebounded 39-26, leading to an 18-6 second chance points advantage for Northern Arizona.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t block out. That’s just basic fundamentals of what we do,” Mitchell said. “As good as we’ve been against bigger teams – I thought we did a decent job against San Diego State and we did a decent job against a bigger, stronger, athletic Arizona team – we went away from all the fundamental principles tonight of doing the little things you have to do to win. They wanted it more than us tonight.”</p>\n<p>During the first half, Santa Barbara found a way to stay in the game due to its proficient shooting. Senior guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 13 of her 17 points and as a team, the Gauchos shot 42.9 from the field, allowing Santa Barbara to head into the locker rooms with the game knotted up at 30-30.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB went ice cold to begin the second half, going 1-7 from the field, which led to a 13-0 run by the Lumberjacks. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the shooting woes didn’t improve with time as the Gauchos shot a dismal 29.6 percent in the second half and were outscored 49-26.</p>\n<p>“In the second half, there was just no energy. I think from the beginning of the game there was no energy, but at least the first half we were hitting some shots,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “The second half, it seemed like we just stopped and gave up.”</p>\n<p>With the loss, Santa Barbara falls to 4-4 overall while NAU improves to 2-2 on the year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>A wearing schedule, five of Santa Barbara’s seven games have been decided in the final minutes. UCSB has gone 3-2 in those games.</p>\n<p>Tuesday night on the road at Pepperdine was no exception as UCSB overcame a 14-point first-half deficit to earn the 77-69 victory and the team’s second consecutive road win.</p>\n<p>“It was good for us to finally find ways to win. That’s going to be big for us because we do have a bit of inexperience on this team and as we continue to do that it will really help us,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We just battled. We had a tough first half and we could have quit after that, but we kept at it and knew what we had to do to pull that win out.”</p>\n<p>For the second straight game, Nesbit set a new career high, totaling 26 points on 8-15 shooting. This season, she averages 18.6 points per game and has been extremely efficient, shooting 47.9 percent from the field, including 51.9 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>All three seniors have been critical for the Gauchos this season with senior guard Destini Mason averaging 15.9 points and a team-leading 6.7 rebounds per game and senior guard Melissa Zornig averaging 12.6 points and a team-high 3.6 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with the seniors pulling their weight, Mitchell was waiting for one more player to step up. Against Pepperdine, Santa Barbara received that bench production, with junior guard Kristine Brance giving eight second-half points and five rebounds and sophomore guard Jasmine Ware tallying six points and providing plenty of defensive pressure. This allowed Mitchell to give her seniors a few extra minutes of rest, which is crucial with so many games in such a small period of time.</p>\n<p>“[Tuesday] we were able to trust Kris, Jasmine and [freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright] to give us at least 10 or 15 minutes and produce while they were out there, so I think that was instrumental,” Mitchell said. “It’s critical any time you can get Nic, Mel and Destini to be around the 30-minute mark. That only helps their production and will help us down the road as far as their legs and how many minutes we may need them to play down the stretch.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns home tonight with a 4-3 overall record. NAU, meanwhile, comes to the Thunderdome with a 1-2 mark.</p>\n<p>While the Lumberjacks are a balanced team, they should be a good matchup for the Gauchos as NAU lacks the height UCSB has seen in its last few games.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team,” Nesbit said. “They don’t have as much size as we’ve seen in the past, but they have thicker guards that are going to be more physical and I’m sure will try to post us up. We’re going to see a bit of a different team than we have in the past.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Amanda Frost anchors Northern Arizona’s offense, averaging 21.7 points per game. In the team’s most recent victory over Utah Valley, Frost went off for 30 points.</p>\n<p>Another key matchup for UCSB will be junior forward Erikka Banks, who grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds in the team’s win. On the year, she averages a double-double with 10.3 points and 12.7 boards.</p>\n<p>“Banks is an interesting match-up because she’s 6’0’’, but she’s really a guard averaging 13 rebounds a game. She’s just a competitor,” Mitchell said. “Frost I would probably relate to Mel. She can shoot it, she can put it on the floor, and then around the basket she has euro step throughs, so she scores in a variety of ways.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, rebounding will be important for UCSB tomorrow A statistic that consistently predicts the result on the scoreboard, the Gauchos average 38.2 rebounds when they win compared to 25.3 boards when they lose.</p>\n<p>The other key factor for Santa Barbara will be turnovers. This season, UCSB averages an impressive 12.6 giveaways per game. On the other hand, the Gauchos would like to take advantage of the Lumberjacks’ turnovers as Northern Arizona has struggled with throwing the ball away, averaging 20 per game in its three games so far.</p>\n<p>“We’re making less mental mistakes,” Nesbit said. “Being aggressive, the turnovers we can live with are the ones in transition where you try to make something happen, but I think we’re starting to limit the unforced turnovers that happen for no reason. We’re playing a bit smarter and that’s something that’s really valuable for us right now.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/","id":590,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[589,588,587],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Cal For First Time Since 1979","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-18.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-18.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts Cal on Friday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After falling to UCLA in a competitive game on Tuesday, the UCSB men’s basketball team will face yet another tough opponent when it hosts Cal tomorrow at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the matchup with a 3-3 record after falling to the No. 19 Bruins 89-76.

With Williams, Santa Barbara is 3-1, the lone loss coming to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“We’re encouraged by the fact that we can compete in a game like this in the future. We had a good shot at putting them away and getting the upset,” Boswell said. “We have to take out the positive things because we have a huge game on Friday against Cal coming to our place. We just know that we can play with anyone and we’ve proven that this year.”</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, UCSB did not look like a team from a smaller conference facing a power conference team. Instead, Santa Barbara battled for the majority of the game, taking a 42-42 tie into the half at legendary Pauley Pavilion. UCSB even led in the second half before a run by the Bruins put the game out of reach. Big Al led the Gauchos with 23 points to go along with eight rebounds, but the outside shooting of UCSB was the real storyline in this game.</p>\n<p>Boswell finished with 18 points shooting 5-9 from behind the arc. Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Bryson and junior guard Zalmico Harmon each shot 3-5 from the three while sophomore forward Taran Brown was 2-6. Overall, UCSB shot 50 percent on threes, including an impressive 9-14 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of good shooters on the perimeter surrounding Al down low, so if we’re not hitting threes and having people close down on us hard, we’re going to go inside,” Boswell said. “If we go inside and they’re doubling Al, we’re going to kick it out. We have a lot of inside-outside game that we pride ourselves on, especially with two quick point guards that can get into the lane.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to another Pac-12 opponent, UCSB hosts a Golden Bears’ squad that defeated Big West team UC Irvine 73-56 on Monday. Senior guard Justin Cobbs leads Cal with 14 points and over six assists per game. Senior forward Richard Solomon will provide a formidable opponent down low against Big Al, as the senior averages a double-double with over 11 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly has the weapons to challenge the Golden Bears, led by Big Al’s Big West leading numbers of 27.5 points, 10.8 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. Bryson ranks second on the team with 12.7 points per game, while Boswell is third at 11 points and Brown fourth at 10.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup against Cal looms as the Gauchos biggest nonconference home game of the season.</p>\n<p>“[A victory against Cal] would be huge. UCLA was a really big team and that just showed us just how dominant Big Al is,” Boswell said. “We nearly beat Utah State and Colorado even without Al, so the fact that he’s going to be a presence on Friday, they’re going to have to pick their spots. He’s going to cause a lot of problems for Cal so hopefully we’ll take advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s tip-off against Cal is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We’re starting to find ways to win and I’m really, really enjoying that,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “It’s always really fun when you have girls that are willing to battle it out for 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Down the stretch, the Gauchos’ seniors stepped up and made clutch free throws, going 10-10 from the line. Tied at 67 with just over a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig was fouled on her shot. She hit both free throws to give her team a two point lead and then Nesbit was fouled on her drive nearly a minute later, resulting in a four point advantage for UCSB after she drained both her foul shots. The two possession game would prove too much for the Waves to overcome.</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive game, Nesbit set a new career-high, tallying 26 points in the victory.</p>\n<p>“She’s just a warrior,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think sometimes against zones she gets hesitant, so I just challenged her to take over and that’s not a first for her anymore. Now she knows she can do whatever it takes for us to win and she shouldn’t feel bad if she needs to take 20, 10 or 50 shots for us to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 4-3 overall, including 1-2 on the road, while Pepperdine drops to 2-6.</p>\n<p>“We had an attack mentality,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes in the past, our team has played not to lose instead of playing to win and I think our kids tonight knew they were going to win the game.”</p>\n<p>While the score might resemble a solid game by the Gauchos, the majority of the first half looked just the opposite for Santa Barbara. Grabbing 10 offensive rebounds and taking advantage of nine UCSB turnovers, Pepperdine jumped out to an early double-digit lead.</p>\n<p>The nine first half turnovers were only 3.5 less than the team’s season average of 12.5 per contest. However, UCSB gave the ball away just four times in the second half.</p>\n<p>“I think we were all kind of shaky (in the first half),” Zornig said. “When we play teams that play a zone, a lot of times we stand still and we freeze and a lot of times we panic and don’t know what to do.”</p>\n<p>Rather than waiting for the halftime break to regroup, UCSB found its stride with 2:13 to go in the first half. A jumper by Destini Mason sparked a 10-2 run to end the half, which was extended to a 17-4 to begin the second half, closing the gap to one point only two minutes into the second half.</p>\n<p>With a variety of players giving quality minutes in the second half, the Gauchos grinded out their second consecutive road victory. Mason and Zornig both came close to totaling double-doubles, combining for 29 points and 17 rebounds while junior guard Kristine Brance added eight points, all of which came in the second half, and five rebounds. Sophomore guard Jasmine Ware also contributed six points and five boards.</p>\n<p>“It was a great win. I’m not going to hesitate on that one,” Mitchell said. “We got critical minutes off our bench. Nic, Mel and Destini have been really consistent in their play, but we can’t win when they’re having to play 40 minutes a game, so tonight we were able to trust Kristine, Jasmine and [freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright] to give us at least 10 or 15 minutes and produce while they were out there, so I think that was instrumental that we had all nine players getting minutes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB receives just one day of rest before returning home to play Northern Arizona Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/","id":593,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[592,591,590],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels South to Face Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos try to rebound from 71-67 loss to SDSU tonight against Pepperdine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team’s ability to have short term memory will be tested this week.</p>\n<p>Just three days off a rough loss to San Diego State, the Gauchos play Pepperdine on the road tonight, the first of two games in the next three days.</p>\n<p>“We take each game game by game,” freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “It sucks to lose, but we have to let it go and move forward because we do have other games.

Even then, senior guard Nicole Nesbit was given a wide-open three to tie the game in the few second remaining, but missed.</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team with a career-high 22 points. Moving over to the shooting guard position this season, Nesbit currently ranks third in the Big West in scoring with 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“When you play the point, the mentality is to pass first, shoot second,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Onome’s thought process is to dribble penetrate and get everyone else involved, so that frees up Nic and allows her to have legs late in the game because she’s not having to handle the ball against pressure for 40 minutes. In critical moments, she knows and understands we want the ball in her hands.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB shot a season-high 9-19 from three point range, in the second half, the team began settling for jumpers instead of attacking the rim, playing into the tactics of the Aztecs, who played a zone defense.</p>\n<p>Tonight, Santa Barbara will see a zone once again against Pepperdine, who will look to pack the paint.</p>\n<p>“Zones are so different for people and sometimes I smile and sometimes I want to pull my hair out because when you have players that can dribble penetrate and can shoot, they have all the different elements, but there’s something about a zone that sometimes makes them hesitant,” Mitchell said. “When you’re playing one on one or man defense, it’s a lot easier to use your skill or ability to either create your own shot or create for others. Zones make everyone have to be on the same page.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine enters tonight’s matchup at 2-5. Losers of four straight games, all of which were on the road, the Waves return home in need of a victory.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good team. We have seen some very talented individuals so far, but I think Pepperdine is the team that is the best overall team in understanding their roles and playing well together,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced, play inside-out, they have skilled players as well as athletes, and they’re battle-tested.

One of eight players on the roster listed at six feet or taller, she led SDSU to a phenomenal 65.9 percent shooting performance from the field, including 70.6 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>Down four, Warren stepped outside and knocked down a three to bring her team within one at 45-44. She went on to score San Diego State’s next eight points to give the Aztecs a one point advantage just over halfway through the second half.</p>\n<p>“[Warren] started out at North Carolina. We know she could’ve played anywhere in the country,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’ll have to go back and look at when she scored and how she scored. If we were in man, really the only body type that could match up against her was Big Mel.”</p>\n<p>Despite the Aztec shooting percentage, the Gauchos’ three point shooting kept them in the game. Ranked last in the Big West in threes with just 16 on the year entering the game, UCSB made over half its season total in one game, shooting nine of 19 from behind the arc for 47.4 percent.</p>\n<p>“We were getting wide open looks, but I think more towards the second half, we were taking shots too quickly and weren’t attacking as much as we should have,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “The mentality we should have had from the beginning was to attack.”</p>\n<p>The supremacy by both teams in their respective styles led to a game that would be decided in the final seconds.</p>\n<p>Down six with a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig hit a three to bring the game within one possession. A steal on the inbounds and a converted layup from Nesbit completed a five-point swing, making a game that seemed over anybody’s game.</p>\n<p>“We were just trying to pressure it,” Zornig said. “We wanted to get the ball back. We wanted to press them and see what we could do with it.”</p>\n<p>In its full court press, UCSB forced SDSU to travel and was given the opportunity to take the lead with 48.5 seconds left in the game, but could not create a good shot on the offensive end. On the miss, Santa Barbara was forced to foul and freshman guard Ariell Bostick made one of two free throws to put her team up three.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, Nesbit, who had been hot from distance at 5-7 from behind the arc at the time, received an open look from the left wing, but the three bounced off the back of the iron.</p>\n<p>“We drew it up and knew we needed a look at a three,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the first shot, so Mel came in. She took a look at it and then I did get a good look. We did get the look we wanted. It just didn’t go in.”</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs improve to 1-4, the Gauchos drop to 3-3.</p>\n<p>“With the competitor I am, it’s disappointing to know that’s their first win of the season. That’s frustrating when you’re at home,” Mitchell said. “We had our opportunities. We went into halftime up six and we turned stagnant against that two-three zone (in the second half) and it cost us.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB shot 52.0 percent on the game and had three players in double-figures. Nesbit finished with a game-high and career-high 22 points while senior guard Destini Mason and Zornig tallied with 20 and 14 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We had three players in double figures, but again, it’s our guards,” Mitchell said. “We have to find someone else to give us a scoring punch so [the seniors] don’t have to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to rebound quickly from the loss as they travel to Pepperdine Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A turnover on the other end led to a trey by senior guard Melissa Zornig and a steal and layup in transition from sophomore guard Jasmine Ware completed an 8-0 run for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The increased defensive intensity started by Mason led to a 17-3 run and the Gauchos eventually took a 34-24 lead into the locker room.</p>\n<p>“I think it was our energy on defense that really helped get our offense going,” Ware said. “I think we started talking because we were a little flat in the beginning.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB would give up its lead as Hampton used offensive rebounds to spark a 15-4 run and tie the game at 39 all. In just the first five minutes of the second half, the Lady Pirates grabbed eight offensive boards, which led to nine second chance points.</p>\n<p>On the game, Santa Barbara was outrebounded 46-30, giving up 24 offensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They are amazing athletes and we knew their second, third and fourth opportunity a lot of times is their best shot,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t do a good job of blocking out. No excuses. We are very lucky to win giving up 24 offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>The rest of the half, the two teams traded baskets and for the fourth time this year, the Gauchos played in a game went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>Down two with just over a minute remaining, freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe poked the ball from one of Hampton’s leaders, senior guard Nicole Hamilton, and fed Mason on the fast break, who not only converted the layup, but earned the foul. With the made free throw, Mason gave UCSB a 61-60 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a really hard foul. I was a little hurt, but my teammates were like, ‘it doesn’t really matter. You’re going to have to knock down this free throw,’” Mason said. “I just had to get up and focus on the free throw.”</p>\n<p>Solid defense from the Gauchos on the next possession forced an air ball from Hamilton and the Gauchos were able to finish the Lady Pirates off from the line, going 5-6 down the stretch from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 3-2 on the year while Hampton falls to an identical 3-2 mark.</p>\n<p>Anchoring the team offensively for the Lady Pirates was Bennett, who finished the night with 23 points, 21 coming in the second half, and 16 rebounds. She was one of three players in double-figures for Hampton.</p>\n<p>“It was a really nice win,” Mitchell said. “They’re a very talented team. They probably have a pro player in Alyssa Bennett and even though she ended up with 23 points, we made her work extremely hard for those 23 points, so it’s a great win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to play this Saturday at home against San Diego State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/","id":586,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[585,584,583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One NBA Star on His Way Back, Another Out for the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Recovering Kobe Bryant Inks an Extension While Rose Goes Down Again After Just 11 Games","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Two huge stories broke yesterday that will dramatically alter the landscape of the NBA for at least the next two years.</p>\n<p>First, tragic news from Chicago validated Bulls fans’ worst nightmare: After missing all of the 2012-13 season with a torn ACL in his left knee, Derrick Rose’s comeback campaign was abruptly ended with news that he will miss all of 2013-14 with a torn meniscus in his right knee.</p>\n<p>Across the country, Laker fans got the first bit of good news on Kobe Bryant since he returned to practice.

A torn Achilles tendon can be a career-ender, especially for veterans like the 35-year-old Bryant.</p>\n<p>However, if there is any player that can do it, I’d bet my money on Kobe Bean Bryant. The man’s competitive drive and dedication to improvement is unmatched by any contemporary athlete not named Michael Jordan. He has played through broken fingers, tweaked wrists and ravaged knees. An injury to his foot is just the latest challenge to overcome, and Kobe has shown for years and years that he doesn’t mind taking some physical punishment.</p>\n<p>However, the basketball gods can be cruel. As an old man continues to defy the odds and return to prominence, a young man with all the talent in the world has his potential taken away with a simple buckle of his knee.</p>\n<p>Rose has the potential to be every bit as good of a player as Kobe is, if not better. Rose was better than Kobe at a younger age, and has a work ethic that compares. Unfortunately, NBA fans will have to wait another year to see if Rose is the same player he once was, and the question must be asked if we will ever get the pleasure of watching him dominate the game offensively again.</p>\n<p>If there is a silver lining for Bulls fans, it’s that the meniscus was salvaged and repaired via surgery, and Rose is expected to be able to make a full recovery. The results of the surgery show that the injury is not as severe as the torn ACL was, and Rose managed to come back from that in the best physical shape of his life. Rose never quite found his rhythm this year, but the athleticism was back.</p>\n<p>There is still hope that Rose can return next season and become the MVP-caliber player that he was before the injuries. He was a 22-year-old MVP and is only 25 today, still yet to reach his prime years. But to the average observer, playing like an MVP after two missed seasons in a row due to knee injuries is a hard scenario to imagine. If the Bulls’ locker room atmosphere is any indication, we could have just witnessed a Hall of Fame-worthy career deteriorate before our very eyes.</p>\n<p>But keep in mind, the last player to win an MVP award besides LeBron James was Derrick Rose. To doubt his return to greatness is to tempt the competitive spirit of a man who was seemingly born to be a champion. Rose has elite, athletic DNA, and his triumphant return would be a testament to his greatness and to the achievements of modern sports medicine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/","id":3242,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3241,3240,3239],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tries for Two in a Row at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos take on Hampton at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Many students are heading home for Thanksgiving right now, but for the UCSB women’s basketball team, there is business to be taken care of over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>After spending last weekend on the road, the Gauchos return home for a two-game home stand, taking on Hampton tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is currently 2-2 on the year.

With a final score of 67-62, the Gauchos found a way to come from behind after trailing the entire first half.</p>\n<p>“From this game, we learned we need to bring energy from the start,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “I feel that game wouldn’t have been close if we’d started the game with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>As a shorter team, one highlight was the team’s ability to contain the Broncos’ pair of 6’4’’ centers.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know that Santa Clara had two 6’4’’ players on the floor most of the night and I think we were only outrebounded by one,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Our post defense was much better. We’re finding different ways to win and all our players are contributing.”</p>\n<p>To secure the victory, the trio of Gaucho seniors put the team on their backs, combining for 50 of 67 points. This season, senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Destini Mason and Zornig have combined for 65.3 percent of the team’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Zornig especially found her stride over the weekend, posting 19 points and a career-high nine assists against St. Mary’s, and then scoring 18 against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig is] finding different ways to score,” Mitchell said. “I think early in the year, she was taking a lot of threes and at times they weren’t falling. Now, she has that attack mentality of, ‘Hey, if my three’s not falling, I own the midrange jumper,’ and then also being able to get into the lane and being able to draw fouls.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB settles into the season, one note of improvement the Gauchos will be looking for this week is consistency, as the team has, on multiple occasions this year, started out slow and had to come from behind.</p>\n<p>“We need to understand that we have the ability to close out games and put two halves together and sustain that energy,” Nesbit said. “We need to play as a team because it’s going to take all of us.”</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Hampton will rely on its defense, averaging 66 points per game while holding teams to 57.8 points per game.

After a lethargic start that saw the Highlanders score 11 of their first 13 points off of UCSB errors, Santa Barbara cleaned up its act and took over for the rest of the match. Leading 15-14 in the first set, the Gauchos went on an 8-0 run to pull away, led by senior opposite Katey Thompson. With set point, Thompson picked up her fifth kill of the first set to give her team a 25-16 win.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of errors in the first half of the first set and when you do that any team’s going to be in the match and feel good about how things are going,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “They were giving us things defensively that we needed to take advantage of and we started to do that.”</p>\n<p>Right from the start of the second set UCSB showed just how outmatched their opponents from Riverside were, as they jumped out to a 12-2 lead highlighted by three straight blocks by freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg and sophomore opposite Jaylen Villanueva. UCSB kept the pressure on, hitting at a remarkable .583 clip in the set, and a final kill by Villanueva gave the Gauchos a 25-13 win and 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“Our focus sharpened up a little [in the second set],” Lantagne Welch said. “We were able to [come up with] some ideas where we could score more effectively. We became a little more deceptive with our setting and our hitters started to get into a groove.”</p>\n<p>The third and final set was more of the same as a second 8-0 run put UCSB up 15-5. Thompson hit the final kill in front of home fans, giving the Gauchos a 25-15 victory and a sweep. This was the last career home game for Thompson as well as for senior liberos Kara Sherrard and Leah Sully.</p>\n<p>“It’s surreal; I don’t think it’s hit any of us yet,” Sully said. “I’m just glad that we had a good team effort tonight and we could pull out a win.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s match against Fullerton, the Gauchos had one of their most efficient nights offensively, hitting at a .303 clip. After winning a tough first set 25-22, UCSB came out to dominate the second set, 25-18.</p>\n<p>Fullerton tried to extend the match, but a 16-15 lead in the third set. The Gauchos reeled off seven straight points, including three straight service aces by Sherrard, and eventually won the set 25-21 on a Thompson kill.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces Long Beach on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/","id":5293,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5292,5291,5290],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Santa Clara on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-basketball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-basketball.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB snapped a two-game skid on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>What a 67-62 final score says is that the UCSB women’s basketball team beat Santa Clara Saturday night, earning its first road victory of the year.

With 17.3 seconds remaining on the clock, the Broncos almost came up with the steal, tipping the ball out of bounds. On the second chance, UCSB was forced to call a timeout, unable to inbound the ball.</p>\n<p>“We had a press set that should’ve given us three options, but they did a good job of denying Nic,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Then, we went to trying to have Destini get open as well, but they had a lot of pressure on the ball. They had 6’4’’ on the ball, so it had to be a bounce pass to get the ball inbounds.”</p>\n<p>On the third shot, the Gauchos successfully inbounded to Nesbit, the team’s top free throw shooter, who went 4-4 from the free throw line down the stretch to ice the game.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done this hundreds and hundreds of times, probably thousands,” Nesbit said. “You can’t worry about the atmosphere; nothing’s different about it.”</p>\n<p>The win snaps a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos as they improve to 2-2. With the loss, Santa Clara falls to 0-4.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely exciting to get that first road win,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We came in there upset from the last game (against St. Mary’s) and we went in there to fight tonight. We really wanted to win the game, so we went out with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s seniors took the reins in earning their team its first road victory, combining for 50 of the Gauchos’ 67 points. Nesbit, Zornig and Mason finished with 19, 18 and 13 points, respectively. Mason also tallied 10 rebounds for her first double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors stepped up and made critical plays,” Mitchell said. “They didn’t shoot it the best, but Mel found ways to get to the free throw line, Destini got crucial second-chance opportunities late in the game and Nic was able to keep the ball and knock down big free throws late.”</p>\n<p>The biggest difference for the Gauchos was in the turnover category. UCSB turned the ball over just nine times, compared to Santa Clara’s 21 giveaways, leading to 26-6 advantage in points off turnovers. UCSB was also able to contain Santa Clara’s height inside, limiting their two 6’4’’ players to 14 combined points.</p>\n<p>“We stress our defense,” Nesbit said. “We knew going into this game they had a couple legit 6’4’’ players, so we knew we were going to have to full front. You can’t play behind them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Hampton tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/","id":617,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[616,615,614],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss to Penn State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Soccer.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Soccer.jpg?resize=840%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Injuries and red cards plagued UCSB Sunday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a promising and historic year, the No. 10 UCSB men’s soccer team’s season came to an end Sunday night in a 1-0 loss to Penn State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finishes the season with a final overall record of 12-6-3 after a historic undefeated 7-0-3 mark in the Big West.

A red card to senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden in the sixth minute of the game did not help the shorthanded Gauchos as UCSB was forced to play a man down for basically the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>“Fifi was the only player on the field that has played in an NCAA playoff game,” Vom Steeg said. “Seven minutes in we went down to zero players that have played in a playoff game.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing a man down, UCSB controlled the ball for much of the first half and matched Penn State with three first half shots apiece. Both teams went into the half scoreless.</p>\n<p>The second half proved to be the difference for the Nittany Lions as freshman forward Connor Maloney gave Penn State a 1-0 lead with a strike from 18 yards out in the 78th minute. Penn State finished the night with 10 shots compared to just four for UCSB, including a four-to-one advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, [we’re] very disappointed to lose a goal. When we went down, it was just roll your sleeves up and fight and it’s what we’ve done all year,” senior defender Daniel Welsh said. “It’s a season to build on for next year for the guys who are coming back. I’m very happy the way it’s all ended in a way in a way, disappointed obviously at the same time.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Achille Campion returned from injury to add an offensive weapon for the Gauchos. UCSB was still without three starters, however, as senior defender Peter Schmetz sat due to injury, and freshman midfielder Drew Murphy and junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez both missed Sunday’s game because of drawn red cards.</p>\n<p>Losing Baiden to a red card early in the match certainly dealt a big blow to an already depleted Gaucho roster.</p>\n<p>“Fifi, I thought, was going to have to be the most important player on the field for us to win tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “Obviously, that call dramatically changed [the game].”</p>\n<p>Penn State defeated St. Francis Brooklyn 1-0 on Thursday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament while the Gauchos received a first-round bye as one of the top-16 ranked teams.</p>\n<p>“We have enough on this field if our seniors show up to go win this game tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “Our seniors did show up tonight, and they showed up in a big way, but we gave up the one shot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will next play in August 2014.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53254\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53254\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/","id":1570,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1569,1568,1567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops First Road Game of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos fall 89-79 to the Gaels","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has proved itself an offensive force this year, but the Gauchos still couldn’t keep up with the potent offense of St. Mary’s as they fell 89-79 yesterday in their first road game of the season.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara scored the second most points during the Carlene Mitchell era with 79, the 89 points the Gauchos gave up was the most since Mitchell’s arrival to UCSB.

The Gaels were 6-8 from behind the arc and 21-28 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen a team shoot 63 percent from the field, so that was rough,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I don’t think we were as sharp as we couldn’t been defensively.”</p>\n<p>The options were plentiful for St. Mary’s on the offensive end as the team ended the night with four players in double figures. Leading the offense were senior guard Kate Gaze and sophomore guard Lauren Nicholson, who on the season only average 11.7 and 10.7 points per game, respectively. However, with Nared on the bench, the guards stepped up, tallying 26 points apiece. Danielle Mauldin also added a double-double with 18 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They have balanced scoring, so there’s not just one player that can get it done,” Mitchell said. “You have to give them credit for finding the mismatches and taking advantage of it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos drop to 1-2 overall while the Gaels stay perfect on the year, improving to 4-0.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s powerful offense was evident straight from the tip. Nicolson knocked down consecutive threes and St. Mary’s jumped out to a quick eight point, which was kept rest of half.</p>\n<p>“It was a frustrating game,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We let them get the shots they wanted and they knocked a lot of shots down. We just didn’t get it done defensively.”</p>\n<p>To start the final period, Santa Barbara’s seniors put the team on their backs, scoring UCSB’s first 11 first points of the half to cut St. Mary’s lead to just one point.</p>\n<p>All three seniors for the Gauchos finished in double-figures. Zornig scored 19 points, four steals and a career-high nine assists while Mason also had a career-high setting night. She finished with a personal best 18 points and seven rebounds, breaking the career-high she already broke earlier this season when she scored 16 against Occidental. Finally, consistent as always, senior guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 17 points.</p>\n<p>“We know the dynamic of the team and we know we have to step it up to another level,” Mason said. “I’m glad Mel got in her rhythm and started knocking down some stuff. We know we have to be on our game because everyone’s following our lead.”</p>\n<p>But St. Mary’s offense was relentless. An 8-0 run a little over halfway through the half gave the Gaels an 11 point cushion, which would be enough to keep the Gauchos at bay the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will continue its road trip Saturday at Santa Clara.
