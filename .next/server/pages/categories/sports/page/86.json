Santa Barbara’s first goal of the match came at the 1:52 mark of the second period by redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader. Cal quickly responded to the score, giving the Bears a three-point advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense was able to limit the Bears’ scoring the first five minutes of the third period, but Cal was able to get two goals in before the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite senior center Lauren Martin, senior attacker Bryn Hudson, and sophomore utility Camila Schafer scoring one each, the match resulted in an 8-4 victory for Cal.</p>\n<p>The loss to Cal led the Gauchos to face Pacific in the second game of the day.</p>\n<p>This time UCSB attacked first and found the back of the net twice by the 5:16 mark. The Tigers retaliated with two goals of their own tying up the game, but thanks to junior utility Taylor Shore it was not for long. The junior gave the Gauchos the lead with her shot at the 0:27 mark of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>In the second period the Tigers came back and grabbed the lead after a two-goal streak, but once again the scoreboard was tied up when freshman defender Kristen Denney scored one more.</p>\n<p>After a back and forth battle for the lead in the third quarter, the game remained tied up 6-6 going into the last period of the game. It was Pacific that managed to get the winning goal at the 1:42 mark earning the Tigers the win.</p>\n<p>Junior attacker Brenna Thomas had two goals against Pacific, while senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had 14 saves adding up to a total of 21 for the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos turned it around the second day sweeping up the competition. In the first game of the day, UCSB collected its first win of the weekend against San Diego State in an overtime battle. It was the second time that the teams had met, once in the Michigan Invitational in which Santa Barbara also came out on top in a 9-8 victory.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs opened up the board with a goal at the two-minute mark, to which UCSB responded with two consecutive goals courtesy of Thomas giving them a one-point deficit lead going into the half.</p>\n<p>The momentum was carried on to the third quarter where the Gauchos scored another two goals for a 4-0 run.</p>\n<p>With the score at 4-1, the Aztecs turned on the jets and put away three goals unanswered. After an ejection drawn by Schrader, junior defender Sophie Trabucco took advantage of the power play and put away the equalizer.</p>\n<p>The first period of overtime went scoreless, then with 1:22 left of the second Trabucco finds the back of the net once again. However, the Aztecs scored thirty seconds later to what seemed would take the game into a sudden death match.</p>\n<p>Just when the cards seemed to have been dealt, Martin came in clutch for the Gauchos drawing an ejection. The senior center did not let the opportunity go to waste, capitalizing on it and giving Santa Barbara the close win 7-6.</p>\n<p>Enhancing Santa Barbara’s momentous win over the Aztecs was its victory against Loyola Marymount to end the day which ended in a 15-12 shootout.</p>\n<p>Martin and Shore both scored five goals each, followed by Schrader with four of her own, and Hudson with one to claim the victory.</p>\n<p>Wasting no time, the Gauchos dominated the first quarter going on a four-goal streak. They maintained the lead throughout the rest of the first half to go into half time leading 7-5.</p>\n<p>Despite an attempted comeback from LMU in the fourth quarter with five goals, the Gauchos had locked in their victory and gathered their second win of the tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face La Verne next at the Axelrod Pool on Saturday, March 5.

The Gauchos managed to get back to their winning ways thanks to a huge performance from redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson, who registered a season-high 18 kills, half of which came in the second set.</p>\n<p>The USC match didn’t go as well for redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh however, as he twisted his ankle coming down from a block halfway through the second set, sidelining him for the rest of the tie. He also missed the team’s match versus Cal Baptist, but McLaughlin is hopeful he’ll be ready for the two upcoming meetings with UCLA.</p>\n<p>Apart from the injury to one of its star players, Santa Barbara couldn’t have asked for much better of a night, easing its way to a straight set victory by scores of 25-19, 25-19, and 25-21.</p>\n<p>“I think we looked great,” redshirt senior Austin Kingi said. “Jonah was putting up some great balls for us, Delson is swinging high and hard, and our middles are connecting perfectly.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it was Kingi who led the Gauchos in kills Friday night against Cal Baptist with 12, helping his team to their second sweep of the week (25-20, 25-16, 25-20). The outside hitter has been one of UCSB’s top performers on both offense and defense, averaging 2.39 kills and 1.33 digs per set.</p>\n<p>“My hits have been feeling better and I’ve been feeling healthy overall,” Kingi said. “I’m getting my swing back after six months out.”</p>\n<p>The story of the match, however, was true freshman Corey Chavers, who put on the best performance of his debut season while filling in for the injured Marsh. The first-year player tallied 10 kills, his highest total since the season opener, adding on a season-high six digs.</p>\n<p>“It’s nothing new,” Kingi said. “We all know Corey’s a big offensive player, and when Marsh is down, it’s great to have another weapon on the floor.”</p>\n<p>The standout youngster was one part of a solid team match for the Gauchos, who eased past Cal Baptist. Senior setter Jonah Seif did his usual job, racking up 35 assists, including a couple jaw dropping passes that reminded the home crowd why he was named to the All-American second team last year.</p>\n<p>After dispatching USC and CBU, two of the bottom three teams in the MPSF standings, UCSB will prepare to face its toughest string of matches of the season. Seven of its final ten games come against teams ranked in the top ten of the AVCA Division I-II Coaches Poll.</p>\n<p>“The true test will be when we hit the road again Wednesday to play at UCLA, and it’s another chance for us to see if we are ready to compete with a top five team,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos are two matches against the Bruins, the first at UCLA on Wednesday at 7 p.m., the second at Rob Gym on Friday at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68674\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68674\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68674/","id":5031,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5030,5029,5028],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Cruise Past UCI 66-37, Come Up Short in 66-60 Loss to Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_7-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team remains in the middle of the pack of the Big West Conference Standings after splitting its pair of games against UCI on Thursday and Cal Poly on Saturday.

Despite recording a season-high 53.8 three-point percentage, UCSB nearly matched its season-high total of 27 turnovers it set in its first meeting against the Mustangs with 24 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara still managed to register a 42. 9 field goal percentage, narrowly edged by the Mustangs’ 44.4 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>An early 5-2 lead in the game’s beginning was the only time UCSB led in Saturday’s game. The small margin would not last as the Mustangs’ 60 percent shooting percentage along with a 9-1 run helped it to take an 18-15 lead to end the first quarter.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly was most productive in the second quarter, outscoring UCSB 19-9 to enter halftime with a double-figure lead 37-24. At the helm of the Mustangs’ scoring attack in the first half was sophomore guard Dynn Leaupepe, scoring 14 of her game-high 20 points in the first two quarters. She closed out the first half with back-to-back three-pointers as she finished with 10 points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, providing UCSB with points was guards senior Jasmine Ware and junior Onome Jemerigbe. The two combined for 16 of the Gauchos’ 24 first half points. Ware led UCSB in scoring with 14 points, while Jemerigbe concluded Saturday with 11 points and a game-high five assists. Sophomore forward Chaya Durr finished with 10 points and a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs gained their largest lead of 14-points at the 9:25 mark of the third quarter with a 40-26 lead.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which UCSB brought its deficit within single-figures. A layup by sophomore forward Taylor Farris trimmed Cal Poly’s lead to an eight-point margin of 55-47. The basket sparked UCSB’s 7-0 run, bringing the Gauchos within three, 52-55.</p>\n<p>Following a layup by Cal Poly junior forward Hannah Gilbert, Farris answered with a three-pointer to bring UCSB within its closest deficit of two points at 55-57.</p>\n<p>As the momentum gradually shifted in favor of the Gauchos, a dagger from beyond the arc by senior guard Beth Balbierz handed Cal Poly a 60-55 lead with 36 seconds remaining in the game. She was the Mustangs’ second leading scorer with 14 points on 2-3 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UCSB fouled the Mustangs in the game’s remaining seconds in hope of completing its combeack, but Cal Poly shot a perfect 6-6 from the free-throw line in the final quarter to secure its 66-60 victory.</p>\n<p>While a total of four different Gauchos scored double-figures in points, UCSB’s starting lineup struggled in its matchup versus UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 42.4 percent from the field, Ware was the Gauchos only double-figure scorer with a game-high 17 points off the bench.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara didn’t have any illustrious individual performances Thursday night, its 53 rebounds was the most it recorded in a conference game this season. UCSB outrebounded UCI 53-30, helping result in the Gauchos outscoring the Anteaters 26-8 in the paint and 15-4 on second chance points.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Thursday’s victory was one of UCSB’s best defensive performances of the season as it held UC Irvine to 31.0 shooting and 14.3 three-point percentages. The Gauchos held UCI to just four points twice in the second and fourth quarters.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCSB prevented all UCI players from scoring within double-figures as the Anteaters leading scorer was freshman guard Andee Ritter.</p>\n<p>Farris tied her career-high of 13 rebounds in Thursday’s 66-37 win over UCI.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final game of the season this Thursday, Feb. 3 at Hawaii at 9 p.m. HST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/","id":350,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[349,348,347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Overcomes No. 64 Hawaii 4-2, Falls to No. 35 Oregon 5-2","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After earning its fourth consecutive victory with a 4-2 win over No. 64 Hawaii, the UCSB women's tennis team had its streak ended with a 5-2 loss to No. 35 Oregon over the weekend.

Santa Barbara managed to pull off two wins before losing another match, resulting in its 5­2 defeat.</p>\n<p>UCSB still has yet to find consistency as a cohesive unit, but as a new team it will continue to progress and gain the chemistry needed to make a good run in the postseason.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road again, facing Santa Clara, San Jose State, and St. Mary’s starting this Friday, March 4 through March 6.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68691\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68691\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/","id":1048,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1047,1046,1045],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head Out to San Diego for Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos will hope to bounce back and have a solid tournament at the inaugural Tony Gwynn Classic.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68508\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68508\" data-attachment-id=\"68508\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/gauchos-head-out-to-san-diego-for-tournament/mbaseball_vsusf-20160220-dustinharris-5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-5-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68508\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBaseball_vsUSF-20160220-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"After roundig third base, Billy Fredrick sprints home to score a run.

Other teams the Gauchos could face is San Diego State who has struggled mustering only a 1-4 record and Bryant University who is currently perfect at 4-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This will be a good test for us, a solid tournament to show our stuff.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, fans will be able to witness how UCSB will bounce back after a tough loss on Tuesday. The game against St. Mary’s could have been about fatigue considering it was the Gauchos fifth game in five days.</p>\n<p>“Five games in five days was tough for our team.” Checketts said “This three game series will go much better.”</p>\n<p>Now coming into the weekend with a solid three-day rest, Santa Barbara should be able to show the same intensity it showed in its first series of the season. It will also be interesting to see if the young team will be able to overcome early adversity.</p>\n<p>“We are going to respond the right way. That loss was not the end of the world.” Redshirt junior Andrew Calica said. “This team is young and motivated, we will be ready.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are led by redshirt sophomore J.J Muno who leads the team in hits with eight and RBI with six. The young second baseman has been the most consistent Gaucho having at least one hit in every game this season. Calica also comes in hot hitting 7-14 in his last four games.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also found out it can count on redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover. In Tuesday’s outing he hit 3-5 and batted in a runner. He currently leads the team in batting average with a .429 BA.</p>\n<p>Another interesting thing to keep note of this weekend will be the line-up changes made by coach Checketts. In all five games this season only Calica has stayed in the same batting position as the lead-off hitter, the rest have all been moved to see what line-up works best.</p>\n<p>“We still got a lot of moving parts.” Checketts said. “As we get further into the season we will get more answers but for now we just want to see guys play their way into the line-up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is slated to start Shane Bieber against the Wildcats. The junior won his first game of the season after pitching seven solid innings allowing seven hits and two runs while also striking out four. Against UK last year, Bieber pitched eight innings allowing only one run and nine hits.</p>\n<p>“As a group we need to throw more strikes and be more aggressive.” Checketts said. “I’d like to see Bieber, Nelson, Garcia, Davis all do good.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face a Kentucky team that is coming off a 15-run, 20-hit, seven homerun performance in its last outing against Dayton. Early in the year, the Wildcats are sporting the highest slugging percentage (.728) and most home runs (10) to start a season in school history.</p>\n<p>UK is led by junior Javon Shelby. Shelby leads UK and the SEC with a .667 batting average to start to the year, with six of his eight hits going for extra bases, adding six runs, two homers and three RBI.</p>\n<p>Another strong hitter for Kentucky is freshman Tristan Pompey who is second on the team in batting average with a .500 BA. The SEC freshman of the opening week of the season also leads the team in homeruns with three.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be facing right-hander Zach Brown who is currently 0-1 with a 9.82 ERA. The junior had a tough opening day start against Wofford allowing nine hits and three runs in just 3.2 innings of work. His second opponent won’t be any easier as the Gauchos are batting a solid .353 as a team this season.</p>\n<p>If UCSB is able to pull off the win Friday, then it will face the winner of Bryant University and San Diego State. Bryant seems to be one of the most formidable opponents in this tournament as they are the only undefeated team.</p>\n<p>If it wins both games, Santa Barbara will then go into the championship round and play either Arizona, Nebraska, Tulane and/or University of San Diego.</p>\n<p>“This is going to be a good tournament; we can’t underestimate anybody.” Calica said. “We have to come out with the fire we had on opening weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Friday, February 26<sup>th</sup> at 1 p.m. in San Diego, California for the Tony Gwynn Classic against Kentucky at Tony Gwynn Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Junior outfielder Kristen Clark will be sure to come out strong in this weekend’s tournament, as she has a .459 batting average with eight runs scored thus far.</p>\n<p>Alongside her will be freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer, who has already made a name for herself leading the Gauchos in virtually all offensive categories. Hitting at an incredible clip of .467, she has knocked in 10 RBIs and has scored six runs so far in this season. Although only a freshman, Altmeyer has a pretty good feel for her team.</p>\n<p>“If everyone’s on the same page and connecting on the field or in the dugout, then our day rolls pretty well,” Altmeyer said.</p>\n<p>The pitching staff, who as a team is sporting a 5.47 ERA, will need to use the remainder of the week to prepare. Especially starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow, who is carrying a solid ERA of 2.23, as she will have to face South Carolina first with a lineup featuring four players batting at least .400.</p>\n<p>“Obviously when playing a top team you get a little excited to prove yourself, but I prepare myself the same way against any team,” Ludlow said. “Pitching is mostly mental for me, so it’s all about being in the right mind set.”</p>\n<p>When facing the 9-1 Gamecocks, Ludlow will have to pay special attention to their biggest threat: senior outfielder Alaynie Page. Page set five South Carolina single-season records in the last year, including 15 home runs.</p>\n<p>The Gamecocks’ junior pitcher Jessica Elliott will have an intimidating presence on the mound as she carries a stellar 0.98 ERA into the Classic. Gaucho top hitters Clark and Altmeyer will surely be tested when facing Elliott’s efficient pitching.</p>\n<p>Georgia Tech may pose an easier game for the Gauchos as it enters this tournament not having won a single game. Despite the Yellow Jackets’ six-game losing streak, an upset victory could be the startingpoint to a possible turnaround. Although the Gauchos are favored to win, they cannot take any game lightly.</p>\n<p>The Yellow Jackets’ biggest threat to the Gauchos will be junior outfielder Samantha Pierannunzi. She leads Georgia Tech in a majority of the team’s offensive categories, batting .278 with five runs scored this year.</p>\n<p>The Southern Utah Thunderbirds come into the tournament with a 3-9 overall record. They have lost their last three games and are struggling through the early stages of the season. They are led by junior catcher Morgan Leonard, who is hitting .387 on the season with three home runs and 10 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Jordan Theurer also is a key contributor for Southern Utah at the plate, with a .455 batting average and six runs scored. However, the primary problem for the Thunderbirds is their pitching, as they have a team ERA of 8.96.</p>\n<p>The tournament’s opening game will take place this Friday, Feb. 26 at 8:30 a.m. as the Gauchos take on the South Carolina Gamecocks, then face Georgia Tech at 10:30 a.m. The two-game series with both teams will continue on Saturday, Feb. 27 with UCSB taking on South Carolina again at 8:30 a.m. and the Yellow Jackets in the afternoon at 1 p.m. The Gaucho Classic I will conclude Sunday, Feb. 28 with UCSB’s matchup versus Southern Utah set to take place at 11:15 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 25, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Our team is brand new. It takes a bit of time so that everyone can come together at the same time … the season is still very long and our results give us hope for what comes next,” Adler said.</p>\n<p>While future matches await the Gauchos, they are gradually improving as a team having won four of their last five contests.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCSB’s 1-0 start to Big West play is an encouraging sign early in the season.</p>\n<p>“The good thing is that when we lose we are very tough to beat, and we know we have a lot of potential and that we can defeat any team … Everyone in our team is confident about it” Adler said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Hawaii this Friday, Feb. 26 at 3 p.m. PST and Oregon on Saturday, Feb. 27 at 11 a.m. PST. Both games will be played in Honolulu, HI.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 25, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/","id":119,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[118,117,116],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 17 Gauchos Prepare for UCI Invitational this Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's water polo team will attempt to erase its three-match losing streak playing in the UC Irvine Invitational.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended its visit to San Diego with a win over No. 22 Marist College, but were defeated by No. 7 Arizona State, No. 14 Loyola Marymount University and No. 13 UC San Diego.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s subpar 1-3 finish, there were some individual standout performances throughout the team’s two days of competition.</p>\n<p>On opening day of the invitational, the Gauchos were led by redshirt senior center Lauren Martin who put away four goals, including a hat trick against the Red Foxes. The Fresno native shot 3-4 to sustain a .581 shooting percentage this season.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, junior utility Taylor Shore was active in stealing the ball, collecting seven on the day— three of which were against the Sun Devils. Complementing Shore was senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw who had nine saves in total and three steals per game.</p>\n<p>However, it was senior attacker Bryn Hudson who took the second day of the invitational with her outstanding work in the pool, finding the back of the net for a combined seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against the Tritons. She also went on to contribute five assists in the second game of the day against LMU.</p>\n<p>“<u></u>Bryn Hudson is tough as nails,” Coach Kay said. “She [Hudson] plays with the same mental toughness no matter who the opponent.  She will continue to make an impact not only as a playmaker but also as a scorer.”</p>\n<p>Brokaw on her part had 12 saves in the first match to go along with two steals. She tallied six saves and a steal in the second contest, but it was not enough to lead the Gauchos to victory as they dropped both games on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With that behind them, the Gauchos will now focus on what is to come this weekend. There are a total of 16 teams participating, which are divided into four separate groups. Santa Barbara is placed in “Group C” along with tough competitors such as No. 3 Cal, No.6 Hawaii, No.12 Pacific.</p>\n<p>The first matchup for UCSB will be Saturday morning against No. 3 Cal. The Bears are 13-1 overall after their solid performance at the UC Davis Invitational in which they defeated No. 12 Pacific and Brown University. Cal will look to extend its current nine-match winning streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos faced the Bears earlier this season in an intense game that went into overtime. A goal by sophomore driver Carla Carrega in the last seven seconds of the match clinched the Bears’ second chance, forcing the game into its extra period. It was in overtime where Cal finished the game to defeat Santa Barbara by a score of 9-8.</p>\n<p>“We have now played 4 OT games so far this season and I believe if we are resilient these games will teach lessons in big moments come Big West Championship time,” Coach Kay said. “This is what we have been focusing on to prepare for this coming weekend where every game in the tournament will be a fight to the final buzzer.”</p>\n<p>The biggest threat to the Gauchos will once again be Carrega, who is responsible for most of the Golden Bears’ scoring so far this season. The sophomore currently ranks third in the MPSF in scoring, averaging 2.21 goals per game and is second in total goals scored with 31.</p>\n<p>Apart from the sophomore driver, providing the Bears with productive play are Dora Antal and Anna Illes, who will both participate in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, after their outstanding performances with Hungary in the 2016 European Championships last month.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the UCSB vs. Cal rematch will be an exciting match to watch, and also an important one. The result of the match will dictate who the Gauchos will face in its next match on Sunday, Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on the Bears at 10:30 a.m. at Corona del Mar High School this Saturday, Feb. 27.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We’ve got to be as good as we’ve been all year. Be more discipline, [against CSULB] we gave up middle drives, didn’t communicate switches, and turned the ball over too many times.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters tonight game with an overall record of 10-17, 7-6 in the Big West. The Gauchos sit at fifth in the conference standings, narrowly trailing UCD, who is currently in fourth at 8-5. UC Irvine is clinging onto its eighth-place position with its 8-22 and 1-11 conference record. It owns just one less loss than CSUF, who is 1-12 in the Big West. Cal Poly is 13-14 overall and 6-8 in Big West play for sixth-place, attempting to bounce back from its 61-56 loss to Long Beach State last night.</p>\n<p>In store for the Gauchos are two opponents with similar playing styles that revolve around their frontcourts. This week’s games will be UCSB’s second meeting against both teams. Santa Barbara will hope to establish a better defensive effort after allowing field goal percentages above 40 percent against both opponents earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB will attempt to contain the interior presence of UCI’s duo of junior forwards Mokun Fajemisin and Shereen Sutherland.</p>\n<p>Fajemisin’s rebounding and blocking abilities are most challenging when facing the Anteaters. In addition to ranking fifth in the Big West in rebounds per game at 7.6, her average of 2.2 blocks per game leads the conference. Fajemisin will come into tonight’s matchup with a streak of at least two blocks in the past four consecutive games.</p>\n<p>While Sutherland’s averages of 21. 8 minutes and 7.8 points per game aren’t astounding, her versatile skillset of post offense and mid-range shooting can be difficult to defend.</p>\n<p>“[Fajemisin] really bothered us,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. “Sutherland is a really talented kid who just didn’t have much rhythm there. She got some step away [opportunities] and pulled Je Zhe away from the basket. We fouled too much. It will be important for us to pressure defensively, force tough twos, and rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ended its first matchup against UCI with 24 personal fouls, sending the Anteaters to the free-throw line where they went 16-23.</p>\n<p>In just 24 minutes played, Fajemisin led the Anteaters with 16 points on 6-13 shooting from the floor while adding six rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Sutherland will look to improve her three foul performance in which she had one point at the free-throw line in 14 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing a 40. 4 opponent field goal percentage against the Anteaters in the first meeting, UCSB recorded its third-best shooting performance of the season at 54.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe with a career-high 20 points along with a combined 33 points from junior center Je Zhe Newton and freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the Gauchos will look to confine the Anteaters’ offense tonight, which has struggled on the road averaging just 54.1 ppg and a 32.5 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Following UCSB’s final home game, it will begin its two-game road trip at Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>In spite of falling short in the team’s Senior Day celebration last weekend, UCSB will hope to send out its senior group— Jasmine Ware, Dioseline Lopez, and Kendra Morrison— with one last victory over its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>“We beat them at home, that was the first time I ever beat them in all my four years here so that was good,” Ware said. “It would be even better to beat them at home, at their place. We just have to take care of business at home, then worry about the road. From here on out its just one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ pursuit of sweeping the season series against the Mustangs will be intense as they prepare to face one of the best defenses in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly currently leads the conference in opponent field goal percentage, limiting offenses to a 37.2 average percentage.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs’ defense has helped to stifle opponents, their offense has yet to truly discover a consistent source of scoring. However, emerging in the team’s last three game has been senior guard Beth Balbierz. She has averaged 21.0 ppg over the Mustangs’ last three contests and is second on the team in scoring with 12.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of Cal Poly’s offense is junior forward Hannah Gilbert in the paint. She leads the Mustangs with 13.0 ppg, is third in the Big West in rebounds per game with an 8.7 average, and is second in field goal percentage at 53.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tip-off will take place at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos will face Cal Poly this Saturday, Feb. 26 at 2 p.m. in the Robert A. Mott Athletics Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/","id":349,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[348,347,346],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sisterly Ties: From the Court to the Heart","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=801%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Put into perspective is the influence of family, specifically her older sister Afure, in the life of third-year point guard Onome Jemerigbe of the UCSB women's basketball team.

But it’s great having multiple siblings. I’ve always loved the fact that there’s always multiple people to talk to; it’s like having three best friends.”</p>\n<p>Of those three best friends, the relationship with her only sister, Afure, developed into a relatability beyond the ties of lineage, for it also revolved on the basketball court.</p>\n<p>“She’s [Afure] definitely one of the biggest influences I have as a person and for the reasons why I play basketball,” Onome explained. “She started off playing basketball when she was young. Me being the youngest, I always kind of copied my older siblings, so I kind of followed her into it. Her love for the game influenced me to even try out for basketball.”</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, Afure’s love for the game of basketball didn’t develop without the persistence of a valiant effort that was committed to improving everyday. Nonetheless, Onome served as a constant reminder in ensuring Afure displayed her best at all times.</p>\n<p>“I have always had an incredible love for the game. It was that love that made playing basketball so much fun for me,” Afure said. “I truly believe that Onome plays the way that she does, with so much heart and passion because she too has this love for the sport.”</p>\n<p>Afure attended and played basketball for St. Mary’s High School from 2006-2010. She ranked No. 15 on ESPN HoopGurlz 100 list during her senior year and was a 2010 McDonald’s All-American.</p>\n<p>When Afure was a senior at St. Mary’s, Onome was a freshman. While it was one of the few opportunities for the two to play together, Afure made sure to cherish her last year both being around and playing with her sister.</p>\n<p>“When baby sis played with me for a year during her freshman year in high school, my senior year, I loved it,” she said. “I could watch over her. Make sure she was doing her homework especially on the road games. She was the point guard and could see things from a perspective that I couldn’t, and as a wing guard and an experienced athlete, I could see things that she couldn’t. We have always had such a fun, goofy and close sister to sister relationship. I consider her to be my best friend. I want her to always be the best person that she can be, and I knew that it in order for her to be that, that it started with me. It started with me because I am her older sister and she looked up to me. We were always around each other.”</p>\n<p>Yet their time together would end with Afure attending and playing basketball at the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating in 2014, she played one season overseas in Spain for Al-Qazeres women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>It is through these experiences in which Afure has been able to help guide Onome throughout her career. Specifically, helping enhance Onome’s capabilities both on and off the court is most paramount.</p>\n<p>“From playing at Cal and then going to play overseas, I learned the importance of good character. Character is what is deep inside us; it’s who we are on a daily basis, when things go well and when things go wrong,” Afure said. “It’s who we are in the locker room, on the court as well as in the classroom. We have reason to be proud when both reputation and character are a mirror image of each other.”</p>\n<p>As Onome was in her first year at UCSB, Afure was a senior preparing to conclude her collegiate career at Cal. Although the two sisters were members of opposing programs, Afure helped integrate Onome into the duties and responsibilities of being a collegiate student-athlete.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the stuff she [Afure] went through has helped me to become a better player,” Onome said. “I’m not the perfect player, but I’ve definitely grown because of her. She explained what she should have done, all the mistakes she made. It helps me to not make the same mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Currently in her third year at UCSB as the floor general for the Gauchos’ women’s basketball team, Onome has had an immediate impact on the court since her arrival. Thus far, she has started in 79 of 86 career games played, having started all 29 games her sophomore season.</p>\n<p>Her performance through the years has resulted in her being named to the 2013-14 All-Big West Freshman Team, and she was an Honorable Mention All-Big West recipient last season.</p>\n<p>So far this year, Onome has excelled since the start of the Big West Conference schedule, leading the conference in assists per game with a 5.4 average while ranking second in steals per game with 2.1.</p>\n<p>She also set career-highs in scoring with 20 points at UC Davis and 11 assists versus Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>While her individual accolades do not surpass the team’s long-term goals and the role she plays in them, Onome accredits her maturation as a person to her production on the court.</p>\n<p>“Freshman year, I was easily bothered,” she said. “Not to say that I don’t get bothered every once in a while, but I’ve definitely grown in the mental part of basketball. Just being able to control my emotions and make sure I give my all every time despite if I have turnovers or if we weren’t being successful as a team.”</p>\n<p>While Onome continues to impress on the court and owes much appreciation to Afure for inspiring her love of the game in addition to providing advice on life as a collegiate student-athlete, true inspiration for both sisters begins with their mother. An immigrant from Nigeria who persevered and raised four children, Onome acknowledges her mother as the constant reminder to continue to work hard each day.</p>\n<p>“My mother keeps me balanced, keeps my head straight,” Onome said. “She always seems to know what to say to get me back on track.”</p>\n<p>It has been the existence of this family foundation that has contributed to the person Onome is both on and off the court. According to her, the core to this foundation originates with one word: loyalty.</p>\n<p>“They’re the people that are going to be there for you when times are hard and when times are good,” Onome said. “You can always rely on them to support you and be there for you.”</p>\n<p>Afure has epitomized this essence of loyalty all along, and is now just attempting to replicate the same support system that was provided to her.</p>\n<p>“Home is where heart is. Family is the epicenter of all reasons. Family to me is root of my very existence,” she said. “Without family we wouldn’t be the people that we are today.”</p>\n<p>While basketball helped to further establish the relationship between sisters Onome and Afure, it never defined their bond.</p>\n<p>Once the shot clock hits zero and it’s time to hand in your jersey, the temporary reality of basketball is realized, but family is forever.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 25, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/","id":341,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[340,339,338],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 27 UCSB to Take on No. 70 Pacific and Fresno State in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-11-15_10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-11-15_10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After making a huge leap in the national rankings to its current No. 27 standing, the UCSB men's tennis team will host No. 70 Pacific and Fresno State in its home opener.

This is the highest ranking the team has held since 1998.</p>\n<p>“This is a true milestone and recognition of the work that we have put in up to this point,” junior captain Morgan Mays. “This is by no means our final destination but it is a great check point for us heading home to and we hope to improve on it.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Along with Santa Barbara moving up the ranks, the team’s top doubles team of seniors Miles Seemann and Nathan Eshmade has climbed as well. The team now registers at No. 38, and in part to its success, Eshmade was awarded this week’s Big West Athlete of the Week honors. The senior added two singles win on court one as well to help achieve the weekly recognition.</p>\n<p>This weekend the Gauchos will be looking to build on a record set from the past two seasons, as they come in riding a 10-match win streak when playing at home. Santa Barbara went for an undefeated 9-0 at home last season for the first time in program history and hasn’t lost there since 2014.</p>\n<p>In this weekend’s events, the Gauchos outrank both of their opponents but will still be playing a couple of quality teams with near .500 records and have seen the rankings at some point this season. The Tigers of Pacific hold a record of 5-4 and the Bulldogs of Fresno stand at 3-4. What may work against each team is the fact that neither has had success on the road to this point pulling in records of 2-3 and 0-3 when playing away, respectively.</p>\n<p>The competition with Pacific will bring some excitement in the very first match that will be played on Santa Barbara’s main court this Saturday. In the doubles competition, No. 38 Eshmade and Seemann will face off with the No. 40 team in the nation, Pacific’s Sem Verbeek and Jose Chamba. The outcome of this heated dual will surely set the tone for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>“Now that we’re headed home for a while, it is really time to focus in on our season goals,” Mays said. “Where we are now is great, but we need to continue to build if we want to be national competitors.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are set to take on No. 70 Pacific at the Rec Cen Courts this Saturday at 12pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-27-ucsb-to-take-on-no-70-pacific-and-fresno-state-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-27-ucsb-to-take-on-no-70-pacific-and-fresno-state-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-27-ucsb-to-take-on-no-70-pacific-and-fresno-state-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-27-ucsb-to-take-on-no-70-pacific-and-fresno-state-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-27-ucsb-to-take-on-no-70-pacific-and-fresno-state-in-home-opener/","id":1047,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1046,1045,1044],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Climbs to No. 8 in Nat’l rankings, Preps for USC and No. 15 Cal Baptist","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensVolleyball_2-12-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensVolleyball_2-12-16_7-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB looks to defeat USC, No. 15 Cal Baptist, for the second time this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68507\" style=\"width: 805px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68507\" data-attachment-id=\"68507\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/ucsb-climbs-to-no-8-in-natl-rankings-preps-for-usc-and-no-15-cal-baptist/jonah-seif-sets-the-ball-for-his-teammate-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensVolleyball_2-12-16_7-web.jpg?fit=795%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"795,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jonah Seif sets the ball for his teammate.

The Gauchos have enjoyed consistent success all year in Rob Gym, with a 6-1 record at home, their only loss coming in the five-set thriller against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope that redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh performs at the same level as he did the last time his team met with the Lancers and the Trojans, as he recorded 17 and 19 kills against each, respectively.</p>\n<p>Against Stanford, Marsh, along with the rest of the gauchos, struggled on both offense and defense. Santa Barbara only hit .157, while allowing the Cardinal a .526 hitting percentage, the highest it has allowed all year.</p>\n<p>“As far as Stanford goes it was just one of those nights where we couldn’t get much going,” senior setter Jonah Seif said. “They deserve a lot of credit for putting us in bad situations but we don’t see that match as one that is characteristic of who we are.”</p>\n<p>If the numbers are any indicator of how this week’s set of matches will go, the Gauchos’ past encounters with USC and CBU point in their favor. UCSB dominated the stat sheet against the two teams in January registering more kills, digs, and assists than their opponents in both matches.</p>\n<p>With their win over Pepperdine the Gauchos climbed past the Waves in the AVCA Division I-II Coaches poll, checking in at number eight in this week’s edition of the national rankings, its first time ranked higher than the ten spot in just over a month. The players, though, are worried about what’s next on their plate, not where they sit in the polls.</p>\n<p>“We don’t look into national rankings too much, but it’s nice to see some coaches giving us recognition for some of our wins,” Seif said.</p>\n<p>So far this season, UCSB has struggled against the top teams in the conference, and are 0-4 against the BYU, Long Beach, and Stanford, the top three teams in the MPSF standings. The Gauchos have, however, made quick work of the league’s weaker teams, with a near-perfect 7-1 record against sides below them, but the squad isn’t looking past the rest of the pack.</p>\n<p>“We know that both CBU and USC are playing much better than they were the first time around and we’re preparing as though it’s a brand new scenario,” Seif said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against USC on Wednesday at 7pm at Rob Gym, and again with Cal Baptist on Friday, same time and place.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Gauchos came into the contest hot offensively, however, they were only able to muster one run in the first six innings of the game. Instead, it was St. Mary’s who got off to a hot start scoring two runs in the first inning.</p>\n<p>“I think our energy was low early on.” Junior outfielder Andrew Calica said. “We gave away some early at-bats and you just can’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Junior catcher Nate Nolan started the scoring for the Gaels by batting in two runners, sophomore infielder Zach Kirtley and redshirt freshman outfielder Edward Haus, off a single turned into a double by a fielding error.</p>\n<p>The score would remain 2-0 in favor of St. Mary’s until the fifth inning when J.J. Muno continued his hot start to the season by hitting an RBI single bringing in fellow teammate, freshman outfielder, Michael McAdoo.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara then took the a 4-2 lead in the seventh inning with a solid three-run inning highlighted by sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier’s RBI double, redshirt sophomore catcher Grover Dempsey’s RBI single and sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>After the seventh inning, it looked as though the young UCSB baseball team had regained momentum and was going to maintain its perfect start, however, the Gaels had other plans.</p>\n<p>“We definitely had some momentum after that seventh [inning],” Calica said. “and then to see it get away from us hurts.”</p>\n<p>The eighth inning was a rough one for pitcher Trevor Bettencourt. The redshirt junior was credited with his first loss of the season after allowing all five runs scored by the Gaels that inning.</p>\n<p>“We had good guys in at the right time.” Checketts said. “Sometimes you just don’t execute and its just not your day.”</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s began the inning with the top of its line-up going off as the first five batters got on base. Junior catcher Nate Nolan, sophomore outfielder Joey Fiske, freshman infielder Connor Thane and Haus were all credited with an RBI. The Gauchos could not overcome the 7-4 deficit which led to their eventual loss.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos did lose the game, more credit has to be given to the Gaels for taking the game. They got great performances from Nolan who went 3 for 5 with a double and three RBI and Haus who went 3 for 4 with a double, stolen base and an RBI.</p>\n<p>Although they suffered a tough loss, the Gauchos still have things they should be proud of. The team showed resiliency coming back from a sluggish start and a lot of their young players still proved to have solid outings. Grover went 3 for 5 with an RBI, Muno had another extra base hit and they even got good pitching early on.</p>\n<p>“We bounced back after a tough first couple of innings and we saw some great things, we just have to finish next time.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Sophomore left-hander Kyle Nelson pitched a great game in the three innings he was in allowing no hits, no runs and at one point had five consecutive strikeouts. However, he played so much in the series against USF that the Gauchos could not afford to pitch him longer.</p>\n<p>“Kyle threw a bunch on the weekend,” Checketts said. “that’s as far as he could’ve gone.”</p>\n<p>All in all, Santa Barbara was never expected to win every game this season. No team is expected to go perfect, however, it will be interesting to see how this young team can respond to its first adversity.</p>\n<p>“I think we are a young team with a lot of fire.” Calica said. “We will come back with some new fire and energy this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game will be Friday, February 26<sup>th</sup> at 1 p.m. in San Diego, California for the Tony Gwynn Classic against Kentucky at Tony Gwynn Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Gauchos saw some great offensive fireworks this past weekend scoring 34 runs, 48 hits, four homers and a solid .353 batting average in their series against the Dons.</p>\n<p>“As a team I thought we saw the ball really well.” Plantier said. “We were aggressive and it was nice to see we could swing it well more than people think.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s hitting this year is led by redshirt sophomore J.J Muno who leads the team in hits with seven and is tied for first in homeruns with one. The second baseman also leads the team and is tied for third in the Big West conference in RBI’s with five.</p>\n<p>“In general he [Muno] is like our energizer bunny.” Checketts said. “He is one of the most vocal guys on the team and he is a strong leader.”</p>\n<p>Another strong hitter for the Gauchos is redshirt junior Andrew Calica. The center fielder is second on the team in on-base percentage with .579 and fourth in batting average with .429. Calica also leads the team and is tied for first in the Big West conference in stolen bases with two.</p>\n<p>“I love being the lead-off hitter for our team.” Calica said. “I’m glad these guys trust me and I just want to set the momentum off right every time.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also saw a solid pitching performances from redshirt sophomore left-hander Joe Record. Record only allowed three hits and one run in seven innings pitched in his first start of the season. He is third on the team in strikeouts with five and leads the team in ERA with a solid 1.29.</p>\n<p>“We got a little bit of work to do on the mound but we saw some good things that we can build off of.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be facing a very good team today that is capable of hitting the ball. Sophomore outfielder Joey Fiske leads St. Mary’s in both batting average with .429 and hits with 6. Helping out the Fiske is another fellow sophomore Zach Kirtley. The infielder leads the team in RBI’s with five and slugging percentage with a .667.</p>\n<p>The Gaels also have a solid pitching staff led by junior left-handed pitcher Johnny York who pitched eight innings on Saturday without allowing a single run and only four hits. He also leads the team in strikeouts with seven.</p>\n<p>“We just have to take each game one at a time.” Calica said. “We will be ready for St. Mary’s just like we will be ready for every team we face this season.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shocked a lot of people with their outstanding play this last weekend. Only returning two starters, UCSB has a bunch of new faces, however, these new faces did great to start and now fans are excited to see if they can keep playing well.</p>\n<p>“I think we have some talent a lot of people don’t know about.” Plantier said. “It’s a coming out party for us and we just want to prove people wrong.”</p>\n<p>UCSB looks to extend its winning streak to five Tuesday, February 22 at 2 p.m. against St. Mary’s at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In the fifth inning a sac fly by sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier and a big two-RBI single by redshirt sophomore outfielder Josh Adams gave them a solid 5-1 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>The game was sealed in the seventh inning when Adams hit a big two-run homer to give his team a 7-1 lead. UCSB gave up two runs in the ninth inning, however, it still hung on and won the game 7-3. Redshirt sophomore Joe Record had a great outing on Sunday on allowing three hits and one run with five strikeouts in seven innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Our guys did a good job.” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We did a great job on the mound, Joe [record] had a solid game.”</p>\n<p>Before Santa Barbara achieved the sweep, it first had to play a doubleheader, something that is tough for any team. However, the Gauchos had a fast start in the late game that made it a bit easier for them.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out firing offensively scoring three runs in the first inning. After two Dons runs in the second inning, the Gauchos responded by scoring two runs of their own, including a great homerun by Calica, and maintaining a three run lead at 5-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s most effective inning came in the bottom of the fourth when it scored six runs and took a solid 11-2 lead. It eventually won the game 13-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offensive prowess was highlighted by all nine hitters recording at least one hit and the team having 19 hits as a whole. Calica’s 3-5 day, which included the aforementioned homerun, and sophomore Clay Fisher four singles were notable performances in UCSB’s great offensive day.</p>\n<p>In the earlier game, Santa Barbara had an early scare when they found themselves down 5-1 heading in the bottom of the sixth inning. The Dons offense was led by junior outfielder Harrison Bruce who went 2-4 with 3 RBI and junior Dan James who hit the first homerun of the season for the Dons in the second inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos comeback effort began in the sixth inning when Plantier started the three-run rally with a single. Four of the next six UCSB batters got hits which led to the three runs that cut the Dons lead to just one.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara completed its comeback in the eighth inning when junior outfielder Devon Gradford hit a sac fly that put two runners in scoring position. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark batted the two runners and give his team a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>The Dons tried to put together an effort in the final inning, however, the offense dried out as sophomore Kyle Nelson pitched a 1-2-3 inning to seal the victory for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Before UCSB played a brutal doubleheader, in its season opener redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno had the game of his life to lead his team that day. The second baseman had a solid hitting day going 3-5 with 4 RBI and came just a single shy of hitting the cycle.</p>\n<p>“I was floating out there for a while.” Muno said. “I had no idea what was going on it was amazing.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos season started hot with three scores in the first inning which began with Muno’s double. Plantier batted in his second baseman with a single and redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover hit in two more runners later in the inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB allowed one run at the top of the second but Muno hit a two-RBI triple that gave his team a 5-1 lead. The sophomore’s homerun in the fourth inning gave the Gauchos a commanding 7-1 lead.</p>\n<p>After taking a 7-1 lead, Santa Barbara gave up one run but also added one to win the game 8-2 and start the season off the right way, with a win.</p>\n<p>“We were pretty solid defensively.” Checketts said. “We did a lot of good things and got a good lead early.”</p>\n<p>Right-handed pitcher Shane Beiber had a solid outing going seven innings deep and only allowing two runs. The junior also had four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“I thought our guys on the mound did a great job.” Checketts said. “Beiber was in character and threw some solid strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos perfect start to the season is a great sign of things to come. The young team seemed poise to battle and showed fans new players that seem as though they will contribute a lot to this team.</p>\n<p>“There was so much offensive production,” Checketts said. “I was happy with performances from guys like Clark, Muno. Clark in particular hits in the nine-hole and when your ninth batter bats .450 that’s a good sign.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday at 2 p.m. against St. Mary’s at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
