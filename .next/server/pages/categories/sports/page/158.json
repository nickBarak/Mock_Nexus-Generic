More importantly, the team moves one spot ahead in the standings to 11th overall. Meanwhile, the Trojans have now lost three straight and drop to 3-8 both overall and in MPSF play.</p>\n<p>Unlike in its previous three matches, UCSB began the first set of the game red hot, jumping out to a 9-3 advantage against the Trojans. Fueled by senior middle blocker Dylan Davis’ three kills and four blocks in the set, the Gauchos increased their lead further and won the first set convincingly, 25-16.</p>\n<p>“We really stuck to our scouting reports for SC,” Davis said. “We really limited our errors and forced SC to play our game.”</p>\n<p>USC rebounded in the second game, but the Gauchos were just as relentless in their attack. A nail-biting game from start to finish, each side traded points until UCSB gave itself breathing room for a slight 18-14 lead. With each team failing to distance themselves, it eventually took the Gauchos seven match point serves to gut out a gritty 30-28 win.</p>\n<p>USCB held the decisive edge on defense, tallying seven blocks compared to the Trojans’ one, giving the Gauchos enough of an advantage to pull through.</p>\n<p>“It was a battle because we were back and forth constantly,” Evans said. “What was the big turnaround for us is that we got a lot of blocks tonight. Our passing and defense is what really helped us win that match.”</p>\n<p>After dropping the third set 25-21, UCSB seemed to be still reeling from the loss and began the fourth set down 6-1. A resilient performance from the Gauchos narrowed the gap and ultimately allowed them to take the set for a 25-21 victory and their first conference win since Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>“We started out not the way we wanted to,” Evans said. “We were a little timid, but we came back and we got a couple aces and that was really big for us.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has another critical game approaching against No. 7 UCLA Wednesday, a team that has defeated the Gauchos twice in the season already.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Mark Brocher/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/","id":5333,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5332,5331,5330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Sacramento State in BracketBusters","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Losers of two straight and seven of the last eight games, the UCSB men’s basketball team could not have asked for a nonconference game at a better time.

The Hornets, meanwhile, are also losers of two straight games entering Saturday’s contest at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to use this as an opportunity as a prep game just for the next games coming up, and obviously we’re going to try to get the win too,” freshman forward Taran Brown said. “We all need to get together at a time like this, get our heads right and just keep grinding through it.”</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to win, they will have to improve upon its recent shooting performances as the Gauchos shot under 26 percent from the field against Riverside. Big Al led UCSB with 15 points and 12 rebounds but was only 4-18 from the field.</p>\n<p>“It all comes down to poor shooting,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “During the game, you shoot the ball at [26] percent, you’re going to have a hard time beating anybody. If you throw on top of that turning the ball over … it still makes it difficult when you do those things.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward John Dickson leads Sac. State with 13.3 points per game and is second on the team with 5.8 rebounds per game. A key to the game will be how the depleted Gauchos slow down Dickson in the paint.</p>\n<p>With only eight players available to play during their last two games, the Gauchos have struggled with injuries all season. There is an outside chance that junior guard Kyle Boswell, the team’s best shooter, could return by Saturday from a shoulder injury, but the odds are still unlikely.</p>\n<p>“Is our confidence shaken at this time? Sure, we’re not playing very well,” Coach Williams said. “I think it’s a residue of how beat up we’ve been and that we’ve really been holding it together with different pieces every game and different guys. It’s a house of cards and it can tumble, and unfortunately [Wednesday] night, offensively, it just tumbled.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s BracketBusters game against Sacramento State is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/","id":640,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[639,638,637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Play Dons in Home Opener Today","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team is 2-1 after one weekend of baseball and will ride its two game winning streak into this weekend’s home opening series against the University of San Francisco.

The Gauchos get their first taste of home field action this year after the original home opener Tuesday against UCLA was rescheduled due to weather.</p>\n<p>The Dons are 1-3 so far this season after defeating San Francisco State University on Wednesday for their first win of the season. USF won the contest 10-5 thanks in large part to senior outfielder Mitchell Rowan and junior designated hitter Zachary Turner who each drove in three runs. The Dons rallied for 17 hits to jump start their offense after they had previously lost their first three games to Cal Poly in a weekend sweep. Turner has started the season hot as he has collected hits in each of his first four games and has recorded five RBI over his last two.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco offense will come up against a slightly different weekend pitching staff than the Gauchos ran out last weekend. Sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone’s performance last weekend has earned him today’s start in the first home game of the year for UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We are changing our rotation a little bit this weekend,” Checketts said. “We are going with Pettibone on Friday, [Justin] Jacome and [Kenny] Chapman on Saturday and [to be announced] on Sunday.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense will look to stay hot this weekend and carry over the momentum from last weekend’s showing where they put up eight and 11 runs in consecutive games.</p>\n<p>“It is going to be important for us to build off of what we did last weekend; we had a great bounce back last weekend after losing the first game and coming back strong the next two games,” senior third baseman Marc Venning said. “[San Francisco] is going to want to beat us.

Sophomore pitcher Andrew Vasquez and senior Jared Wilson threw 88 and 98 pitches respectively in that game.</p>\n<p>“I think we are extremely solid defensively. We have guys at every single position that are able to make not only the normal plays but the extraordinary plays.” Venning said. “It was nothing to do with talent or ability, I just think it had to do with the jitters and I think we got that out of our system the first night.”</p>\n<p>Game one of the four game weekend series will begin today at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday the teams will play a double-header with game one slated for an 11 a.m. start and a 3 p.m. start for game two.

Shooting 49.3 percent from the field, she also ranks fifth in field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>The last time these teams met up in Hawaii, the Gauchos came away with a 51-50 win that handed the Rainbow Wahine their first home conference loss. UCSB was clutch down the stretch with junior guard Nicole Nesbit making a lay-up with 12.5 seconds remaining to give Santa Barbara a one-point lead. On the other end, the Gauchos came up with the defensive stop and earned its first come from behind victory of the season.</p>\n<p>“That game we willed ourselves to a win,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We made big stops and we had players that stepped up and were willing to take the big shots.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff against Hawaii is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 21st 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier/ Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/","id":639,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[638,637,636],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Pepperdine in Straight Sets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/M_Vball_MarkBrocher.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/M_Vball_MarkBrocher.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite playing only one hour away from Santa Barbara, the road continues to give the UCSB men’s volleyball team trouble as the Gauchos lost last night against No. 4 Pepperdine three sets to none.

Meanwhile, the Waves improve to 8-4 overall and in league, and remain unbeaten at home.</p>\n<p>Although only having three league wins on the season and sitting in last place, UCSB still maintains a realistic shot at reaching the postseason midway through the season, with many teams in the conference separated by a few games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB got off to rocky start in the first set of the match. After trading points, the Waves broke through and went on a five-point run to extend their lead to 16-11 before the Gauchos finally were able to answer with a point of their own. With the game quickly getting out of hand, Pepperdine continued its pressure and at one point led by seven points before ultimately winning 25-17.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine won the set decisively thanks in large part to its execution on offense and defense, totaling more kills (13 to 8) and blocks (8 to 2) than UCSB for the set.</p>\n<p>The second game of the match proved to be more competitive as UCSB was able to keep pace with the Waves for the entire set. Playing point for point, Santa Barbara eventually pulled ahead with a five-point run of its own and led 12-7. However, the lead was short lived after Pepperdine was able to narrow the gap and pulled even at 20 all.</p>\n<p>Inconsistent in close games since the beginning of the season, UCSB again could not close out the set, allowing Pepperdine to take control and score five of the next seven points to win the game 25-22.</p>\n<p>Just as in the second set, Santa Barbara played well in the early part of the third game, showing signs of recovering from the second set loss. With the game even at 14, sophomore middle blocker Parker Kalmbach and senior opposite Maurice Torres scored the next four Pepperdine points to give the Waves enough momentum to go on another four-point run later in the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB failed to find an answer for Torres, who had eight kills in the set, leading Pepperdine to a 25-20 win and a sweep. It was the Gauchos second straight loss by way of sweep and fourth overall this year.</p>\n<p>The top performer for the Gauchos was senior middle blocker Dylan Davis, who accumulated seven kills on the night to go along with four blocks. Sophomore outside hitter Kevin Donohue continued his impressive play, leading UCSB with a team-high nine kills.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have only one day to rest and prepare itself for a match against No. 9 USC on Thursday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 20th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Mark Brocher/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-pepperdine-in-straight-sets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-pepperdine-in-straight-sets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-pepperdine-in-straight-sets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-pepperdine-in-straight-sets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-pepperdine-in-straight-sets/","id":5329,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5328,5327,5326],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lakers at a Crossroads Without Owner Jerry Buss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Los Angeles Lakers have lost a legend.

Along with the Yankees’ former owner George Steinbrenner, Buss always did what it took to make his team the best. He never shied away from the biggest personalities or from opening up the checkbook to sign players and coaches like Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, James Worthy, Pat Riley, Phil Jackson, Shaquille O’Neil, Steve Nash, Dwight Howard and, of course, Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>But now all of that is in the past. His death, along with the fact that the Lakers’ supposed “super team” is a meager 25-29 and the Clippers are turning into a powerhouse, confirm that the Lakers franchise is at a major turning point. Without the wise and omniscient leadership of Dr. Buss, where does one of the most beloved and recognizable franchises in the world go from here?</p>\n<p>First of all, if the Lakers miraculously make the playoffs, the consensus is that they don’t have the tools or chemistry to consistently beat any one of the top teams in the Western Conference. They simply do not put together a consistent winning formula night in and night out.</p>\n<p>Howard’s health and attitude seem to be in a constant state of uncertainty. Nash and Coach D’Antoni are torn between running a quick-paced offense and running a slower half-court offense. Kobe is still playing well, but is beginning to hint at retirement.</p>\n<p>Above all else, this Lakers team no longer expects to win. When the Lakers are at their best, they expect to win every single game. Now the first question is how badly did they lose tonight?</p>\n<p>Looking beyond this year, Bryant has one year left on his contract worth $30.4 million, Howard becomes a free agent after this season, Gasol has one year left on his contract worth $19.2 million, Metta World Peace has a player option for next year worth $7.7 million and Nash has two years remaining worth a combined $20 million.</p>\n<p>All of that means that after next season, Nash will be the only current player under contract assuming Howard, Gasol and Bryant all leave. So, what do the Lakers need to do? What they always do, use the salary cap space to spend the money and use the L.A. lifestyle to bring championship players to their team.</p>\n<p>One thing that would go a long way in helping the Lakers achieve that would be to retain the services of current General Manager Mitch Kupchak, who was Dr. Buss’ right-hand man. Kupchak is widely respected around the league and will help make the ownership transition from Dr. Buss to his children much smoother with his experience at handling the Lakers.</p>\n<h6><em> A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 20th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/","id":679,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[678,677,676],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"More Than Just a Small-Town Boy","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Some of the biggest stars have humble, small-town roots.

I enjoy myself out here a lot more, I would say.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brown hails from Gillette, Wyoming, the fourth-largest city in the state with a population of roughly 30,000. Needless to say, growing up in such a small and isolated place certainly helped to shape Brown into the man and player he is today.</p>\n<p>“Everyone kind of knows everyone and that’s kind of how it is in Wyoming,” Brown said. “If you’re a pretty well-known athlete, you kind of just know everyone because it is a small place. There’s not a lot of violence there, so it’s a great place to grow up. I really love Wyoming, especially my hometown.”</p>\n<p>Making it as a basketball player was not always the only dream for Brown. He played football and participated in several track events including hurdles, high jump, long jump and the triple jump up until his sophomore year in high school. Had he continued playing either sport, Brown has no doubt he could have played either at the college level.</p>\n<p>“I quit just to focus on basketball,” Brown said. “I was actually pretty good in both of those and went to state in both of those. It would have been fun to be a college wide receiver, but I think my passion is definitely basketball.”</p>\n<p>While his 6’8” frame would have certainly proven deadly as a wide receiver, where Brown truly excels is in his athletic ability. His ability to shoot and run the floor like a guard with the build of a forward helped him to establish a future beyond playing high school ball at Campbell County High School.</p>\n<p>“It was tough, especially since the population is not too high in Wyoming. There is under a million people, so it’s hard to get recognized for basketball,” Brown said. “We didn’t have [Amateur Athletic Union], so my traveling coaches when I grew up, we all went to tournaments all over just to get my name out there.”</p>\n<p>During high school, Brown stood out on a national stage despite playing in the least populated state in the country. Taran was named a McDonald’s All-American as well as the Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Wyoming. He was also a two-time All-State selection and led Campbell County to a state title during his senior year.</p>\n<p>“[Assistant] Coach [Matt] Stock (a Wyoming native) really deserves credit on [bringing Taran to UCSB] because of the Wyoming connection,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He had heard a ton about him and been in touch with him and had been mailing him stuff. I watched him play in Vegas, and from that, that’s when we really started recruiting him. Once he got out here and saw Santa Barbara and all that compared to where he grew up, it was a really nice opportunity for him.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the charm of Santa Barbara lured Brown, a sociology major, away from competing schools such as Colorado State and Wyoming. Last season, Brown, along with Coach Williams, decided to redshirt in order to save a year of eligibility. That decision allowed him to focus on transitioning from Wyoming life to the faster California lifestyle he wasn’t used to.</p>\n<p>“To see his transition was funny. When he first got here he didn’t know a lot of things, didn’t know a lot of California terms, didn’t know a lot of places to go eat and never heard of a lot of things,” sophomore guard T.J. Taylor said. “It was very fun to see him transition from a little Wyoming kid to now, almost a superstar.”</p>\n<p>This season, Brown has shown just how dangerous of a player he can be. With six games left in the regular season, he has already broken the school’s single-season record for three-pointers made in a season by a freshman with 52. That number ranks seventh in the entire Big West Conference. His 11.7 points per game rank third this season for UCSB and are first amongst freshmen in the conference.</p>\n<p>Brown has also shown to be versatile aside from scoring, ranking second on the team in rebounds (5.7), steals (0.9) and blocks (1.0), third in assists (2.2) and first in minutes per game (31.1). He has eclipsed the 20-point mark three times this season and registered a career-high 22 points in only his second game as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“His potential is to the sky, it’s just on him to have the mentality to come into the gym everyday, really working to get better and really believing in himself as well,” Taylor said. “I think he will, with the push from the coaches and his teammates. He can be a superstar. I’m excited to see him grow and become a better player.”</p>\n<p>With his future looking bright at UCSB, Brown’s dreams of playing basketball as a profession are slowly taking shape. Who would have thought that a small-town kid from snowy northeastern Wyoming would one day become the big man on campus at sunny Santa Barbara?</p>\n<p>“Ever since I was five years old, I just started with a ball and had travel leagues from first grade all the way until now. It’s always been my thing and I just really love to play,” Brown said. “When I’m on the court, it just feels like I’m in the right place. I’m going to bring basketball as far as I can. I know I have a ways to go, but anything can happen, so I’m going to keep pushing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays at UC Riverside tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of February 20th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/","id":638,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[637,636,635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Rival Cal Poly at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/polybbal.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/polybbal.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Most teams prefer to play at home — not the UCSB women’s basketball team.

As a result, the Gauchos drop to 11-13 overall and 7-5 in the Big West, falling into fourth place in the conference standings. Cal Poly, on the other hand, improves to 14-9 overall and 8-4 in league.</p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m going to be creative in trying to get these guys to play free, play the basketball we’re capable of and play the way we play on the road,” Mitchell said. “Maybe I can get the administration to okay us to stay in a hotel around the corner, so that way we feel like we’re on the road.”</p>\n<p>In this Blue-Green Rivalry game, great offense beat solid defense. Santa Barbara, which prides itself at keeping its opponents much below their scoring average, was unable to stop the Mustangs’ potent offense as their 65 points are just shy of their 68.4 point-per-game average.</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently 1-8 when its opponent breaks the 60-point mark. Overall, the Gauchos were outshot by the Mustangs 45.3 percent to 35.1 percent.</p>\n<p>“A stat that always lets me know that we’re going to be in trouble is when we take more field goals than the opponent, especially a team like Poly,” Mitchell said. “That’s their game to get up and down, so we can’t expect to play their style and come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>For the second-straight game, UCSB couldn’t contain 6’5’’ Molly Schlemer. The junior center led all players with 18 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>From the first tip, Cal Poly took control. Tied at two, a three by sophomore guard Ariana Elegado sparked a 16-0 run for the Mustangs. Aided by nine first-half turnovers from UCSB, the lead grew to its largest margin of 17 with just under 10 minutes remaining in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB narrowed the lead to eight with 16 minutes to go, but three consecutive treys by Cal Poly were enough to keep the Gauchos at bay. The 9-0 run was spurred by Elegado and senior guard Kayla Griffin, both of whom finished in double figures with 12 and 15 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>On the game, Cal Poly was 8-17 on threes for an incredible 47.1 percent.</p>\n<p>“We just guarded the No. 1 three-point shooting team in our conference in Pacific, so there really should be no excuse,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos responded, going on a 14-4 run to narrow the lead to seven with 6:07 remaining. The momentum was in UCSB’s favor, but a three by Elegado brought the lead back to 10 and would be too much for Santa Barbara to overcome.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Sweets Underwood paced UCSB offensively, tallying her 10th double-double of the season with 15 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its three-game homestand Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 19th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/","id":680,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[679,678,677],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens 2013 Season With Solid Offense","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team played well as the hosts of the Gaucho Classic this weekend, finishing with a 3-2 record and improving to 8-2 on the season.

After falling behind 5-1 early in their first game of the weekend against the Tigers, a two-run homer by first baseman Lauren Boser in the fourth inning would cut the lead to 5-3. However, Missouri pushed their lead to 11-3 in the fifth inning and ended the game on the run rule.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ second game of the day against San Diego, they were able to hold on to a 5-4 lead to pull off their first home win of the season. Sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom brought in junior outfielder McKenzie Kane for the winning run when she grounded out to third base, and followed it up by striking out the Toreros’ final batter in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>Against Fresno State on Saturday, Wisdom was excellent at pitcher, shutting out the Bulldogs through the first five innings. The most impressive effort in the game, though, was given by senior shortstop Keilani Jennings, who was responsible for all five of the runs scored by the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite two runs from the Bulldogs in the sixth inning, Wisdom was able to finish them off, retiring three straight batters in the seventh. Jennings ended the day 3-3 with five RBI and two home runs, and Wisdom improved to 5-1 on the season at pitcher. Fresno fell to 6-6 on the season with the loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ second effort against Missouri on Sunday. Up 5-0, Missouri would pile on two more runs in the fifth and five in the seventh to knock off the Gauchos 12-1 and improve to 5-0 on the season.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, the Gauchos again found themselves tied with the Toreros in the seventh inning, but an extra inning would be needed to decide this one. Freshman catcher Samantha Stark hit a walk off double to bring Boser in for the winning run, giving the Gauchos a 3-2 victory. San Diego fell to 3-4 on the season with the two losses against UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The games weren’t as clean as they had been for most of the year, but the exciting thing is that we pulled out these close games,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “Just being able to pull out these close games when we’re not playing the cleanest ball, they showed a lot of grit.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays Friday against Oklahoma in the Cathedral City Classic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 19th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50185\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/ucsb-opens-2013-season-with-solid-offense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50185\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/ucsb-opens-2013-season-with-solid-offense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/ucsb-opens-2013-season-with-solid-offense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/ucsb-opens-2013-season-with-solid-offense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/ucsb-opens-2013-season-with-solid-offense/","id":982,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[981,980,979],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prepare For First Home Games of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a dominant weekend at the Mardi Gras Classic which saw the UCSB softball team off to a 5-0 start to the season, the Gauchos will look to continue their hot play when they host the Gaucho Classic...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a dominant weekend at the Mardi Gras Classic which saw the UCSB softball team off to a 5-0 start to the season, the Gauchos will look to continue their hot play when they host the Gaucho Classic this weekend.

With Missouri boasting the talents of two-time All-American and Big 12 Pitcher of the Year Chelsea Thomas, the Gauchos will have to be on their mark offensively if they are going to start the weekend off right. However, their overall togetherness and solid team play has made them a confident unit.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is contributing to the team wins which is really great. We have a strong pitching staff, strong and consistent hitting and strong defense,” Pilpil said. “It’s amazing to look at our team now and know that there is so much room for us to grow as a team as the season goes on.”</p>\n<p>In its next game against San Diego (1-1), UCSB will be looking to erase memories of a 5-1 loss to the Toreros in last year’s Gaucho Classic.</p>\n<p>Against Fresno State (6-1), UCSB will be up against an opponent that has dominated them historically in the all-time series 62-11. However, the Gauchos can look to a 2-1 victory against the Bulldogs last season to give them confidence in this matchup.</p>\n<p>After last weekend’s games gave UCSB its first real look at what it will be capable of this season, the team seems content with the level of play right now on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“The team was very consistent on the offense as well as the defense, from putting up a lot of hits to having solid defense and turning double plays,” Pilpil said. “You could just tell the team dynamic is really coming together and it was definitely exciting to watch.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom is off to a great start this season after throwing two shutouts in two starts while also leading the team with seven RBI and one home run.

Last weekend, UCSB came away with two road wins up north, defeating UC Davis 60-52 before upsetting Pacific 52-47.</p>\n<p>Down 14 three minutes into the second half, the Gauchos used balanced offense, featuring three players in double figures, as well as its typical tenacious defense to hold the Tigers to nearly 25 points below their average and overcome the top team in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We have to keep doing what we’re doing,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “Obviously we’re doing something right, but we’re still humble. We’re not getting too excited and losing our focus.”</p>\n<p>After the pair of victories, Underwood was named the Big West Player of the Week for the fourth time this season. She averaged a double-double in the road wins with 14.5 points and 14 rebounds, including a career-high 16 rebounds against Pacific.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about me; it’s a team thing,” Underwood said. “I think when we have individual awards, it’s a reflection of our team and our coaching staff and the hard work and effort we’ve put in as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB holds an incredible 7-4 record away from home, Santa Barbara will have to find a way to win in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos are only 3-6 at home, but will have the opportunity to put back-to-back home wins together for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s been the million dollar question with this team,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We have to bring a lot of energy because when we go into away gyms, that’s already manifested itself. Of course, [the energy is] going against us and for some reason, we like that. But, I think it’s going to be fun playing in our house and it’s a big rivalry game, so it’ll be a fun Saturday.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s last game against Cal Poly wasn’t fun for the Gauchos. A weak outing for Santa Barbara resulted in a 66-47 loss in San Luis Obispo. UCSB was unable to stop the Mustangs’ strong offense in the second half, giving up 38 second-half points and allowing them to shoot 56.7 percent from the field. The loss was the Gauchos’ third straight to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“I definitely [think there’s a revenge factor],” Nesbit said. “Looking back on the film and watching our offensive execution, their transition offense and our transition defense, it was just horrendous. So, I think we’re excited because we know we’re a lot better than we were then.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Molly Schlemer and senior guard Kayla Griffin were especially on fire, combining for 43 points and nearly outscoring UCSB on their own. At 6’5’’, Schlemer was a problem in the post for UCSB while Griffin was 3-4 from three-point range and tallied nine rebounds, five assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“I think we took a lot of switches that last game and they exploited some of our smaller guards on Griffin in the low post area and then we also had some miscommunication in transition,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, our transition defense has to be a lot better and in the half court, we’ll try to mix things up against Schlemer. But when you don’t have 6’3’’ or 6’4’’ to guard her, you’re pretty limited on what player you decide to put on her.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s solid offensive performance against the Gauchos wasn’t a fluke either. The Mustangs rank second in the Big West in scoring offense at 68.6 points per game and lead the league in field goal percentage at 40.9 percent.</p>\n<p>“They’re a potent team,” Mitchell said. “They know that they can match you, so they’re willing to give up a basket and then get it out and they’re off to a track meet. We can’t let it become a track meet because that’s not what we do well.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, the key this week for the Gauchos will be defense, especially in transition. As the top defensive team in the Big West, holding teams to an average of 53.5 points per game, Santa Barbara is 10-5 when keeping teams less than 60 points and just 1-7 when its opponents break the 60-point mark.</p>\n<p>Despite being a Blue-Green Rivalry game, UCSB will be sporting pink gear at it plays in its annual Play 4Kay game to raise breast cancer awareness. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. Saturday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/","id":676,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[675,674,673],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Defending National Champs For Second Straight Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Facing the No. 1 team in the country, the No. 12 UCSB men’s volleyball team was unable to defeat UC Irvine last night on the road, losing 3-1 to the Anteaters for the second time this season.

In its first match, the Gauchos defeated the Tritons 3-1.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to do a whole different lineup or anything major as far as our game plan,” senior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “What’s worked, worked and we’re going to try that again.”</p>\n<p>UCSB allowed three different Triton players to score double-digit kills in its first encounter and realize defense will be critical in stopping its current losing.</p>\n<p>“The one thing we want to do is make sure their best players, or the players that have been producing – we’re really sticking on those guys to make sure they’re not playing as well,” Evans said.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match against UCSD is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/","id":5326,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5325,5324,5323],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Begins Season Against Fresno State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team will be kicking off its preseason schedule with a three-game road trip to Fresno beginning tonight to face the Bulldogs, ranked the number four team in the Mountain West Confere...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB baseball team will be kicking off its preseason schedule with a three-game road trip to Fresno beginning tonight to face the Bulldogs, ranked the number four team in the Mountain West Conference.</p>\n<p>“We are playing to win. We will have a pitch limit on our starters just because it is early in the season but they have been able to extend out and get themselves in shape enough to go out there for a hundred pitches or so,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “There will be some mixing and matching and varied lineups just because we are so young and still trying to figure out what exactly we have, but we are going to play to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is led by second year coach Checketts, who last season recorded the most wins of a first year head coach at UCSB by going 28-28. Looking to build upon last season, Checketts has recruited an impressive class to compliment returning players like junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and senior third baseman Marc Venning. The 2012 recruitment class has been ranked No. 12 in the country by Baseball America and No. 18 in the nation by Perfect Game, both being program highs. Checketts has received much of his own accolades this preseason as he has been named as a “Top 10 College Head Coach under 40” by Baseball America and a “Coach on the Rise” by Perfect Game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Along with managerial duties, Checketts is also the squads pitching coach.

The best thing to do is make sure he is hitting with nobody on base,” Checketts said. “We need to do a good job of getting the guys hitting in front of him in the lineup out. I think if we can do a good job with that I trust our pitching staff against him and that they have good enough stuff to get him out.”</p>\n<p>This weekend’s games begin at 6:35 p.m. both tonight and Saturday. Sunday’s game starts at 1:05 p.m. with Vasquez taking the mound in game one followed by sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone on Saturday, while the Sunday starter is still to be announced.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/","id":4493,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4492,4491,4490],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Running This Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As the youngest team in the Big West, the UCSB men’s basketball team has shown it can compete with the top teams in the conference.

Earlier in the season, UCSB defeated Cal Poly in an 83-81 double-overtime thriller. Emotions can certainly be expected to be running high when these two teams face off again on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We got some good practices this week, and even though we have a lot of injuries, I feel like a lot of guys are going to be healthy and ready to go by this weekend,” junior guard Kyle Boswell said. “Coming off a big win against Pacific, I feel like we’ve got some momentum rolling and a lot of us are starting to understand what it’s going to take to get some more wins and go on a winning streak in the next few games.”</p>\n<p>Last time out against the Mustangs, Boswell hit what would become a game-winning three-point play with 12 seconds left and scored the Gauchos final six points. Boswell is currently second on the team, averaging 13 points per game, and has switched roles much of the season between a starter and the sixth man.</p>\n<p>“We know playing them the first time that Cal Poly is a scrappy team and they’re talented,” Boswell said. “We’re going to have to bring a high energy level and execute at a high level in order to beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB may be without its star player in sophomore center Alan Williams who sprained his right ankle in the first half of the Pacific game. Williams has missed three games this season due to an injury to his hamstring, an injury that first occurred in that double-overtime victory against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“He’s moving around a lot better than he did when he got hurt last weekend,” Boswell said. “I can tell things are getting better, so it’d be great if he’s available for this Saturday, but if not, we’ll be ready regardless and we’ll have a chance to win whatever his status is.”</p>\n<p>With the possibility UCSB will be without its star player, the Gauchos might have to rely on freshman forward Sam Beeler to fill in for Big Al. Beeler has come on strong as of late, playing a career-high 23 minutes against Pacific in which he scored six points and grabbed four boards. Another player UCSB will rely on is junior forward Shawn Moore, a walk-on in his first season as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“That’s going to be huge because we’re going to need depth,” Boswell said. “We’ll be ready to go. Cal Poly is a good team and if we don’t all come together and basically contribute individually in order to make our team better, we’re not going to get this win this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off two straight victories over Pacific and UC Davis, and will end a three-game homestand Saturday. Overall, UCSB has won 11 of the last 12 meetings against Cal Poly and owns the all-time series record 69-31.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs are led by junior forward Chris Eversley, who is first on the team in scoring with 15.4 points per game and the only player to average double figures for Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in forward Taran Brown and guard Michael Bryson will also be pivotal in Saturday’s matchup, as each has shown flashes of brilliance this season for the Gauchos. Brown is third on the team averaging 12.1 points and Bryson is fourth at 6.9 points per game. In his last three games, however, Bryson is averaging 12.7 points and six rebounds per contest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody needs to step up,” Coach Williams said. “Injuries are not an excuse, it’s just what happens and it creates opportunities for other guys.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green rivalry game is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at Cal Poly’s Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/","id":677,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[676,675,674],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Take on Defending Champ UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Playing in its second game of a six-game road trip, the No. 15 UCSB men’s volleyball team isn’t getting any breaks from its schedule.

After losing to top ranked BYU in their previous game, the Gauchos will have a shot at redemption tonight as they face defending national champions No. 1 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Having been swept by the Anteaters earlier in the season, the Gauchos understand that execution in late game situations will be critical for them to pull out a win this time around.</p>\n<p>“It really came down to one or two plays in the later part of each game that decided that one,” freshman setter Jonah Seif said. “We know they’re beatable, they lost games this year. They won the championship last year but I think if we play as well as we can, we can definitely sweep them also.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara comes into tonight’s match with a 5-8 overall record and is 3-6 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, but has strung together good performances in recent games and will provide UCI with a serious challenge despite last week’s loss.</p>\n<p>“The loss wasn’t too detrimental to our attitude and our mood because we really played well, we just didn’t close out the match,” senior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “We’re playing Irvine with a lot of confidence, believing we can take it to them and really beat them.”</p>\n<p>However, Irvine enters as the hottest team in the league and is currently in a six-game winning streak. Currently in second place in the MPSF, the Anteaters are 10-3 overall and 7-3 in the conference, only losing once at home this season.</p>\n<p>As Irvine is led by All-American senior outside hitter Kevin Tillie, containing the Frenchman will be essential for UCSB to defeat the Anteaters. Ranking 10th in the conference in hitting percentage (.368) and sixth in kills per set (4.00), Tillie had a monster game in the previous match versus Santa Barbara, notching 18 kills with a hitting percentage of .485.</p>\n<p>“Tillie is definitely going to have his plays, we’re not going to be able to shut him down completely,” Seif said. “But definitely if we contain him, it puts a lot of pressure on the other players on their team to come up big.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off its best offensive display against BYU. In that game, four Gauchos had double-digit kills, including Evans, whose 21 kills matched a career high. UCSB will need a repeat offensive performance to offset the UCI defense. Nevertheless, defense will still be the primary focus in stopping Irvine.</p>\n<p>“Our block is going to be really important,” Evans said. “Their best player was tipping balls and that’s what we want them to do and we need to pick those up. Now that we know that they do that, we’re ready for it.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 14th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50169\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50169\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/","id":5327,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5326,5325,5324],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":158,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
