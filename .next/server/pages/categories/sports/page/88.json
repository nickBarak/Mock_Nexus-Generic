However, UCSB is aware that this will be no easy game.</p>\n<p>“Marist is a good team from the MAAC conference with a handful of international players along with a dominant force in the paint,” Coach Kay said. “They defeated SDSU in Michigan 8-6 and are expected to be a tough competitor.”</p>\n<p>The Red Foxes count on freshman utility Katie Tijerina who was named Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Women’s Water Polo Defensive Player of the Week and freshman Susan Cantoni was named MAAC Rookie of the Week after their outstanding performance at the Brown Bruno Invitational.</p>\n<p>Tijerina had three drawn ejections this past weekend along with 10 steals and one field block in four matches against No. 4 Hawaii. Cantoni contributed four goals, five assists, one steal and two field blocks this weekend.</p>\n<p>In order to fair well against the No. 21 team in the country it will be important for the Gauchos to be able to play great defense, something they have been focusing on all week.</p>\n<p>“The main focus was transition defense.” Coach Kay said.</p>\n<p>This will be critical to help the Gauchos avoid going into another overtime match, or even to maintain a lead.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the pool, Santa Barbara is very efficient in taking advantage of the first couple of possessions in the game and of power plays.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s team counts on impactful individuals such as senior center Lauren Martin who has led the team in scoring with 18 goals. Martin scored the winning goal in the sudden death overtime match against Hartwick at the Michigan Invitational. That weekend she finished with seven goals including a career high for goals scored in a single game with four.</p>\n<p>Senior attacker Bryn Hudson and junior utilities Miranda Schrader and Taylor Shore have also helped accounting for a combined 33 goals. The solid offense has helped the team achieve double digit wins in five of its first nine matches to start the season.</p>\n<p>The first game will be crucial for Santa Barbara’s performance in the tournament since it will dictate whether they advance to the next round and fight for a high ranking or fight for ninth place.</p>\n<p>The Triton invitational will be hosted by UC San Diego at the Canyonview pool where the Gauchos will face-off against Marist at 12:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68086\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/ucsb-prepared-for-triton-inviational-after-weekend-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68086\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/ucsb-prepared-for-triton-inviational-after-weekend-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/ucsb-prepared-for-triton-inviational-after-weekend-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/ucsb-prepared-for-triton-inviational-after-weekend-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/ucsb-prepared-for-triton-inviational-after-weekend-off/","id":5007,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5006,5005,5004],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jake and Joe: Dynamic Decade-Long Duo","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Jonah Seif and Jacob Delson, two of the Gauchos' top players, have a bond that goes beyond both their time at UCSB and the game of volleyball itself.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div style=\"width: 178px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"attachment-266x266 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-04-web.jpg?resize=168%2C252\" alt=\"Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"168\" height=\"252\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At home against the nation’s top team, No. 1 Long Beach State, in front of the biggest crowd of the year, Jonah Seif sets the ball for another Jacob Delson kill.

The setter and hitter came together to celebrate the latest assist-kill in a 10-year partnership between, as they call each other, Jake and Joe.</p>\n<p>Delson, a redshirt junior, and Seif, a senior, first played sports together in sixth grade when they were on the same youth basketball team. The two eventually played volleyball at rival high schools in the Conejo Valley — Jacob at Westlake High and Jonah at Thousand Oaks.</p>\n<p>In their senior year, they joined forces when Jonah decided to play for Delson’s club team. The friends insisted, however, that their decisions to commit to UCSB playing volleyball came independent of each other.</p>\n<p>“Our senior year, my club team really needed a setter, so I recruited Joe and luckily he came,” Delson said. “I committed really early, one of the earliest in our class. He was looking around for a while and eventually told me on the way back from one of our club tournaments that he was going to UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Seif is the consistent setter that has started for the Gauchos every year of his collegiate career. Delson, the passionate outside hitter who climbed up UCSB’s depth chart after redshirting, has become one of the team’s most valuable leaders.</p>\n<p>In addition to being two of the most commanding personalities on the court, the pair lead the team in several categories. Seif has made the All-MPSF First Team for the last two seasons and this year he leads the Gauchos in assists per set with 10.29. Along with the senior’s numbers, Delson thinks his setter offers more than just passing to the UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>“Jonah always brings energy and it’s great to have someone like that on the court,” Delson said. “Especially after a long point he’ll yell at me to keep me going.”</p>\n<div style=\"width: 187px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"attachment-266x266\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=177%2C266\" alt=\"Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"177\" height=\"266\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Delson cracked into the starting lineup last year, and has since taken over as one of the key players on both offense and defense. This season he is averaging the second most kills per set on the squad with 2.98 and is third in blocks with .68 per set.</p>\n<p>Seif has appreciated playing with his best friend for more than just the statistics. Jacob and Jonah lived together for the first three years of college, creating a connection that extended far beyond volleyball.</p>\n<p>“Having someone on the court that you know that well, there’s that off-the-court friendship where you trust each other to make plays,” Seif said. “I always know Jake’s defense will be there and that he’ll score big points.”</p>\n<p>After four years of playing together, the friends know each other’s patterns and tendencies as well as their own and have been key members of Gaucho teams the last two seasons. The pair has yet to win any major tournament though, and when asked what they wanted to accomplish before their college careers are over, the two had similar responses.</p>\n<p>“A championship. Or at least a deep run — I mean, only one team can win, but to make a late run at the championship would be really cool,” Delson said.</p>\n<p>Seif, who is in the middle of his final year with the Gauchos, had a more direct response.</p>\n<p>“It has to be a national championship. I’d love to not look back and think that we could’ve done more. If we do lose I want to get beat and not just lose.”</p>\n<p>This season Seif and Delson have helped the team earn a couple of impressive wins against No. 5 Loyola-Chicago and No. 11 CSUN.

The highly ranked pair have been battle tested this season against strong opponents facing and defeating the No. 4 Doubles duo in the country, senior Giuliana Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith from USC.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara is comprised of a young squad without a single senior, it has shown the promise to continue growing week by week, and set by set.</p>\n<p>“We have such a new team,we want to play good from start to finish. Everyone needs to step up, and really focus especially the first two or three shots,” Coach Thibodeau explains. “To show up like this, and tune up the team as the season goes on. There will be more potential to move up in the rankings.”</p>\n<p>Even with the rankings showcasing the recent standouts, UCSB has plenty of depth and quality ready for the opportunity to demonstrate what it is capable of. Its first test will come in the morning half of a saturday double-header against the Memphis Tigers. The Tigers began the seasn with a victory but has lost it’s last three matches.</p>\n<p>The evening portion of saturday’s contest will be against a Washington state team that has been cruising past opponents. The Cougars are coming into the weekend’s dual meet with an impressive eight game win streak, shutting out opponents 7-0 on six different occasions. Although they have not faced any ranked opponents, Washington will undoubtedly use this opportunity to test their mettle against no. 60 UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB will finish the weekend with a conference match against UC Davis. The Aggies are currently 3-2 in the season so far, defeating university of Pacific, Portland State, and UC San Diego but falling short to Santa Clara and San Diego State. They will face Santa Barbara a day after facing UCLA.</p>\n<p>Despite disappointing results Coach Thibodeau continues to work towards the goals set for the young UCSB team at the start of the 2016 season. The Gauchos expect to bounce back from their 4-3 losses and continue their way up the ranks.</p>\n<p>“We have high expectations, we want to be a top 25 team by the end of the season. We are not afraid,” Coach Thibodeau said. “We can not be afraid to win.”</p>\n<p>The first half of the saturday double headers will be held at the UCSB Recreational Center Court at 9 am PST followed by an evening contest at 5 pm PST at Ellings Park.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68092\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-look-to-bounce-back-after-slow-start-to-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68092\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-look-to-bounce-back-after-slow-start-to-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-look-to-bounce-back-after-slow-start-to-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-look-to-bounce-back-after-slow-start-to-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-look-to-bounce-back-after-slow-start-to-season/","id":117,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[116,115,114],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope to Bounce Back at UCI & LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's basketball team is looking to pick up a pair of Big West wins after losing three of its last four conference games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After being defeated by a game-winning three-pointer in the remaining seconds of last Saturday’s game against Hawaii, the UCSB women’s basketball team looks to recoup on the road at UC Irvine tonight and at Long Beach State on Saturday.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68081\" style=\"width: 201px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68081\" data-attachment-id=\"68081\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/je-zhe-newton-pushes-her-way-to-the-hoop-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Je Zhé Newton pushes her way to the hoop.

Including last Saturday’s loss, in four of five games following a 20-plus point performance, she has registered single-figures in scoring.</p>\n<p>With the Big West Conference Tournament approaching, Roper is hoping to become a more consistent scorer for UCSB on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>“Taking the game slower and step by step” Roper explained. “Not rushing anything, just letting it flow — it all starts in practice.”</p>\n<p>Occupying the Gauchos’ game plan heading into Thursday’s contest is their strategy to combat the Anteaters’ size and depth.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of dribble moves,” Henrickson said. “It’s not a traditional sit down deep, pivot and score [offense]. It’s get off the block a little bit, face you, rip and drive, back you down and spin. There’s a lot of dribbling involved and its multiple moves. So our bigs have got to stay down and keep their feet alive.”</p>\n<p>Despite the versatility within their frontcourt, the Anteaters haven’t had much production offensively this season. Overall, they rank last in field goal percentage at 34.4 percent, three-point percentage at 22.3 percent and their average of 12.1 assists per game ranks eighth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Irvine’s defense has emerged during its lack of offense. The Anteaters have held three of their last four opponents under 60 points and recently allowed a season-low 50 points in their loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>A central figure within UCI’s stout defense has been the play of Mokun Fajemisin. A junior forward, Fajemisin grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds and had two blocks against the Mustangs. Her total of 40 blocks and 2.0 rejections per game leads the Big West. In addition, Fajemisin ranks fifth in the Big West in rebounds per game with a 7.7 average and a total of 154 rebounds this year.</p>\n<p>Her blocking abilities have influenced the rest of the team since the start of Big West play as the Anteaters lead the conference with an average of 4.6 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Finding a way to combat UCI’s size will be most important for the Gauchos, who are depleted in size this season.</p>\n<p>Closing out UCSB’s road trip is its matchup against Long Beach State. The 49ers are coming off of a 22-10 season last year in which they put together a 15-game winning streak at one point, but faltered during the conference schedule as they finished with a 9-7 record.</p>\n<p>LBSU was knocked out of the first round of the Big West Conference Tournament by CSUF, then loss in the first round of the WNIT to San Diego.</p>\n<p>In the midst of a five-game winning streak and in second place, the 49ers may be in route to a strong finish to conference play. Thus far, it has been Long Beach’s defense that has led it to such a solid start.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ average of 21.5 turnovers forced per game leads the Big West and ranks 12th in the nation. Despite nearly being upset and allowing 71 points in an overtime win at CSUN, Long Beach State has held 12 opponents to 60 points or fewer and five to under 50 points this season.</p>\n<p>Complementing the 49ers’ defense is their shooting from behind the three-point line. They rank third in the Big West in three-point percentage at 32 percent. Most notably, LBSU set a single-game program and Big West record of 20 three-pointers made in its 82-61 victory at CSUF.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UCI is set for 7 p.m. tonight at the Bren Events Center. The Gauchos game at LBSU will take place on Saturday, Feb. 13 at 4 p.m. in Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 11, 2016’s print edition of the

The Gauchos will have to pay close attention to two of the Boilermakers top hitters, shortstop Paris Andrew and designated player Katie Harrison, both of whom batted over .300 in 2015. The Boilermakers have won both previous matchups with the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play a second game on Friday afternoon against Nebraska-Omaha, which also experienced a tough 2015 season. The Mavericks finished with a record of 22-28 overall, and may face a rougher fate in 2016 as they lost multiple key players including two of their starting pitchers. However, this is a good hitting team which scores lots of runs, and looks to put pressure on the Gaucho defense.</p>\n<p>One of the Maverick’s biggest stars is junior outfielder and right hand pitcher Lizzie Noble, who hit .294 last year, scoring 27 runs and knocking in 36 RBI’s. Senior infielder Campbell Ditto will also be a player to look for, as she scored 24 runs and finds a way to get on base despite her .242 average. Lizzie Noble, who only saw the mound 10 times last season, will be the expected starter for Friday’s match.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos will face both the Southern Utah and North Texas. Senior left fielder Kylee Wolf is expected to command the Southern Utah squad this year, as she led her team in hits and runs last year and had the third highest batting average on the team.</p>\n<p>This year will likely be one of transition and player development for North Texas, as they added eight freshmen to their roster and lost their top three hitters from last season, all of whom averaged over .300 at the plate.</p>\n<p>To close out this weekend’s invitational, the Gauchos take on the host Arizona Wildcats. In perhaps their toughest game of the tournament, the Gauchos will face an Arizona team which last season had 11 players batting over .300, and two of which hit over .400. The Gauchos will be put to the test, as many of Arizona’s hitters have returned this year to form a powerful batting lineup.</p>\n<p>Wildcat junior outfielder Alexis Dotson finished last season with an outstanding batting average of .435. Her teammate, junior outfielder Katiyana Mauga, hit .350 at the plate, good for the fourth best average on the team. In addition to Arizona’s intimidating offense, junior right handed pitcher Michelle Floyd can bring the heat as she struck out 135 last season to go with her 3.62 ERA, and will look to shut down the Gauchos lineup.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has a series of tough games this weekend, it has strengths of its own, and will undoubtedly put pressure on its opponents. As a team, the Gauchos have a respectable batting average of .296, and an on base percentage of .371. They have four players in their lineup batting over .300. Outfielder Kristen Clark, who is a junior, leads the team with a batting average of .356.</p>\n<p>In addition, sophomore outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa leads the team with a .483 on base percentage. Senior catcher Meshalon Moore is also a team leader in multiple categories, as she scored 33 runs last season to go with her 42 RBI’s. Senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow and senior pitcher Alex Pingree are both reliable starters for this Gaucho squad, and should improve upon their collective 114 strikeouts from last season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue to be a competitive and entertaining team this year, and this weekend’s preseason action against solid teams will serve to sharpen their hitting, pitching and defense. Look for the Gauchos to be a solid contender in Big West play this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 11, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily

Despite the Gauchos’ recent struggles, they still sit at number ten in the national rankings.</p>\n<p>Traveling to Utah to face one of the nation’s best in BYU, the Gauchos headed to Provo—which was nearly fifty degrees colder than Isla Vista on Saturday—for back to back games against the Cougars.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the first match of the weekend, the Gauchos’ first televised match of the season, the visitors started out slow, and never fully got a grasp of the meeting, losing in straight sets (20-25, 16-25, 24-26). The pair of three-point runs in the first set were the longest runs of the night for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We had trouble with serving against BYU,” senior middle blocker Ryan Hardy said. “We weren’t aggressive enough to get them out of system and we compounded the problem with a lot of serving errors.”</p>\n<p>Hardy had the best offensive performance on a night when the Gauchos’ offense wasn’t playing at its usual level. The middle blocker registered 5 kills with a .833 kill percentage, but even UCSB’s most consistent players thus far this season couldn’t find their groove.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh led the team with 8 kills, but also had a team high 7 hitting errors. Senior setter Jonah Seif, who has hardly played a bad pass all year, registered his season-low in assists with 28.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB had similar troubles. The California team doubled BYU’s hitting errors with 16 in another straight set loss (17-25, 23-25, 14-25). Marsh tallied 11 kills in the loss, the only Gaucho to reach double digits in either of the weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>BYU’s home court advantage, known as one of the best in college volleyball, was evident in both matches, with cold weather, thin air, and big crowds all adding to the difficult task of playing against the number three team in the nation.</p>\n<p>“The Smith Fieldhouse averages almost 4,000 fans every game, so it’s a really tough environment to play in,” Hardy said.</p>\n<p>The two losses to BYU were the Gauchos’ first two straight set losses of the season, but Hardy and his teammates, despite their disappointment with their showing in Utah, are working to get to a point where they can start beating the best teams in the stacked MPSF.</p>\n<p>“We have to battle if we want to get ahead in this league and not take any team lightly. The MPSF is very competitive and we need to be prepared every game in order to be a top team.”</p>\n<p>Even with its recent trouble, UCSB sits only three games behind conference leaders and national no. 2 UCLA. With a slightly easier pair of home matches this week against Irvine and UCSD, the Gauchos already have their sights on getting back on the winning track, as their two visitors have combined for a 2-14 record in league play.</p>\n<p>“The losing streak is behind us. We can only focus on the matches coming up. We’re working hard this week and are looking forward to playing Irvine on our turf Wednesday.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play UC Irvine at Rob Gym on Wednesday at 7 p.m. The Gauchos will then face UC San Diego at Rob Gym on Friday at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68027\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/gauchos-cant-stop-byu-extend-losing-streak-to-three/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68027\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/gauchos-cant-stop-byu-extend-losing-streak-to-three/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/gauchos-cant-stop-byu-extend-losing-streak-to-three/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/gauchos-cant-stop-byu-extend-losing-streak-to-three/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/gauchos-cant-stop-byu-extend-losing-streak-to-three/","id":5061,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5060,5059,5058],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 48 UCSB Able to Capture 4-2 Victory Over No. 43 Pepperdine on Sunday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-11-15_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-11-15_9-web.jpg?resize=461%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Still on its road journey, the No. 48 UCSB men's tennis team was able to earn its second consecutive win with a 4-2 win against No. 43 Pepperdine on Sunday.

The Gauchos’ duo defeated Jack Van Slyke and Tom Hill 6-3 to give UCSB the lead heading into singles play.</p>\n<p>Despite dropping the doubles point, the Waves looked to crawl back into the match with a few early singles victories to knot the match back in a tie. Lautaro Pane took a straight set win on court four and his teammate Gabriel Sydney followed up on court six with a similar outcome to produce Pepperdine’s only points on the day.</p>\n<p>Mays took home the first singles match for Santa Barbara as he played on court three for the first time this season. The Gaucho captain won convincingly as he only dropped five total games, beating Pedro Iamachkine 6-2, 6-3.</p>\n<p>“I got a good win today and it was great to play outdoors in my home town again,” Mays said. “I played some good tennis and it helped our team to a win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos closed the match out with a few tie-breaker wins on the lower courts. Cody Rakela picked up his first singles win of the season as he dominated Van Slyke on the tie-breaker giving him an overall win 6-4, 7-6 (7-1). No. 81 Nicolas Moreno de Alboran sealed the 4-2 win for Santa Barbara with a very slim straight set victory that called tie-breakers in both sets. When it was all over the freshman emerged 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6).</p>\n<p>The final singles match on court one was halted in the third set when Santa Barbara secured its victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take the courts again this weekend when they head to Grand Canyon University on Saturday, Feb. 13.

UCSB regained the lead from a made free-throw by sophomore forward Chaya Durr with 24 seconds remaining, but was defeated by Hawaii’s drive and kick play call that resulted in Karaitiana’s clutch shot from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 8-15 overall, 5-4 in conference play which places it in fifth place of the Big West standings. Hawaii earned its fourth consecutive win to improve to 14-9 overall while wins over Cal Poly and UCSB landed the Rainbow Wahine in third place with a 7-3 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Karaitiana finished with 12 points on 5-7 shooting and went 2-3 from behind the three-point line. Tallying a game-high 17 points was senior guard Destiny King, who was most effective at the free-throw line making 9-12.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB finished with one more made field goal than Hawaii, the Gauchos’ offense was unable to score a basket to open the game. UCSB concluded the first half 8-30 from the field and were 1-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>It was a frustrating shooting night for UCSB’s top two scorers in backcourt members sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller. They shot a combined 4-23 from the field with Roper ending with six points and Miller with five as the two were responsible for two of the team’s total of three three-point field goals. Yet, UCSB rebounded in the second half shooting 40 percent.</p>\n<p>Unlike UCSB, Hawaii established its offensive presence and was successful as it shot 45.8 percent from the field in the first two quarters. It was most efficient shooting the ball in the first period of Saturday’s game. The Rainbow Wahine registered a 61. 5 shooting percentage and closed the quarter on a 9-2 run to take a 16-9 lead.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch extended to a 14-2 run to open the second quarter which handed Hawaii a double-figure lead of 22-9.</p>\n<p>Despite the absence of its primary scorers, UCSB’s bench played a pivotal role in its gradual comeback prior to entering halftime. Junior center Je Zhe Newton tallied her first double-double of the season with 12 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>As Hawaii was in route to widening the scoring gap between it and UCSB, a three-pointer by senior guard Dioseline Lopez energized UCSB’s performance on the court in addition to trimming Hawaii’s lead to a five-point deficit.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s last six points of the second quarter was senior guard Jasmine Ware. She ended Saturday with 10 points in 29 minutes while going 3-6 shooting the ball and 4-4 from the free-throw line. Still, Hawaii entered halftime with a 31-24 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in its comeback effort in the second half was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She shot a perfect 3-3 from the field in the third quarter to go along with three assists and six points. Jemerigbe led UCSB in scoring with 13 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the third quarter on a 7-0 run which expanded into an 11-2 run in the beginning of the fourth quarter, resulting in UCSB taking a 45-41 lead. It was a high-scoring fourth quarter as the two teams combined for 44 points.</p>\n<p>Three lead changes and two ties occurred within the fourth quarter. Although both teams exchanged baskets, it was Karaitiana that provided the edge for UCSB. Prior to her game-winning three-pointer, she had seven points in the quarter and made her only three-pointers of the game in the final period to help lead the Rainbow Wahine to their 63-62 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to UC Davis this Thursday, Feb. 11 and will face the Aggies in the Bren Events Center at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68000\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68000\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/","id":391,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[390,389,388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Resurgent Second Half Performance Earns 81-68 Win vs. CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A total of 54 points scored in the second half helped the UCSB men's basketball team to overcome a seven-point deficit coming out of halftime.

The Gauchos responded with improved energy and effort coming out of halftime, outhustling Fullerton in statistical categories that included rebounding, assists, field goal percentage, and ball possession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara controlled the pace of the game in every facet of the second half— shooting 66 percent from the field and 77 percent from downtown while it contained the Titans for the majority of Saturday’s contest, holding CSUF to a dismal overall field goal percentage of 38 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on their trips to the line as well, making 13-17 on the night from behind the stripe to finish with a 76.5 free-throw percentage, a major improvement from their 53.8 percent outing against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Influencing UCSB’s improvement on offense in the second half was its ability to penetrate the Titans’ defense when driving the ball.</p>\n<p>“We got great space off of our drives [in the second half],” Williams said. “Our penetration created open shots for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB was poised when handling the ball. It concluded Satuday’s game with just nine turnovers, a total below the Gauchos’ season average of 13.3 per game.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Eric Childress played a major role in UCSB’s victory Saturday night, registering only one turnover in the game’s entirety.</p>\n<p>Childress, learning from his six point and five turnover performance last Thursday against Hawaii, was aggressive with his attack which provided a much-needed boost behind scoring threats Gabe Vincent and Michael Bryson. The Hawthorne, CA native finished with 13 points and seven assists on the night.</p>\n<p>“Eric was shooting the ball under great control and had great poise,” Williams said. “He looked so in control of his game offensively and it really caused problems for Fullerton’s guards.”</p>\n<p>Childress’ control of the ball also resulted in more scoring opportunities for Vincent and Bryson. The two tallied 45 points Saturday night, 20 for the sophomore guard and 25 for the senior Bryson. It was an efficient shooting night for Vincent as he finished 7-15 from the floor and made a game-high 5-7 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to be aggressive and look for shots to attack,” Vincent said. “We can always get shots up from the perimeter, I was hitting the three tonight, but I was really trying to get out in transition and get to the rim.”</p>\n<p>Bryson also flirted with a triple-double, grabbing a game-high nine rebounds and tying Childress’ game-high of seven assists. His 25-point performance helped him to climb to eighth-place on the Gauchos’ all-time scoring list.</p>\n<p>Young players like Jarriesse Blackmon contributed quality minutes this weekend as well. While the freshman forward did not score in his nine minutes of action, the Salt Lake City native pulled down a career-high eight boards for his team, five of them offensive rebounds giving UCSB second chance opportunities.</p>\n<p>“[Jarriese] is not afraid of the moment and not afraid to try and make plays,” Williams stated. “He’s a high energy guy and that’s what we needed out of him tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will hope to take Saturday’s home victory and use its momentum for the team’s two-game road trip starting at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“[We need to take] the energy, enthusiasm, and accountability we played with tonight into next week,” Williams said. “[Our guys] understand that we’ve dug ourselves a whole and the only way to get out of it is by playing hard and playing better.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to the Pavillion on Thursday, Feb. 11 to face the Aggies. Tip-off will take place at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67996\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67996\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/","id":339,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[338,337,336],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Road Journey Continues for No. 48 Gauchos, Play No. 44 Pepperdine Sunday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a 2-3 start to finish the first month of its season, the UCSB men's tennis team heads to Malibu, CA to face No. 44 Pepperdine.

Anders fell in the first set and was able to win the next two straight despite suffering an ankle injury in the second set.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have found success in singles play this year, they truly have struggled on the doubles side and must find a way to improve as conference play slowly approaches.</p>\n<p>So far this season, Santa Barbara has only won the doubles point one time in its five matches and has lost the last four straight. Aside from the doubles point itself, the Gauchos have only won five of their fifteen doubles matches.</p>\n<p>This Sunday’s match will be the closest thing that the Gauchos will have to a home match as the team will not host one until late February when they open the home season with Pacific.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara plays its first nine matches on the road with just two in California.

Vincent tallied in nine of UCSB’s first 15 points, scoring the first bucket of the game off a spot up three-pointer. The Stockton native shot 4-6 in the half.</p>\n<p>Despite only trailing 36-33 at the half, UCSB was unable to find its groove offensively shooting 11-34 from the field including 5-19 from downtown. A stagnant offense and 14 turnovers propelled Hawaii to an 11-4 run over UCSB, extending the Rainbow Warriors’ lead to 47-40 with 13:45 remaining. Hawaii never trailed after this point in the game.</p>\n<p>While neither team was able to establish an offensive presence until five minutes remained in the second half, Coach Williams was not pleased with his team’s lack of energy.</p>\n<p>“Two of the last three games [at home] we’ve come out with minimal effort and its unacceptable,” Williams said. “It’s hard to explain why you would have better energy [on the road] than in your own house.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently 1-3 this year in conference games when playing in the Thunderdome. While UCSB has managed to find its rhythm against tough teams on the road, it hasen’t had the best record as of late defending home court.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we feed off the crowd on the road, or maybe it’s an us-against-the-world attitude, but either way we are definitely a better team away from home,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Despite a tough loss, freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak made his presence known down low. In his 13<sup>th</sup> start of the season, the 6’7” forward battled it out with Hawaii’s frontcourt of  Mike Thomas and Stefan Jankovic, finishing with six points off 3-5 shooting.</p>\n<p>While his stat line wasn’t the greatest, Kupchak came up clutch when his team needed him finishing at the rim within closing seconds of the first half slicing the lead to three. Kupchak also had another strong drive with 7:46 to play, pulling his team to a 56-54 deficit.</p>\n<p>“Max is a real smart player, his basketball IQ is very high especially for a freshman,” Vincent said of his fellow teammate. “He knows how to play the game so we’ve been getting some good minutes from him especially with John [Green] going down. We need more from [Max] and it will come.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii also took advantage of its trips to the free-throw line, scoring 22 points behind the stripe compared to seven for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to avenge their loss this Saturday, Feb. 6 as they will face Cal State Fullerton. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67963\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67963\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/","id":371,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[370,369,368],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl 50 Key Matchups: Defense Wins Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sb-mashup-pic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sb-mashup-pic.jpg?resize=854%2C538&ssl=1","description":"Just three days away from the kickoff of Super Bowl 50 between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers, the Daily Nexus Sports Staff broke down the primary matchups and advantages heading into Sunday...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Forget all that stress from midterms.

Or will he show up as the 39 year-old whom we’ve seen regress heavily in the past year. Manning will more than likely walk off the gridiron for the last time this Sunday and, win or lose, he will go down as one of the greatest to do it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, whether he wins or not, his last few seasons in this league were not at all an accurate portrayal of the Manning we have grown to know. He has been stricken with injuries, thrown for all-time lows and was even benched in the same game in which he broke the NFL’s all-time passing record.</p>\n<p>He’s thrown a career low nine TD’s this year, along with his fewest completions, his most picks since 2010, and, for the first time in his career, he didn’t play and start in every game. This is surely not the same Peyton Manning that won five MVPs.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, Peyton is widely known as being very unsuccessful in the Postseason, with a record of just 13-13 in his 18 seasons and only one Super Bowl win out of three tries.</p>\n<p>Now, with sports being the beautiful and unpredictable animal that it is, we can by no means count this man out. With the incredible receiving options he has around him, Manning could very well come out and have an above average day if he can just tap into what ever talent and youth he has left in the tank. What makes this a tall task are those men in blue on the other side of the ball.</p>\n<p>Carolina is known to have a great defense, especially in their front seven with a player like Luke Kuechly handling the run game very well, but what about those who stop the pass? The Panthers have been blessed to feature what may be the most improved corner in the league this season in Josh Norman, who picked up career bests in every defensive stat this year, excluding tackling. Norman had four picks, three forced fumbles and two defensive TD’s this year, but more importantly he became a truly lock-down corner.</p>\n<p>Robert McClain, Kurt Coleman, Roman Harper, Cortland Finnegan and Teddy Williams join him to make up this very talented secondary that reeled in the most interceptions during the regular season and has allowed the least passes in the playoffs so far.</p>\n<p>When looking at this matchup I truly see the thick of the game coming down to how well Peyton can play against this very talented passing defense. The Broncos have great receiving options in Emmanuel Sanders, Demaryius Thomas, Owen Daniels and Vernon Davis whom will be covered well by a talented Panthers defense that will result in a stalemate.</p>\n<p>The Carolina Panthers will be Super Bowl champions unless Peyton shows up as the great player we have grown up with and makes the super star plays he has been known to make, albeit in the regular season as opposed to on the biggest stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Cam Newton vs. Broncos Defense by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>While Peyton Manning and Cam Newton exchanged praises for each other at the Super Bowl 50 media day, one of the many attractions entering Sunday’s game is how well Newton will fair against the Denver Broncos’ defense.</p>\n<p>Entitled is a matchup between one of this season’s best quarterbacks going head-to-head with the NFL’s No.1 defense. Yet, it is no shock that Newton has garnered most of the spotlight thanks to his MVP caliber play this season.</p>\n<p>This season, the Panthers star quarterback set a new career high in passing touchdowns with 35 in the regular season, which tied for second best in the league. He also tied for fifth in the NFL in rushing touchdowns with 10 — the next closest quarterback on the list was Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ rookie QB Jameis Winston with six.</p>\n<p>Last week in the NFC championship game against Arizona, Newton threw for 335 yards and two touchdowns, an encouraging sign that he is still hot heading into the Golden Super Bowl. However, Newton has had his fair share of struggles when facing good defenses this season.</p>\n<p>Although the Panthers dominated the Seahawks for the most part in their divisional matchup, Newton was average, throwing for only 161 yards and rushing for three yards on 11 carries. In Carolina’s only loss of the season in week 16, Newton was pressured immensely by Atlanta, being held to 142 passing yards and 46 rushing yards.</p>\n<p>Point being, when Newton is pressured he starts to play a bit more poorly than usual — as do most quarterbacks. Unfortunately for Newton, this Sunday the former No. 1 overall pick will face off against possibly the best pass rushing defense he has seen in his five-year career.</p>\n<p>The Broncos’ defense has dominated all year long as the No. 1 total defense, No. 1 against the pass and No. 3 against the rush. Most notably, it has been Denver’s pass rush which has been most valuable. In the regular season, the Broncos led the league in sacks with 52.</p>\n<p>Last week, Denver hit the Patriots’ star quarterback Tom Brady 17 times. It was the most the quarterback had been hit in a game this season, including the postseason. Newton has yet to be hit more than six times in any game this season.</p>\n<p>However, just as Newton has never faced a pass rush like the Broncos, subsequently Denver has never faced a quarterback like Cam Newton, which is what makes this matchup so great.</p>\n<p>The most rushing yards by a quarterback against the Broncos was Alex Smith, who ran for 33 yards, but Newton and Smith are two completely different quarterbacks. The unpredictability of Newton’s talents is what might be the determining factor come Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>At this point, it seems clear that the Broncos defense holds the advantage. One player cannot possibly beat an entire defense. Then again, not many players, let alone QB’s, can match Cam Newton’s skillset. Part of the intrigue will be to see if he can overcome the best defense in the NFL.</p>\n<p><strong>Broncos Rushing Offense vs. Panthers Front 7 by Elliot Thornton </strong></p>\n<p>They say numbers never lie and as cliché this statement may be, it could well be a recipe for success for Head Coach Gary Kubiak and the Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Denver is 8-0 this season when its ground and pound game rushes for 130-plus yards. With the combination of a downhill rusher like C.J. Anderson and the finesse of Ronnie Hillman in the backfield, Kubiak will likely take this stat into account as he helps to prepare the Broncos’ offensive scheme for Super Bowl 50. While the Panthers’ defense, especially their front seven, has been impressive this season, the Broncos know running the ball effectively will play a key part in their ability to move the chains.</p>\n<p>It’s no secret that Peyton Manning’s throwing arm doesn’t possess the same amount of strength and precision it once did. Although he still retains the knowledge and ability to manage a game, the Broncos’ ability to establish their rushing attack will be pivotal in aiding their aging quarterback.</p>\n<p>Despite a lethargic start to begin the season, Denver’s run game gradually improved as the year progressed. Both Hillman and Anderson have proven to be clutch in the post season, coming up huge during the team’s game-winning drive against the Steelers. While Anderson wasn’t as dominant against the Patriots in their second matchup, the former Cal Bear led all rushers with 72 yards, including a rumbling 30-yard pickup in the fourth quarter that set up the game deciding field goal. His hardnosed running style will be a vital factor in the Broncos’ chances of earning a victory in the matchup against the physical front of the Panthers.</p>\n<p>The Panthers’ front seven on defense, led by the All-Pro linebacker duo of Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis, could very well prove to be the deciding factor in this year’s Super Bowl. Kuechly leads the team this postseason with 19 tackles, while Thomas has 11 after leaving the NFC championship game with a broken forearm. While he is planning to play with a brace in the Super Bowl, it remains to be seen how effective he can be with only one fully functioning arm.</p>\n<p>These two linebackers, as well as Kurt Coleman, who leads the team with two interceptions this postseason, headline an aggressive front seven that gave Carson Palmer nightmares during the NFC championship. Fast and intelligent, they will need to be on their toes against Manning and all of his deceptive play calling at the line of scrimmage.</p>\n<p>The Panthers’ defense altered what should have been two hard fought battles this postseason against the Seahawks and Cardinals into near blowout victories with their smart, opportunistic play complementing their explosive offense led by likely MVP Cam Newton.</p>\n<p>Yet enhancing the narrative of Sunday’s game is the curiosity of if the “Sheriff” can dig deep and orchestrate one more victory to top off one of the greatest quarterbacking careers of all time. If Manning can manage to prevent from turning the ball over, the Broncos’ defense might have what it takes to keep Denver within reach for earning its third Super Bowl victory in franchise history.</p>\n<p>However, the edge overall must go to Carolina and its dynamic leader in Newton alongside the Panthers’ ferocious defense, which has taken the league by storm this year with aspirations of becoming the NFL’s next dynasty.</p>\n<p><strong>Broncos Defense/Special Teams vs. Panthers Defense/Special Teams by Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>It’s fairly common that a defensive or special team’s play can end up having a huge impact on the outcome of the Super Bowl. Just ask the Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Two years ago in Super Bowl 48, Denver lost 43-8 to Seattle, and a long interception return TD for Seahawks’ Malcolm Smith sucked the hope out of the Broncos in the second quarter. Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin delivered the final blow on the kickoff of the second half, returning it 87 yards for a touchdown.</p>\n<p>In this season’s edition of the February classic, two of the premier defenses in the NFL will battle for the crown. Denver definitely comes into the games with the edge, though, as they led the league in the regular season with a stingy 283.1 yards allowed per game and a fourth-best 18.5 points allowed per game.</p>\n<p>Denver’s all-around solid team defense will have to outperform Carolina’s explosive, hard-hitting D led by lockdown cornerback Kurt Coleman and all-pro linebacker Luke Kuechly. The Panthers had a league-high 23 interceptions in the regular season and like their offense, plays with an edge that often gets on the nerves of their opponents. Cornerback Josh Norman has had on-field scraps with several top wide-outs, such as Dez Bryant and Julio Jones, and the frustration has to stem from how tough and gritty the Carolina defense really is.</p>\n<p>As for special teams, neither team has had any explosive players this season, with the Broncos’ Omar Bolden the only player in the Super Bowl with a return touchdown this season. Broncos’ kicker Brandon McManus has hit 85.7 percent of his field goals with a season high 57-yarder, while Panthers’ kicker Graham Gano is similarly successful, converting 83.3 percent of his FGs with a long of 52-yards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 10 &amp; 11 of February 4, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/","id":1997,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1996,1995,1994],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pummel CSUF in 79-49 Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-12-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team ended its two-game losing streak with a 79-49 rout of Cal State Fullerton Wednesday night.

It was a strong offensive start for Jemerigbe as well as her total of eight point in Wednesday’s game all appeared in the opening quarter on 3-3 shooting.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s efficient shooting start to the game resulted in it registering 61.1 field goal and 55.6 three-point percentages, contributing to its 18-6 run to end the quarter with a 28-11 lead.</p>\n<p>A slight decline in the Gauchos’ shooting to begin the second quarter influenced the Titans’ 7-2 scoring stretch. A run sparked by a three-pointer by freshman forward Michelle Berry nearly brought Fullerton within a 10-point deficit of the Gauchos’ lead at 18-30.</p>\n<p>Although Berry led the Titans in scoring with 17 points, the three-point make in the second quarter was her lone field goal from beyond the arc. Despite entering Wednesday night ranked second in the Big West in total three-pointers made, Fullerton shot 5-13 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Five points in the second period helped Roper end the first half with 20 points as the Gauchos went into halftime with a 46-26 lead.</p>\n<p>Guaranteeing UCSB’s victory was its 22-8 outscoring of the Titans in the third quarter. Leading UCSB’s offensive surge to start the second half was Miller with seven points while Roper secured her game-high total with five points in the quarter. Senior guard Jasmine Ware tallied six of her 12 points in the quarter as well.</p>\n<p>Yet, it was the Gauchos’ prowess on defense that was most effective. Santa Barbara restrained CSUF to a 27.3 field goal percentage while also holding the Titans scoreless for the remaining 5:50 of the period.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which CSUF managed to outscore UCSB 15-11. Complementing Berry was freshman guard Dani Craig, who finished as the Titans only other player to score in double-figures with 11 points.</p>\n<p>But the Gauchos went on to earn their largest lead in the game at the 4:51 mark of the fourth quarter to take a 77-38 lead, eventually defeating the Titans 79-49.</p>\n<p>Aiding the UCSB in its containment of Fullerton’s three-point shooting was its conference game-high total of 44 rebounds in which the Gauchos grabbed a conference game-best of 28 defensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Hawaii this Saturday at 2 p.m. in the Thunderdome. The Rainbow Wahine were projected to finish in first place of the conference standings in the Big West Preseason Poll.

This tends to be extremely misleading, especially in sports where numbers don’t quite translate to show a player’s true value.</p>\n<p>When comparing careers as a whole, we generally stick to one golden rule when talking about what number matters most: rings.</p>\n<p>Dan Marino is perhaps the most well-known example in football of how misleading this can be, as the legendary quarterback failed to ever win a ring despite setting just about every passing record there was to set. He would forever be overshadowed by Joe Montana and his four Super Bowl rings, a record for quarterbacks that still stands today.</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to see who the present-day equivalents of Marino and Montana are. Peyton Manning and Tom Brady have followed the same storyline as their predecessors nearly to the tee since they rose to prominence in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>Brady quickly took up the Montana role, racking up three rings from 2001-2004 as the Patriots dominated the football world with unprecedented postseason success. Over the years, he has made his own individual marks on the record books, albeit nowhere close to the success Manning has had in that respect. However, a fourth Super Bowl win in 2015 brought Brady into a tie with Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the most ever for quarterbacks, further establishing him as potentially the greatest signal-caller of all time.</p>\n<p>On the other side, no matter how well Peyton Manning has done in the regular season, postseason success has almost always found a way to evade him. Whether it’s due to costly interceptions, missed field goals, or freak plays down the stretch, Peyton has managed a 13-13 career playoff record and the most losses of any quarterback, compared to Brady’s magnificent mark of 22-9.</p>\n<p>The key difference between Manning and Marino in the playoffs is the fact that Manning did manage to pull off one Cinderella run in 2006, when his Indianapolis Colts defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17 on a rainy day in Miami. Nevertheless, as he continued rewriting the history books and bringing his MVP tally to an all-time best mark of five, Manning still could never find a way to erase the doubts of his greatness.</p>\n<p>After all, Peyton’s little brother, Eli, who has never come close in the statistics argument, has two rings of his own; ironically, both having been earned against Brady and the Patriots.</p>\n<p>It is too late for Peyton to reach the mark set by Brady and Montana, but this Sunday, his legacy will have everything on the line. Lose, and he likely finishes his career with a 1-3 record in Super Bowls, more evidence for the doubters that more times than not, he failed to get the job done when it mattered most.</p>\n<p>Win, and he gets a John Elway-like send off, potentially ending his career on the highest note possible while finally getting that elusive second ring.</p>\n<p>Ironically, if Peyton wins that second ring, he would be achieving it during what is by far the worst statistical year of his legendary career.</p>\n<p>Just how bad was it? Excluding the 2011 season which he sat out due to multiple neck surgeries, Peyton finished 2015 with the least completions, yards, touchdowns, QB rating and games played of his career. In a game against Cleveland, he broke the all-time record for passing yards minutes before being benched for the first time ever. That was his season in a nutshell.</p>\n<p>Although he was on the field far less than we are accustomed to, when he did play, mistakes were in abundance. He averaged 1.7 interceptions per game, the most since his rookie season, when he averaged 1.75.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Peyton, he gets one more chance to win a ring thanks to the greatest defense he has ever had behind him, a defense that won the Broncos the No. 1 seed in the AFC despite playing with an inconsistent offense that is still searching for  answers.</p>\n<p>Peyton knows better than anyone in this game how defense can win a championship. It was only two years ago that the greatest offensive season in history was demolished 43-8 by the Seattle Seahawks and the league’s top defensive unit.</p>\n<p>It’d be a shame to see him go down like that one more time. Fortunately for his fans, he has looked spryer than he has all season in his last couple performances, looking to have put the plantar fasciitis that forced him to miss time behind him.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens, this Sunday will be a day to remember in the legendary story of Peyton Manning, football’s greatest student.</p>\n<p>Let’s just hope the referee doesn’t ruin things with a controversial coin toss.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67920\" style=\"width: 488px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67920\" data-attachment-id=\"67920\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/2016-2-2-football/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2016 2 2 football\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67920\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=478%2C359\" alt=\"Emily Zhang/ Daily Nexus\" width=\"478\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67920\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Zhang/ Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Panther’s Balanced Attack Could Ensure Last Rodeo of Manning Era </strong></p>\n<p><strong>By Sean White</strong></p>\n<p>Despite becoming the first team to win the NFC South in back-to-back seasons last year, Carolina’s 7-8-1 finish to crawl into the playoffs was not an astounding achievement as each team in the division concluded the season with a losing record.</p>\n<p>As part of a mediocre division along with the losses of No. 1 Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn left ACL and a farewell to nine-year veteran Halfback DeAngelo Williams, ending the Panthers’ coveted dual-threat rushing attack alongside Johnathan Stewart, many were convinced that a lackluster season was in store for Carolina.</p>\n<p>But just like the fearless superhero he has constantly portrayed himself to be, the heroic breakout season of Panthers’ Quarterback Cam Newton has amazed the entire National Football League with his incomparable play on the field to help the Panthers finish with a 15-1 regular season record.</p>\n<p>With “Super Cam” at the helm, it may not be too early for Coach Rivera to consider which finger he will have fitted for his second Super Bowl ring. Yet, it can be assured that the primary objective is earning Carolina its first of the famed piece of jewelry.</p>\n<p>The same applies for Newton, who is in search of his first Super Bowl ring and has helped guide the Carolina Panthers to their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. While a Panthers-Patriots rematch of Super Bowl XXXVIII would have made the headlines ever more intriguing for Sunday’s game, the opportunity to see Newton play on the game’s most remarkable stage is just as fascinating.</p>\n<p>He set regular season career-highs in passing touchdowns and passer rating with 35 and 99.4 percent, respectively, while throwing a career-low 10 interceptions. Newton complemented his attack through the air with his rushing abilities as well, registering a career-high 8.2 rush attempts per game while collecting 636 yards and 10 rushing touchdowns.</p>\n<p>While it’s inevitable to dislike the charismatic celebrations and giveaways of footballs to children in the crowd after scoring a touchdown, there remains a lack of attention to the level of proficiency he has consistently played with all season long.</p>\n<p>Specifically, his reliability in the Panthers’ redzone trips on offense have been overlooked. He ranked third in the NFL during the regular season when in opponents’ redzone, throwing for 26 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Nonetheless, Newton has performed best in the fourth quarter of games, registering a 64.3 completion percentage and a 110.4 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>Just like the calm, cool and collected persona that the QB displays, he has been a vital element in the Panthers’ success on third down helping to extend offensive drives. Carolina’s 42.4 third down conversion percentage ranked seventh in the NFL during the regular season. The Panthers’ offense has increased their efficiency when facing possible three and out situations in the postseason now at a 55.2 percentage.</p>\n<p>If I had the privilege of voting for this year’s MVP it would be in favor of Newton, however, I remain a firm believer in the old adage that ‘defense wins championships.’</p>\n<p>Though Carolina ranked a few spots lower than Denver in total defense, pass yards allowed and rush yards allowed, the Panthers’ mastery of takeaways provides the best balance to their dynamic offense.</p>\n<p>Carolina led the NFL with a plus-20 differential between its takeaways and giveaways. Its defense led the league with a total of 39 takeaways while also garnering league-highs in interceptions with 24 and fumble recoveries with 15.</p>\n<p>Leading the Panthers’ stout defense is three-time First Team All-Pro Middle Linebacker Luke Kuechly. Assisting in either run defense or pass coverage alongside veteran linebacker Thomas Davis, it is Kuechly’s versatility that makes him such a challenge for offenses to gameplan against.</p>\n<p>Supporting Kuechly and the rest of the linebacking core are the members of “Thieves Ave”— the Panthers’ secondary. Led by arguably the best defensive back in the NFL in Josh Norman, the crew is responsible for 15 of the team’s 24 interceptions with safety Kurt Coleman’s seven being tied for the most in the NFC.</p>\n<p>Although Peyton Manning has yet to throw an interception this postseason, the time shall come once he squares off against the Panthers’ defense. Carolina’s defense is predicated around the foundation of takeaways, having already recorded six interceptions and two fumbles in two playoff games.</p>\n<p>In addition to Manning throwing at least one interception in each of his three previous Super Bowl trips, there has been just one season in which Peyton has threw less than 10 interceptions.</p>\n<p>That lone season ended with a Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears with the Indianapolis Colts during the years of 2006-07. Certainly I’m not inferring that the Broncos can’t win because of this statistic, yet the Panthers’ ball hawing defense may be able to prey upon Peyton’s weakest element which could end with Carolina bringing home the Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of February 4, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67896\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67896\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/","id":1999,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1998,1997,1996],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ascends to No. 10 in National Rankings, Travel to No. 3 BYU for Back-to-Back Road Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-04-e1454484153942.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MVolleyballVS.CSUN-20160127-JennyLuo-04-e1454484153942.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite a 3-2 loss to No. 2 LBSU last Friday, the No. 10 UCSB men's volleyball team is determined to learn from its narrow five-set loss with hopes of moving up in the MPSF standings if it can prevail...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Following its loss in a five-set thriller to No. 2 Long Beach State last Friday, the No. 10 UCSB men’s volleyball team looks ahead to a pair of road games this weekend at No. 3 BYU. The Gauchos climbed a spot in the national rankings despite the loss as they now sit at 4-2 in MPSF play, 8-3 overall.</p>\n<p>The loss against the 49ers ended UCSB’s three-game winning streak. Awaiting Santa Barbara next is another prominent opponent in the Cougars.</p>\n<p>BYU is tied with the Gauchos for fourth place in the conference standings with a 4-2 record, 6-2 overall.

The libero has started in most of the team’s matches since the beginning of league play, but also splits time with his little brother, sophomore libero Hayden Boehle. The siblings combined for 13 digs in the Long Beach match.</p>\n<p>UCSB is heading on the road with strong confidence after its intense match against LBSU. Despite its inability to maintain its lead in the final set of the match, Santa Barbara knows it cannot allow the loss to linger as there will be opportunities to compete against the nation’s top teams throughout the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>Defeating the Cougars on the road will be no easy feat, considering the elevation of the school sits at 4,630 feet, significantly higher than the 46-foot elevation of UCSB’s campus. The thin Utah air poses a physical challenge that is difficult to prepare for.</p>\n<p>“Provo is the toughest place to play in our league and BYU is always ranked in the top three,” Head Coach Rick Mclaughlin said. “They have a real home court advantage, but coming off last Friday’s battle I think we’ll be ready to compete hard.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were well aware that they had a great chance to win the match against Long Beach State, and players were vocal that they made too many mistakes and gifted their opponents too many points.</p>\n<p>“We have to make fewer errors towards the end of games,” Parker Boehle said. That’s something we are working on going forward.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 26 hitting errors last Friday set a season-high, it was also the team’s first time with over 20 since the first week of the season. Additionally, the Gauchos made three errors –two hitting and one service —which occurred while Long Beach scored the last five points of the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are aiming to break away from the pack of 4-2 teams in the MPSF standings this week while playing at BYU, and the pair of road games are sure to provide a stern test for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces BYU this Friday, Feb. 5 at 7 p.m. at Smith Fieldhouse. The two teams play again on Saturday, Feb. 6 at the same time and location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67863\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67863\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-ascends-to-no-10-in-national-rankings-travel-to-no-3-byu-for-back-to-back-road-matches/","id":5060,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5059,5058,5057],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":88,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
