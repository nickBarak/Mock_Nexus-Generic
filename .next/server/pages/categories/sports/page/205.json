I love hitting people,” Hayden said. “Pretty much every time I come out for a cross I hit someone. I almost punched Boxall in the back of the head the other night. Box is the same way. He likes showing everyone where his territory is, and if you come in there with the ball he’ll make you pay.”</p>\n<p>Boxall was raised in Auckland, New Zealand, a country where most kids grow up with a different kind of ball in their hands.</p>\n<p>“I used to play rugby, but I switched to soccer when I was about 10 or 11,” Boxall said. “My high school was a big rugby school, kind of like how football is here. It gets all the attention. I’m glad I switched, it’s taken me to a bunch of places I would have never been able to go and I’m very thankful to be in Santa Barbara right now.”</p>\n<p>“Super” Sam is not exactly a California native either. He was born in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, then moved to Arizona to attend Yavapai College. There, Hayden won two consecutive NJCAA Goalkeeper of the Year awards to go along with the team’s pair of national championships. Not bad for a recruit touted as “too short,” at 5’10.”</p>\n<p>“What I saw was somebody with unbelievable athleticism, who was getting up and over everybody, and who had hands that were incredibly big and strong,” Head Coach Vom Steeg told UCSB Athletics in a story about Hayden’s recruitment process earlier this year. “I told Stu [Dobson, UCSB’s goalkeeper coach], ‘This kid is unbelievable,’ and he goes, ‘How big is he?’ When I said 5’10”, he told me to forget it.”</p>\n<p>Now that the two find themselves united by a common goal in UCSB’s backfield, they’ve become fast friends, joking with each other about their special relationship.</p>\n<p>“We have this joke with one of my friends that Boxall is my number one and she’s my number two,” Hayden said with a laugh. “She doesn’t really like that too much.”</p>\n<p>Despite Boxall’s 200-pound frame and Hayden’s affinity for throwing a punch or two in the box, they both insist the Gaucho defense is about a lot more than just starting fights with opposing teams.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we instigate it,” Boxall says. “With the players that we have like Chris [Hunter], Peter [McGlynn], [Michael] Tetteh and [James] Kiffe, we can basically take whatever they want to throw at us. All of us can handle the physical players, the fast speedy players, but we’re also skilled enough to handle the technically savvy players.”</p>\n<p>Those abilities will be put on the line tonight when Gaucho soccer hosts Denver in the NCAA tournament’s first round. The two teams have not met since 2001, though the Pioneers hosted Gaucho rival Cal Poly in a 1-0 early season loss. The classic sports cliché tells players to take a season one game at a time and never to look beyond an early opponent. But with the College Cup — soccer’s version of the Final Four — being held in Santa Barbara in December, it seems an easy piece of advice to ignore.</p>\n<p>“It’s in the back of our head, of course it is,” Hayden said. “It’s hard for it not to be. But we’re not going to get there if we don’t take care of [Denver]. It’s good motivation for us, but we have to take care of business in the games beforehand.”</p>\n<p>Hayden and Boxall, as leaders of the team, are poised to make a run at a national title. But to beat Denver, or any other team, the Gauchos will need more than just the two of them, and they are the first to say so.</p>\n<p>“Everyone on our squad works their asses off,” Boxall said. “You can tell when we just take over games in the second half. Other teams are just too fatigued. That’s a product of us working hard in the offseason, our coaches running us into the ground, and it seems to be paying its dividends now.”</p>\n<p>At this stage in the season, every team has injuries and every team feels the fatigue. For this pair of seniors playing out their final games in Gaucho blue, overcoming that exhaustion is more than just an objective: It’s a necessity.</p>\n<p>“Our goal, with the players that we have, is to go all the way,” Boxall said. “We’ve known that ever since we got knocked out by UCLA last year. That’s what we’ve been working toward for the last eight, nine months, and it’s definitely going to be a huge disappointment if we don’t.”</p>\n<p>Boxall, along with the rest of the squad, never talks about stats, only wins. Don’t expect that to change with a month left of tournament soccer against the nation’s best.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/","id":1701,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1700,1699,1698],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: It’s About More than Just Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Most owners would say a good fantasy day is any day you get to put another check mark in the win column.

On the surface, it was a very solid 90-80 win in which Hines Ward got me 19 points. But even then I could see the danger signs. Four of my players scored under 10 points, and my second and third top scorers were my defense and my kicker.</p>\n<p>When you rely on those positions to win games for you, you are essentially relying on luck and on your opponent’s negligence when it comes to setting his or her roster.</p>\n<p>As it happened, luck played a large role. My opponent’s defense got him -3 points after having performed fairly well in the weeks prior, and one of his running backs, LeSean McCoy, had an off day. So even though I got the win, I had little reason to be happy about my team’s performance.</p>\n<p>A week later I had another close win, this time 99-87, but the same problems plagued me. My three top scorers were BenJarvus Green-Ellis, who got me 24 points, Calvin Johnson, who got 28 points, and, for the second straight week, my kicker, Sebastian Janikowski, who got 15 points. Five of my nine players scored six points or fewer, and once again my win came down to luck that my opponent chose not to start Matthew Stafford, who got 24 points that day, opting instead to start Tom Brady, who got 13.</p>\n<p>The next week it became clear that my luck was up. My top three scorers got me 16, 11 and 10 points and the number two scorer was Janikowski once again. The rest of my players got me eight points or fewer, and the only reason I managed to scrape out a 60-50 win was because the only player on my opponent’s team who got him over seven points was his quarterback.</p>\n<p>And that brings us back to the point where my luck finally ran out. I knew it was going to happen eventually. I was not surprised to find that, after getting me a total of six points over the past two weeks, Hines Ward put up a goose egg, or that Larry Fitzgerald, who had one strong showing all season, only mustered 11 points against a decent Seahawks defense.</p>\n<p>I saw this loss coming based on the way I was getting my wins. I was riding the coattails of a few players while the rest of my team attempted to drag me down. A winning season is built on consistently strong performances from the entire team. Those days are good fantasy days, even if they result in a loss. A strong loss means you suffered from bad luck, and it is likely that you will rebound. A weak win, however, usually is the result of a weak team, and foreshadows losses.</p>\n<p>That is why a win does not always equal a good fantasy day. A good day is made from a strong team performance that does not appear to be a fluke. And if your team can’t give you that, you better hope luck is on your side.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: Matt Cassel, QB, Kansas City Chiefs. He’s available in 60 percent of leagues and is averaging 15 points over the last five games. However, the fantasy playoffs are coming up in a few weeks, and it’s time to start preparing. If you’re in and want to stock up or you’re right on the edge and need something to push you over, then instead of over-searching through a depleted waiver wire, make a trade with a team that is out of contention. It’s more likely that you’ll find what you need there.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg knows just how to judge a good fantasy day, if you know what I mean.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In the doubles A Flight, senior Taylor Chavez Goggin and junior Mathieu Forget flattened UCSD in an 8-2 rout in their first doubles match of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“That win was a good way to start off the tournament,” Chavez Goggin said. Matt and I both went 6-0 [in the tournament] and we were both serving well. It makes doubles so much easier when you’re used to your partner.”</p>\n<p>Senior Evan Jurgensen and freshman Axel Bouillin also won their doubles match for the day with a convincing 8-4 win in the B Flight, but the team of sophomore Max Glenn and junior Alex Johnson wasn’t as fortunate after losing  a 9-8 heartbreaker in the C Flight. UCSB’s only other loss of the day would come in singles play in the G Flight when Vincent Nguyen beat Bouillin in two sets, 7-6 and 6-4.</p>\n<p>In singles play, Forget and Chavez Goggin again led the charge. In his first match in the A Flight, Forget fell behind after losing the first set 4-6 to Erik Elliot, but then came roaring back to take the next two sets, both by a score of 6-2.</p>\n<p>“He just settled down,” Assistant Head Coach Blake Muller said. “The guy had a really good forehand so [Mathieu] just wore him down.”</p>\n<p>Chavez Goggin won his first match, which came against Chapman Chan, in two sets, 6-3 and 6-4, but the real gem on the day came from Jurgensen, who decimated Max Dutreix in a two set (6-2, 6-1) win in the C Flight.</p>\n<p>“He played well and he served well,” Muller said. “The guy struggled with the high forehand and Evan stayed up there.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on to win all nine of their matches on Saturday without losing a set, including Forget’s 6-0, 6-0 routing of LMU’s Daniel Simko in the A Flight.</p>\n<p>“I had a really good win on the first day and that really boosted my confidence,” Forget said. “I just played solid. I felt really good about myself. I played simple and relaxed.”</p>\n<p>Alex Johnson also managed to stand out on a day when all the Gauchos played outstanding matches. Facing Jack Zapala in the F Flight, Johnson came within two games of replicating Forget’s achievement as he won both of his sets 6-1.</p>\n<p>“I think Alex is still trying to get comfortable a little bit since it’s his first year at UCSB,” Muller said. “But he never let up and he never let the guy believe he had a chance.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara closed the tournament as it had opened it: by winning seven of their nine matches to bring their total up to 23 wins out of 27 possible for the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think our guys are all playing well,” Muller said. “They’ll come back ready to play after the break.

\r\n</script> \n<p>The pros get paid to compete in beautiful, exotic locations, sit in as esteemed members of ass-judging committees on their laydays, party with models, etc. and that’s awesome.</p>\n<p>But not everyone can live in the clouds of surfing stardom. For most other surfers, the ride is more challenging, more tiring, not as fast and not constantly filmed in HD by surf paparazzi. Rodeo flips and pro tournaments may be more than a little out of reach for myself and 99 percent of the rest of the surf world.</p>\n<p>People always say to me, “I wish I had started surfing earlier. It’s too late to start now,” or “I started too late, I won’t be able to become a good surfer.” Ugh. What pessimism. Don’t you unenlightened landlubbers get anything?</p>\n<p>Surfing is not about the babes, being able to boost air or getting a tanned bod. Surfing is not about the contests, the World Championship Tour or corporate sponsorship. It’s not even about Betzaida’s mouthwatering heiny.</p>\n<p>There’s real magic to the sport of kings. When you submerge yourself in surfing’s depth, waves become your spiritual fuel. The rhythmic bob of the tide is your pulse. Paddling is your breath, the spray of saltwater your speech.</p>\n<p>I’ve met people fifty years my senior who can surf with more skill, patience and style than myself. I’ve read accounts and seen videos of surfers in their 80s and 90s still going strong. They’re the inspired ones, the people I aspire to be. It’s not because they’ve become more used to balancing on their surfboard, more accurate at predicting waves or even more crafty at maneuvering the lineup, but because they’ve been able to keep the soul-buzzing feeling of the session in their lives even past their physical prime.</p>\n<p>There’s a certain delighted twinkle that manifests in the eyes of lifelong surfers. It’s almost an “I know something you don’t know” kind of jesting taunt. But when that soul surfer happens to talk about his or her experiences and smile — a smile that connects the whole mouth and eyes into a portrait of bubbly excitement — you begin to understand what a lifetime of soul adventure can do for one’s spirit.</p>\n<p>If you do it right, surfing will fulfill you, provide you purpose, bliss, satisfaction, exercise, community and challenge. The first step is entering the water with an open mind. The next step is to return to the water frequently. The final step is to stay positive and grateful to have at least a moment to float by yourself, with your buds or perhaps just the dolphins and fish.</p>\n<p>So don’t “what if” your surfing prospects. Don’t “I could’ve been a surfer had I started earlier”  yourself. Just give it a try, stay respectful and stay at it.</p>\n<p>Remember — it’s right there, and it’s good for you.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld was very disappointed with his second-place finish in the ass contest.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Her mother, Debbie Green, who played volleyball at USC, is a former Olympic silver medalist and the Long Beach State assistant coach of 23 years. At Long Beach, she coached her oldest daughter, Dana’s older sister Nicole, who was a setter as well. Additionally, Dana’s father Joseph Vargas is a former two-time Olympian for the USA water polo team.</p>\n<p>“Coming from a family like that, I was obviously influenced a lot,” Vargas said. “They really helped me take advantage of the opportunities I had in front of me, and I am very grateful.”</p>\n<p>“Dana has had a lot of pressure on her because of her family and their success in athletics,” Gregory said. “She was always expected to perform, and she has. She handles the pressure like a pro and is always focused.”</p>\n<p>Nicole, who plays volleyball professionally in France, is the root of much of the competitive spirit that Dana possesses. The two would battle endlessly, competing in everything from sports to  board games growing up.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of one time I beat my older sister in anything,” Vargas said. “Not in volleyball, any sports, or even Monopoly. Ever since I was little I have had a really competitive spirit and wanted to win everything, but for some reason, she would always beat me.”</p>\n<p>It is safe to say that Vargas feels right at home in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I love Santa Barbara,” Vargas said. “My teammates and coaches are awesome, the atmosphere is amazing, and the weather isn’t too bad either.”</p>\n<p>For a player whose career will be forever marked in Gaucho volleyball history, Vargas was dangerously close to committing to University of Miami over UCSB as a high school senior.</p>\n<p>“At first I didn’t even want to come on a visit but my mom forced me to,” Vargas confessed. “Kathy and I connected on a player-coach level and two days later I called [Kathy] to commit here. To this day I know that I made the best decision for me.”</p>\n<p>Vargas stormed onto campus, making an immediate impact in one of the most impressive freshman seasons in school history. The freshman setter played in all 52 matches and dished out 1,381 assists — good for ninth all time in a single season at UCSB. Vargas ranked fifth in the Big West with her 11.51 assists per set as her play earned her Big West All-Freshman team honors.</p>\n<p>“I recruited [Dana] to be the starter right away,” Gregory said. “I was not really surprised when she came in and played well right away. She is extremely talented and focused and I knew what she was capable of.”</p>\n<p>In her first ever match for the Gauchos, Vargas lived up to, if not exceeded, her coach’s expectations. She tallied 61 assists against San Diego State that game — one shy of her career-high set earlier this season against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“I remember that first match really well,” Vargas said. “Unfortunately we lost in five, which was a bummer, but that really boosted my confidence and showed that I belonged. It set the tone for the rest of my season.”</p>\n<p>Although Vargas played well individually, her first few seasons at UCSB did not go so well, with the team finishing below .500 in each of her first two seasons at Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Those first few seasons, we didn’t do very well as a team, and I took that kind of hard,” Vargas said. “I’m such a competitive person, so it got to me a little.”</p>\n<p>Vargas’ list of career accolades is not a short one. Last season as a junior, Vargas was named an American Volleyball Coaches Association All-American Honorable Mention and received First Team All-West Region and First Team All-Big West honors. Her 1,297 assists last year were also tops in the Big West and her average of 10.90 assists per set ranked her #2 in the Big West and 40th in the nation.</p>\n<p>Apart from the impressive statistics she continues to compile on the court, Vargas’ leadership is the key. For anyone watching a Gauchos volleyball game, it is clear that Vargas is the team captain. Always vocal and encouraging, Vargas is constantly pumping up her team, being a verbal leader on the court.</p>\n<p>“It has been a great experience to play with Dana,” senior outside hitter Charlene DeHoog said. “I have watched her grow and mature as a player and grow as a person these past four years. She is a natural born leader and has so much confidence on the court.”</p>\n<p>Another noticeable characteristic of Vargas is her passion. Self-described as feisty, Vargas more than makes up for her lack of size at 5’7” with her intensity.</p>\n<p>“I love her aggressive personality,” Gregory said. “Her leadership and passion make the whole team better. She always plays her hardest and is always in control, which is important for a setter and team leader.”</p>\n<p>After graduating in the spring with a degree in sociology and a minor in history, Vargas plans to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and go to Europe to play professionally.</p>\n<p>“Dana is an awesome person,” DeHoog said. “She will succeed in life because she is so reliable and such a great leader.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will close out its 2010 campaign on the road this weekend at UC Riverside. For Vargas, it will be her final match in a Gaucho uniform, the culmination of four years of hard work for Vargas.</p>\n<p>“My experience here has been amazing,” Vargas said. “Kathy is one of the few coaches who truly cares about each of her players and what happens to them after college. I am so fortunate, and UCSB and the athletic program have been so amazing to my team and me. They have made my experience something to remember.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29938\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29938\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/","id":2893,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2892,2891,2890],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: Musings from the NFL’s Week 10","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"From a great NFL season that just keeps giving and giving, here are a few observations from last week:","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>From a great NFL season that just keeps giving and giving, here are a few observations from last week:</p>\n<p>Brett Favre</p>\n<p>The 41-year-old followed up last week’s personal career best passing performance (446 yards) with a blunder at Chicago.

Pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>Troy Smith</p>\n<p>Just to satisfy all you 49er fans, here is the part where I write a couple of sentences about how good Troy Smith looked on Sunday. About how, as opposed to a certain other SF QB with the same last name, he actually looked like he was trying. How he brought a confidence and swagger to the offense, especially at the end of the game. How he threw for 356 yards — something Alex Smith failed to do for the Niners in 50 games as starter. Now Smith (Troy, that is) should be the starter going forward.</p>\n<p>And finally, here is the part where to the pleasure of Niner fans, I say that San Francisco — who is only two games behind first place Seattle — can take the NFC West this year, in which pathetically no team in the division has a positive point differential at the moment.</p>\n<p>Michael Vick</p>\n<p>Vick looked unbelievable Monday night. In a 59-28 crushing of the Redskins, he became the first player in the NFL with 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards, four passing TDs and two rushing TDs. Wow. He is 4-0 as a starter this year, and if he continues this play, he may win the MVP.</p>\n<p>The Unpredictability Continues</p>\n<p>The New York Giants entered Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys with a 6-2 record. They possessed the NFC’s top-ranked offense and defense and were riding a five-game winning streak (including a win over Dallas). The Cowboys were 1-7 and seemingly in turmoil, yet dominated the Giants from the onset of the game to win 33-20 in Head Coach Jason Garrett.</p>\n<p>The previously 2-6 Denver Broncos beat the Kansas City Chiefs handily on Sunday, a team that was 5-3 and boasted the league’s top rushing offense.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Denver’s early domination (they were up 21-0 in the first quarter), Chiefs QB Matt Cassel ended up with a monster fantasy day, passing for 469 yards and four touchdowns. Two touchdowns and 186 yards of which belonged to WR Dwayne Bowe, including a beautifully wrapped gift (for which this fantasy owner is extremely grateful for) in the form of a garbage TD with 10 seconds left with KC down by 26.</p>\n<p>Attempting to figure the league out this year is tough, but here are my top five teams right now:</p>\n<p>1.) Patriots (7-2): They just beat down the Steelers and showed why coaching is so important in the NFL — Belichick never loses two in a row.</p>\n<p>2.) Falcons (7-2): I believe in Matt Ryan. And Roddy White. For fantasy purposes, too.</p>\n<p>3.) Saints (6-3): They get Reggie Bush back, and aren’t they still the defending champs?</p>\n<p>5.) Eagles (6-3): With a larger sample size with Vick as quarterback, they could be even higher.</p>\n<p>4.) Jets (7-2): They are 7-2, and although he is inconsistent, Mark Sanchez finds a way to win close games (two in a row on the road in OT).</p>\n<p>Now, in the words of Jim Rome: I am out!</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush will be representing Daily Nexus Sports at the ESPYs in the category of best Jim Rome impression.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29950\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29950\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/","id":2896,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2895,2894,2893],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kevin Love: You’re Awesome and Here’s Why","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For the uninitiated, Kevin Love is one of the best players in the NBA.

There, I said it. The former UCLA star has blown past racial and body-type expectations to drop the first 30-30 game since Moses Malone’s more than 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Some may say that his 30-30 came against the hurry-up Knicks — a team about as renowned for its strong rebounding as Shaq is for showing up to camp in shape — but he still put up 23-24 against my hometown Lakers.</p>\n<p>Although Love is far and away the best Timberwolf, the begoggled Kurt Rambis seems to be unable to see past what Love can’t do. Sure he’s not the ideal size for the four and quicker power forwards will eat him for lunch, but the boy can play. Pure and simple.</p>\n<p>Bad teams obsess about what their stars can’t do. We saw it in Memphis when they shipped the still-young Pau Gasol to LA for Javaris Crittenton, Kwame Brown and the rights to his younger brother, and we even saw it in Minnesota earlier this year when they swapped Al Jefferson to Utah for Kosta Koufous. For Memphis, the deal worked out in a way —Marc proved to be a borderline All-Star at the five and they shipped away Agent Zero so that he could try to exercise his (pretend) license to kill in DC — but Pau’s presence in LA sent the Lakers to three straight Finals and inspired a nation to wonder if Chris Wallace was taking revenge on his former employers.</p>\n<p>For every well-run team in the league, the top priority is discerning the strengths of their stars and filling the rest of the team with players to compliment that strength. The Heat are the obvious exception to this rule — they decided to go and get the best player in the league to compliment their star — but for positive evidence of this working right away, look no further than the Magic.</p>\n<p>Their best player, Dwight Howard, is worthless on offense if the opposing big is his size. He can’t shoot worth a lick and his free throw percentage is in Shaq-ian territory. Some teams would wail and moan about why their star can’t step out to the three-point line to turn around a foundering offense,­­ but Otis Smith coolly stocked the rest of the team with lights-out shooters (ridiculously overpaying Rashard Lewis in the process) that turn Howard’s weaknesses into team-wide strengths.</p>\n<p>Love isn’t quite the defensive force that Howard is, but might be an even better rebounder and is a better outlet passer, with a decent outside shot to boot. A smart team would plug him into a system with a speedy point guard, a few athletic wings and a leaper opposite him at center to deal with the shots that Love is too ground-bound to contest. Kahn has made nods toward those things — he drafted three point guards a year ago to go with the three small forwards he picked up this year — but seems intent on saddling Love with a coach that either doesn’t know or doesn’t care that the front office spent the summer shipping away the team’s former star (the unbelievably underrated Al Jefferson) so that Love could finally have the spotlight to shine. And don’t even get me started on Michael Beasley. He’s a power forward, Kurt. Play him there.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Artsweek editor <em>Michael Hafford wishes he could find someone that could complement his strengths and weaknesses.

The fourth-seeded Titans took care of that problem with a 2-1 upset win at Irvine last week. That victory handed the Gauchos the luxury of playing at their home field on Saturday, where they outhustled Fullerton for 90 minutes in a match that was never close.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’m very excited for our players tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We’ve been 0-2 [in the conference tournament finals], so to finally get that game and enjoy it with our fans — that was great.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck early and often, tallying a pair of first half goals. Junior midfielder Danny Barrera took a ball from sophomore Nic Ryan in the 19th minute, slipping it past Fullerton’s keeper low and left to put UCSB on the board first, 1-0. Just three minutes later, junior midfielder Luis Silva would add the eventual game winner with an unassisted goal off his own deflected corner to put his team up by two, sending the 4,613 spectators in attendance into a frenzy.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to take it last year, but unfortunately we didn’t,” Silva said. “We had another chance last night and we did what we had to do. It feels good, but I couldn’t have done it without the team. It’s a group thing; I’m glad we did it together.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s goal, coupled with three shots on goal and four overall, earned him Big West Tournament MVP honors, but Silva’s red-hot foot was all part of a Gaucho trend that has been building all season long. Vom Steeg’s team has outshot its opponent in every match this season, culminating in 15 shots on goal on Saturday which ties a season-high.</p>\n<p>Fullerton, on the other hand, put up just eight shots overall. Its only goal came in the 27th minute, when midfielder Kevin Venegas bent in a cross, which defender Jesse Escalante headed past the outstretched arms of UCSB’s senior goalkeeper Sam Hayden.</p>\n<p>One common theme throughout the match was its physical nature. Eight yellow cards were handed out over the course of the match, with each team receiving four. Outside of the cards, Saturday’s match was full of pushes and shoves on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that Fullerton needed to win that game to make it to the tournament,” Vom Steeg said. “Anytime you’re playing a team and it could be their last game, you’re going to get everything. That’s the way it’s going to be all the way out.”</p>\n<p>Boxall, who stands at 6’2” and weighs 200 pounds, has seen and given his fair share of elbows this season, with last night being no exception.</p>\n<p>“I love it when it gets physical; that’s the way I play,” Boxall said. “I’ve yet to come across someone who can out-physical me. If they like to play that way, it’s playing into our hands and to our strengths.”</p>\n<p>With the win, the Gauchos earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, which begins on Nov. 18. Though UCSB would likely have received a spot in the 48-team tournament regardless of Saturday’s result, the win improves the team’s chances for an early-round home game. Gaucho players and coaches will discover their fate today, when the tournament selection takes place on ESPNU.</p>\n<p>These Gauchos are a very different team from the ones who took the field in September, coming out of the gates with a 0-2-2 record before rattling off 13 wins in its last 16 games to close out the season at 13-4-3 overall. Now, their focus shifts forward</p>\n<p>“Like I said from the beginning, I like this group,” Vom Steeg said. “All we know is our name is going to come up [on Monday’s selection show]. That’s all you can really do at this stage, is see who we’re going to play. Hopefully, we’ll get a home game, and we’ll go from there.”</p>\n<p>For a team that is preparing for its ninth-consecutive NCAA tournament appearance, Saturday’s win was little more than a warm-up for the real goal: another national title.</p>\n<p>“[The win over Fullerton] gives us a little boost, but we can’t get too confident, because we don’t know who we’re going play next or their style,” Silva said. “It’s playoffs now and we have to take it one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>Monday’s selection show begins at 1:30 p.m. when the team will host a viewing party in the Intercollegiate Athletics Building to find out who will be its first-round opponent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/","id":1712,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1711,1710,1709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Split All but Ends Gaucho Postseason Hopes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team split its final two home games of the year this weekend, beating UC Davis 3-2 before losing to Pacific by the same margin.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team split its final two home games of the year this weekend, beating UC Davis 3-2 before losing to Pacific by the same margin.</p>\n<p>“We obviously would have liked to come away with two wins this weekend,” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “Both matches were hard fought and we were in a position to win both, but just couldn’t quite get it done.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos (15-13 overall, 9-6 Big West) took the first and the third sets from Pacific both by scores of 25-23.

Freshman outside hitter added 10 kills and 15 digs, and junior libero Chelsey Lowe had a career-high 30 digs.</p>\n<p>On Friday against UC Davis, Santa Barbara found itself on the other side of a five-game match. UCSB struggled early in the contest, dropping the first two sets to enter the locker room with a 2-0 deficit.</p>\n<p>“In the locker room, I told them we have a chance to do the same thing they did to us,” Gregory said. “We focused on one game at a time and once we started playing a little harder and with a little more passion behind our home crowd, we were able to pull off a great comeback.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing the battle on the stat sheet (UCSB had 65 digs to Davis’ 96 and hit .223 to Davis’ .268), the Gauchos were able to persevere and complete the comeback with timely hitting and effort.</p>\n<p>“[Davis’] defensive performance was simply unbelievable,” Gregory said. “It was a hard fought game throughout, and we stepped up in big spots when we needed to and found a way to win. I’m proud of our team.”</p>\n<p>In tight fourth set that featured 19 tied scores and 12 lead changes, the Gauchos fed off the home crowd. Battling into extra sets, the Thunderdome was loud and UCSB took the set 29-27.</p>\n<p>Entering the fifth set with all the momentum behind them, the Gauchos could do no wrong. Holding Davis to a .174 hitting percentage, UCSB completed the comeback by taking the final frame 15-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos remain in fourth place in their conference and all but out of the NCAA playoff picture. They close out their 2010 regular season campaign on the road at UC Riverside next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/weekend-split-ends-gaucho-postseason-hopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/weekend-split-ends-gaucho-postseason-hopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/weekend-split-ends-gaucho-postseason-hopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/weekend-split-ends-gaucho-postseason-hopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/weekend-split-ends-gaucho-postseason-hopes/","id":5511,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[5510,5509,5508],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCLA Returns From Deficit to Give Gauchos Fifth Consecutive Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite holding the lead for much of the game, the #7 UCSB men’s water polo team lost to #4 UCLA 9-8 at the UCSB Campus Pool.\r\n\r\n“We came and matched them exactly evenly and we put ourselves in a ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite holding the lead for much of the game, the #7 UCSB men’s water polo team lost to #4 UCLA 9-8 at the UCSB Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>“We came and matched them exactly evenly and we put ourselves in a position to win,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We just didn’t execute at the very end of the game.

They’re a serious team, so I knew it wasn’t going to be an easy game.” UCLA Head Coach Adam Wright said. “We needed to make some stops throughout the end and we were able to.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Bruins battled throughout the game with neither team leading by more than a two score advantage at any point. UCSB started the game aggressively, scoring on the opening possession via a bounced shot by freshman 2M Lazar Komadinic. UCLA responded quickly with a goal of its own when senior center Jacob Murphy backhanded one into the left side of the net from near the 2m line.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, UCSB senior utility player Milos Golic scored three goals and fellow senior Zsombor Vincze scored one, giving the Gauchos a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Though the second half was primarily a defensive affair, the intensity increased in the fourth quarter when UCLA tied the game up 7-7 early into the period. A few minutes later, UCSB’s Vincze scored off of a shot deflected by the UCLA goalie. UCLA tied the game up once again though when utility player Josh Samuels rebounded a missed shot and scored for the 8-8 tie.</p>\n<p>Less than a minute later, UCLA’s physical style of play paid off once again when Murphy netted the game-deciding goal from around the 2 meter line. UCSB’s Golic and Gronow attempted to equalize it and force overtime, but UCLA managed to stop the Gauchos on consecutive possessions to close out the match.</p>\n<p>“We need a little more intensity and motivation in the last two minutes. It seemed like throughout the game that we can win the game.” Golic said. “We had the lead almost three quarters. I think people were really scared, we didn’t have that motivation in the last moment to pull it out.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, the Gauchos had difficulty stopping UCLA from getting the ball inside and exploiting its opportunities near the net. The game winning goal was the third of the day for UCLA’s Murphy and his second from near the 2 meter line, where UCSB  allowed four of UCLA’s nine goals.</p>\n<p>“We have trouble with that against other teams too, I think that’s a thing that we need to be improved for the coming [conference] tournament.” Golic said. “That’s basically where everything’s going to be determined. “If we play this way with a little more velocity, I think we can pass the first round [of the tournament].”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will finish off its regular season on Nov. 20 against Pepperdine University at Campus Pool. Both teams are tied for seventh place in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>“[It’s] very disappointing to lose a game like this at home, but at the same time we’re playing well and we’re going to try to take that momentum into the conference tournament.” Wigo said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/","id":5245,"author":{"id":307,"name":"David Washington"},"related":[5244,5243,5242],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Drops Two on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s basketball opened the regular season with a pair of losses this weekend at Pepperdine and #15 UCLA, losing 68-56 to the Waves on Friday and 66-52  to the Bruins on Sunday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s basketball opened the regular season with a pair of losses this weekend at Pepperdine and #15 UCLA, losing 68-56 to the Waves on Friday and 66-52  to the Bruins on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We can take a lot from this weekend and learn from it,” junior guard Emilie Johnson said. “I feel like we played well enough against Pepperdine that we should have won.

We have good guard play to control the ball so we need that to be key to score more and not turn the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Johnson led the Gauchos in points and assists with 14 and four, but she also committed a team high six turnovers. Sophomore guard Sweets Underwood added nine points for the Gauchos, while senior center Mekia Valentine was held in check with two points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We put those turnovers on ourselves,” Johnson said. “UCLA put good pressure on us, but we made passes that we don’t normally do. We need to take better care of the ball. We need to get better in our next game. Turnovers and mistakes are what can happen when playing UCLA.”</p>\n<p>UCLA shot an efficient 43.8 percent on field goals, but only 12.5 from the three-point line. UCSB on the other hand shot 37.7 percent from the field and 25 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“I think in spurts we really competed with them,” Gottlieb said. “We showed we can play at this level. I feel UCLA is a legitimate top 15 team and they were a tough opponent. We just need to sustain the play for 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Friday night’s game against Pepperdine proved to be a challenge for UCSB as well. After trailing by only three at half time, the Gauchos failed to stick with the Waves, being outscored 37-28 in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We have to get tougher, mentally and physically,” Johnson said. “We have to have a mentality of getting it done. What is important is being fighters and getting it done on offense and defense.”</p>\n<p>Adrian nearly had a double double against Pepperdine with 11 points and nine rebounds. Johnson led UCSB with 15 points making seven of 14 shots, but only one of five from behind the three point line. Valentine added three points and seven rebounds, and freshman guard Melissa Zornig added nine points for the Gauchos, as well as leading the team with three assists.</p>\n<p>“Collectively we need to be tougher. We need to sustain our team intensity for 40 minutes and be the aggressors and make the other teams respond to us and our play,” Gottlieb said. “Our goal is to be a complete team. If facing pressure we need to break the press, if they put two defenders down low on Mekia we need to be able to pass it out to the perimeter and knock down shots. Overall, we need to be a complete team on offense.

Jarrod Stigall led the team with eight goals, good for second in the conference. Stigall also added eight assists to lead the Pioneers to a 6-2-2 conference record.</p>\n<p>Though the Gauchos have not seen Denver since a 2001 1-0 loss, there is a connection between the two teams. Sophomore forward Sam Garza, UCSB’s goals leader with nine, transferred from Denver at the beginning of the 2009 season. With the Pioneers, Garza scored four goals and was picked as MPSF Newcomer of the Year and was a Second Team All-MPSF selected.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited,” Garza said. “When I first saw it my stomach dropped and I was like, ‘no way,’ but it just had to happen. They’re a good team. I still know all the guys, so it’ll be fun to face them again.”</p>\n<p>The winner of the match will head north to face UC Berkeley — which has a first-round bye — in the second round of the NCAA tournament on Saturday. Other seeded teams in UCSB’s portion of the 48-team bracket include #3 Akron, #11 Connecticut and #14 Indiana.</p>\n<p>“It won’t be an easy game by any means,” Garza said. “But if we just play our game, we’re capable of beating any team in the country.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/mens-soccer-host-denver/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/mens-soccer-host-denver/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/mens-soccer-host-denver/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/mens-soccer-host-denver/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/mens-soccer-host-denver/","id":1714,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1713,1712,1711],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":205,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
