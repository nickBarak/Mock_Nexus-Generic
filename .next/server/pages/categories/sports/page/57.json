The Nittany Lions have won eight of their last 10 matches.</p>\n<p>Those two games in Hawaii, just like most of their road games, didn’t go so well for the Gauchos, but there’s a decent chance Friday’s game will be different. UCSB’s one road win this season came against UCSD, who are just outside the top 15 in the NCAA men’s volleyball ranking.</p>\n<p>All those road losses, on the other hand, came against teams ranked above the Gauchos. The good news for UCSB, then, is that Penn State is one spot below the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Still, of course, simple rankings aren’t going to determine Friday’s game. If UCSB wants to notch its second road win in a row, the team is going to have to keep up the consistency established in its last two games, despite including its five-set loss to UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Friday’s road win over the Tritons was a dominant straight set, little sweat performance that snapped the Gauchos’ seven-game losing streak. Saturday’s effort against now-No. 6 UC Irvine was less successful, as the Anteaters pulled out a 3-2 win, but it was no less an impressive effort.</p>\n<p>UCSB hit at a solid .313 clip, and red shirt senior star hitter Jacob Delson had a career-high 34 kills in the loss, which went to extra points in the decisive fifth set.</p>\n<p>The Nittany Lions are gradually building momentum as they have won their last two matches. It should be noted, however, that none of those games were against ranked teams. Friday’s matchup, then, will be a chance for Penn State to prove itself against a ranked team for the first time since their loss to Ohio State in late January.</p>\n<p>Rather than rely on just one hitter to power the attack, Penn State has counted on three main players to rack up the kills: redshirt freshman opposite Calvin Mende, redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lee Smith and senior outside hitter Chris Nugent.</p>\n<p>Mende leads the trio with 179 kills, but Nugent’s 3.50 kills per set is tops on the team and 23rd in the nation.</p>\n<p>Assists, on the other hand, have been a more unimodal production. Redshirt freshman Luke Braswell has 593 assists, far more than any other Nittany Lion, including a 63-assist effort against USC.</p>\n<p>Serves have been a major point of emphasis for UCSB this season, and success in that department was a major driving force in the Gauchos’ strong performances against UCSD and Irvine. More of that would be a big help on Friday night, especially in such a foreign environment.</p>\n<p>Just service success won’t be enough for UCSB to grab its first win against a ranked opponent this year. Another dominant showing by Delson, who had a double-double in kills and digs against UCSD, will likely be necessary, as well as big complementary games from hitters like sophomore outside hitter Corey Chavers and freshman middle blocker Keenan Sanders.</p>\n<p>Only a couple hours after they wrap up against Penn State, the Gauchos will have to shift gears to take on Division-II Lees-McRae College on Saturday afternoon at University Park. The Bobcats are 5-10 on the season and 3-7 in Conference Carolinas play.</p>\n<p>Lees-McRae will itself be coming off of a challenging match against eighth-ranked Stanford. Senior outside hitter John Sobel will be the frontman in the Bobcats’ upset attempts, as he leads his team with 187 kills this season on a 3.34 kills-per-set ratio.</p>\n<p>Freshman setter Reto Pfund has had the assist on almost every single one of those 187 kills and has posted 549 assists, good for 9.80 a set, this season.</p>\n<p>The Bobcats don’t look like too much of a challenge for the Gauchos on paper, but as every coach in America would say, games aren’t played on paper. Coming right on the heels of the Penn State match and taking place across the country, this match has all the makings of a trap game if UCSB isn’t careful.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Penn State on Friday, March 3, in University Park at 4:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76181\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/gauchos-on-road-at-penn-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76181\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/gauchos-on-road-at-penn-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/gauchos-on-road-at-penn-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/gauchos-on-road-at-penn-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/gauchos-on-road-at-penn-state/","id":4977,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4976,4975,4974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Battling For Big West Tournament Seeding","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C636&ssl=1","description":"The month of March is finally upon us, nearly guaranteeing some of the best college basketball all season.

A loss would land the Gauchos as the No. 6 seed.</p>\n<p>If the aforementioned scenario occurs, although UC Riverside would have a better overall record than UCSB, the Gauchos would receive the No. 4 seed because of having the best win-loss record in conference games against common opponents beginning at the top of the standings, according to the Big West Tournament Regulations rulebook.</p>\n<p>In this case, Santa Barbara would earn the fourth seed and a first-round bye because of its win over current No. 2 seed Long Beach State earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>Just one game ahead of last place Cal State Fullerton with a 4-24 and 2-12 conference record, UC Irvine is on the verge of clinching the No. 8 seed for the third-straight year in the hopes of squeezing into the Big West tournament. Meanwhile, Cal Poly sits a game behind UCSB in sixth place at 10-16, 6-8 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB will enter Thursday looking to extend its four-game winning streak against UC Irvine. The Gauchos have a chance to win the season series over UC Irvine in back-to-back seasons.</p>\n<p>Dating back to when the two programs first faced each other on Jan. 28, UCSB recorded a program-high 15 made three-pointers and finished with season highs in points (85), field goal percentage (55.4) and win differential (25 points), all while tying its best three-point percentage (50).</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ three-point barrage was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. She finished with career highs of 22 points and seven made three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Since setting the new record, UCSB had struggled from beyond the arc, but seems to be getting back on track as it has shot over 30 percent from deep in two of its last three games in which it has made at least seven threes.</p>\n<p>While Thursday could potentially be the game to reignite the Gauchos’ perimeter shot, it is also an opportunity for them to improve upon their ball movement and pace on offense.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara tallied a season-high 23 assists in its win over UC Irvine. The success from three-point land may have led to UCSB becoming too comfortable from deep as its sharing of the ball decreased.</p>\n<p>In four of seven games, UCSB has recorded 20-plus three-point attempts and has had less than 20 assists in all seven contests.</p>\n<p>Despite the statistics showing a decline, the Gauchos still own one of the best passing backcourts in the conference. Both point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler rank top five in total assists in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>Toler leads all players with 118, while Jemerigbe is fifth with 103. Both remain in the top five in assists per game as well with Toler in third with a 4.4 average and Jemerigbe with a 3.8 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>Success from behind the three-point line is influential on both sides as UC Irvine has become one of the top long-range shooting teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off setting a program high of 15 made three pointers in their loss to Long Beach State on Saturday. Senior guard Irene Chavez and sophomore guard Andee Ritter combined for 41 points and were responsible for 12 of the team’s three-pointers. Both knocked down six trey balls, marking a career high for Chavez.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Ritter has made strides all season long as she currently leads the Big West in total threes and steals at 79 and 62, respectively. She is the only Anteater ever to make at least 70 three-pointers in a season.</p>\n<p>UCI holds a Big West-leading 38.2 three-point percentage through conference play and is second in made three pointers with 107.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the Cal Poly matchup, Saturday has the potential to be very intense as the two could be battling it out for a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will be in search of repeating last season’s series sweep after defeating the Gauchos 78-67 on the conference’s opening day.</p>\n<p>Currently on a two-game losing streak, Cal Poly is led by junior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who is the team’s leading scorer at 15 points per game, good for fifth in the Big West. She has tallied 20-plus points in three consecutive games and four of the Mustangs’ last five contests.</p>\n<p>Earning a season-high 29 points against UCSB earlier this season, Leaupepe will be the center of attention for the Gauchos’ defense as she has attempted a combined 48 shots in the team’s last two games.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s promising start diminished as the season progressed, it still has a chance to end the season with a first-round bye for the first time since the 2010-11 season.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UC Irvine will be Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m. Santa Barbara will face Cal Poly on Saturday, March 4 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/","id":504,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[503,502,501],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts LMU, Oregon Aiming To Avenge Road Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-8-16_3-web-e1488351272184.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-8-16_3-web-e1488351272184.jpg?resize=500%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After suffering a heartbreaking loss at No. 6 Cal, the Gauchos return home hoping to pick up two victories.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team’s regular season continues with a short turnaround this week as Santa Barbara will host Loyola Marymount this Saturday, followed by No. 24 Oregon on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Heading into this weekend, UCSB is coming off a noteworthy doubleheader weekend.

The remarkable No. 1 doubles slot of junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays are now en route to a top-10 ranking as they remain undefeated.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ singles play dominance has remained consistent, and senior Teague Hamilton earned his first doubles/singles start last weekend.</p>\n<p>The team will surely appreciate that seven out of eight of their matches during the month of March will be held in Santa Barbara, granting the Gauchos some much needed rest from traveling on the road as well as home-court advantage.</p>\n<p>This Saturday, they will face off against Loyola Marymount University. The Lions are coming off a 5-2 home victory over the University of Arizona.</p>\n<p>After a delay that postponed the meet for a couple of hours, LMU started the meet off very strong by sweeping the entire doubles portion of the competition; thanks to a 6-3 finish by Max Kaiser &amp; Nick Borchenko, and a 6-2 for Ryan Brown &amp; Luke Bohuslav. The singles portion was just as much in favor of the Lions.</p>\n<p>After a tough three-set match, Kaiser’s 6-3 / 2-6 / 7-5 outcome earned his team the final win necessary for the sweep, ending the day with a win. LMU will host UC Davis this Thursday before heading over to Santa Barbara for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Oregon will enter Sunday with the momentum of its two-match winning streak and will be in search of its first road win this season. The Ducks remain undefeated at home after last Sunday’s 7-0 sweep over No. 42 Drake University.</p>\n<p>Oregon began the day by claiming the doubles advantage point for the ninth-straight meet thanks to its top court of senior Jayson Amos/sophomore Armando Soemarno, and No. 2 juniors Akihiro Tanaka/Simon Stevens. Oregon’s singles play went just as, if not more, smoothly with a clean sweep.</p>\n<p>Worth mentioning would be the talent of sophomore Thomas Laurent who recently earned his 15th straight singles victory, placing him tied for first as the biggest streak in Oregon’s history.</p>\n<p>Altogether, UCSB will have to be on their A-game, considering they’ll have to work with this short week. Consistency is important entering this doubleheader, and it seems that taking the early doubles advantage point has frequently done the Gauchos justice.</p>\n<p>Key matchups include the Gauchos’ singles consistency over Loyola Marymount and whether or not they can halt an on-fire University of Oregon doubles program.</p>\n<p>UCSB men’s tennis will host the first of its home series meets this Saturday, March 4, against Loyola Marymount University at 1 p.m., then again on Sunday, March 5, versus the University of Oregon at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-hosts-lmu-oregon-aiming-to-avenge-road-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-hosts-lmu-oregon-aiming-to-avenge-road-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-hosts-lmu-oregon-aiming-to-avenge-road-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-hosts-lmu-oregon-aiming-to-avenge-road-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-hosts-lmu-oregon-aiming-to-avenge-road-loss/","id":1135,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1134,1133,1132],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look To Impress Home Crowd This Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-04-at-1.46.10-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-04-at-1.46.10-PM.png?resize=892%2C583&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Gauchos will be playing the University of New Mexico Lobos on Sunday, March 5.

UCSB was able to beat out some tough opponents with the help of a great team effort and persistence that allowed the squad to pull out victories in close matches. However, UC Santa Barbara saw the end of their four-game winning streak the following weekend when they traveled further up north to play the University of Oregon Ducks and Washington Huskies.

New Mexico will surely have to be able to finish strong if given the opportunity to become victorious when they play the Gauchos on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have the perfect opportunity to right the ship against this struggling New Mexico team and, given the matchups, UCSB should be confident when they go to the courts this weekend.</p>\n<p>With the lack of success in doubles play for the Lobos, UCSB’s nationally ranked tandems of No. 44 senior Melissa Baker/sophomore Stephanie Yamada and No. 52 junior Palina Dubavets/senior Stefani Stojic should be able to finally clinch the doubles point after being unable to do so in UC Santa Barbara’s last two games.</p>\n<p>The game against UNM should also be an opportunity for the Gauchos to gain a rhythm back as Dubavets and senior Jaimee Gilbertson have been the only players to win in singles play over the course of last weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s return back home and meet against a favorable opponent should be enjoyed as the upcoming schedule after Sunday’s game is not looking too good for UCSB because they are scheduled to play four games from March 9-12.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos game against the University of New Mexico Lobos is scheduled to start Sunday, March 5, at 9:30 a.m. PST.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-look-to-impress-home-crowd-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-look-to-impress-home-crowd-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-look-to-impress-home-crowd-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-look-to-impress-home-crowd-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-look-to-impress-home-crowd-this-weekend/","id":1136,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1135,1134,1133],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tales Of The Tearing: Knees Beware","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ACL.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ACL.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"ACL and other knee related injuries have hindered the careers of various athletes.

What precautionary measures should be taken to avoid this setback and stay on a healthy path?</p>\n<p>Simply put, these are some crucial questions that unfortunately have no set answer. As a victim of this physical injury myself, I can honestly say the nature of an ACL tear is unpredictable. Much like what makes sports today so exciting, these unexpected moments of thrill and sorrow come and go as they please, keeping fans on the edge of their seats for the better but sometimes for the worse.</p>\n<p>Injuries are never a favorable circumstance for any athlete, but lessons can be learned in the process of this hardship and illuminate the true value of sports that lie beyond any court or hardwood floor.</p>\n<p>The first message would be to trust the process. A term coined after Philadelphia 76er Joel Embiid, an athlete’s journey is filled with unexpected trials and tribulations. Similar to the seven-footer’s process of being a high lottery pick in the NBA and then subsequently being sidelined for a season-ending surgery, our highest goals and ambitions can often be deterred by reality, but that doesn’t mean it has to stop there. In the lead for Rookie of the Year and averaging 29.6 points per game per 36 minutes, this guy is living proof that one can bounce back from a season-ending injury. It takes belief and confidence to know that one’s situation does not dictate the future road ahead.  Embiid’s will to work past his setback — much like other players who have sustained ACL injuries — has fueled his placement in the NBA and stake as one of the best young big men. All it takes is trusting the process.</p>\n<p>In the lead for Rookie of the Year and averaging 29.6 points per game per 36 minutes, this guy is living proof that one can bounce back from a season-ending injury.

There will be highs, lows and even lower periods where you feel that your injury has taken you to the end of the road.</p>\n<p>Former first overall pick Derrick Rose can attest to this, suffering not only an ACL tear but also a meniscus tear during the peak of his career.  While a major blow to one of the most explosive guards of our time, the Chicago native stuck through it and continues to follow his passion to this day: playing basketball. Rose continues to prove doubters wrong and show flashes of the athletic D-Rose, now in a New York Knick uniform.</p>\n<p>Whether professional or recreational, there is something common athletes like ourselves can take out of the career of Rose and other recipients of the ACL scare.</p>\n<p>Being on the road is never easy when it comes to sports. There will be setbacks, both physical and emotional, that continue to test one’s character. The ability to come to terms with this and understand that everyone has their own struggles and is in the process of conquering them is a bond that moves beyond the confines of gamesmanship. Trust the experience, trust the process and certainly trust the ride.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76102\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76102\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/tales-of-the-tearing-knees-beware/","id":1900,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1899,1898,1897],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"L.A.

The 6’7” goaltender was sent along with a fifth-round pick in the 2017 draft in exchange for Erik Cernak, a defensive prospect groomed by the Kings, a seventh-round pick, a conditional pick and goaltender “St.” Peter Budaj.</p>\n<p>The move completes St. Peter’s martyrdom after he essentially saved the season for the Kings when Jonathan Quick went down with a groin injury in the season opener against the Sharks. (However, “saved” may be too complimentary a term as the Kings now sit three games behind the St. Louis Blues for the second wild card spot in the West.)</p>\n<p>Many have wondered why the Kings, one day after Quick returned from his long-term injury, would move for a second elite goaltender in Bishop and renounce any loyalty at the expense of Budaj.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First off, Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi is no stranger to making blockbuster deals at the deadline (March 1). In 2012, Lombardi traded defenseman Jack Johnson to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Jeff Carter, who is currently the second leading goal scorer in the NHL.</p>\n<p>Carter proved to be an integral part of the team in their championship run later that year and has since molded himself into a team leader. In 2014 the Kings moved for Marian Gaborik, a star forward who would go on to lead the team to a championship with a league-high 14 goals in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Lombardi’s luck would change in 2015 when he sent a defensive prospect and a first-round pick for Andrej Sekera, who proved to be a non-factor in the Kings’ dud 2014-2015 season.</p>\n<p>Even given Lombardi’s propensity for big moves at the deadline, this one still baffles as the Kings’ problem isn’t letting in goals, it’s scoring them. Let’s dissect the trade to see what Lombardi may have been thinking when he pulled the trigger on this transaction.</p>\n<p>Having a reliable goaltending tandem is never negative, but why would you choose to sit one when each of those goalies was Vezina candidates a year ago? It could point to some uncertainty regarding Quick’s health. With his jarring, athletic butterfly style, Quick is more exposed to the possibility of injury than a goalie with a stay-at-home, blocking style.</p>\n<p>Quick’s groin injury this year was the most severe of his career, and the Kings’ primary concern should be to avoid a chronic injury that might detract from his play throughout the remaining six seasons of his contract. If Budaj seemed to be a competent safety net, Bishop is a brick wall in front of a maximum security prison.</p>\n<p>Emotional attachment aside, the Kings didn’t have to give up a whole lot for “Big Ben” Bishop: they lost what was their third-string goalie at the start of the year, essentially traded up from a seventh-round to a fifth-round pick, gave up a defenseman (whom the team did not consider a top prospect) and a conditional pick. The conditional pick throws some salt into the mix, as it could soar to as high as the second round if the Kings do well in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>From the Lightning side, Andrei Vasilevskiy is the face of the future; Bishop has spent a relatively large amount of time on the bench given his $6 million cap hit (20 percent of which the Lightning will retain as part of the deal) and is an unrestricted free agent at season’s end. They were going to lose him anyway; Budaj will be a great second goalie to have as the team grooms Vasilevskiy to be its No. 1.</p>\n<p>As counterintuitive as it may seem, sporting two top-tier goalies may help to alleviate the Kings’ scoring troubles. The team’s dynamic shifts dramatically when Quick is in net. When Budaj was starting, many offensively minded forwards had to adjust their game to protect a vulnerable goalie situation (in terms of both efficiency and depth).</p>\n<p>The Kings’ defense also had to double-down on their efforts and play a largely conservative game focused on protecting their goalie instead of creating scoring chances. With Quick in net (and now a “second” Quick in Bishop), the Kings can relax their style to generate more offense with the reassurance that reliable goaltending brings.</p>\n<p>Here’s where Lombardi’s chess game gets interesting. The Kings have four double-header games of their remaining 20. Of those games, three(!) include a game against the team that may be standing in their way of a playoff spot: the Calgary Flames.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with a fourth game against Calgary in the final week, these games present a possible plus-or-minus 16-point swing in the standings the Kings can’t afford to be on the wrong side of.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Kings take the top goalie on the trade block off the table for the Flames, a team that has given up the most goals of any team in playoff position in the Western Conference. Now every team the Kings play will have to face either Bishop or Quick, which is certainly not an enviable position to be in.</p>\n<p>With two days left until the trade deadline, there is still a possibility Bishop is flipped to another team that would be willing to send a reputable forward to the Kings. Lombardi, however, has softened this stance, saying, “No, no. Bishop needs to play.”</p>\n<p>So it seems the Kings will roll with two No. 1 goaltenders in a last-ditch effort to move into playoff positioning. As Kings fans mourn the sacrifice of St. Peter, a goalie who ascended to fan favorite as quickly as he was traded away, a new piece will be in place for a deep playoff run with Bishop.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/kings-trade-for-shiny-new-pawn-but-why-a-goalkeeper/","id":1901,"author":{"id":316,"name":"Zack Zimmerman"},"related":[1900,1899,1898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Participating in Claremont Convergence Invite, Sat.

Last year, the Leopards finished 18-6, their best record in program history, losing in the final of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>Their great run last year was a big improvement considering they had only won 13 games in the previous two years combined.</p>\n<p>Along with the players, a key to their success came from former Head Coach William Rodriguez. Last season, Rodriguez was named the SCIAC Women’s Water Polo Coach of the Year before stepping down to take a Director of Aquatics job elsewhere.</p>\n<p>One year removed from a fantastic season, the Leopards return almost everyone with only one freshman in the mix.</p>\n<p>La Verne’s roster is comprised of 13 juniors and seniors compared to only six for UCSB. These two teams met last year in the same event when UCSB won 21-6.</p>\n<p>The second opponent for Santa Barbara in the Claremont Convergence will be the host Pomona-Pitzer, who the Gauchos defeated 15-5 earlier in the year at their Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Pomona-Pitzer arrives with only one victory in 10 games. The Sagehens began the season with an eight-game losing streak by an average of almost nine goals per contest.</p>\n<p>Most of the team is back from last year, including a core of four players who were the Sagehens top-four goal scorers. One of those players is junior attacker Morgan McCracken, who was selected as the SCIAC Water Polo Player of the Week after tallying her first multi-goal game of the season last week.</p>\n<p>Looking to turn this season around, the current nucleus of players have experienced some success in recent years with at least 19 wins in four of the last five seasons.</p>\n<p>In their most recent games, Pomona-Pitzer won 17-3 and lost 13-11. They seem to be moving in the right direction heading into this weekend.</p>\n<p>After taking part in the Claremont Convergence, the Gauchos will travel back to UCSB for a home game versus No. 24 Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>The 8-7 roadrunners are 6-2 in their last eight games.

Azu-Irondi also ran the first leg of the men’s 4x400m relay, with the Gaucho foursome finishing first in an impressive 3:26.47.</p>\n<p>Junior Jenna Hinkle placed first in the women’s mile, dominating the field in a blistering 4:54.60, only to come back and repeat in the 3000m in 9:47.00, 10th on UCSB’s all-time list. Senior Adam Avila also had a great race in the men’s 3000m, finishing in 8:35.60 in his first race back from an All-Region XC season.</p>\n<p>Senior Tori Usgaard and sophomore Jazmin Moss — who were perhaps the most successful UCSB athletes for the brief indoor season — continued their great run of jumps. Usgaard reached 18’10.75″ in the women’s long jump to claim first place, a new PR, and Moss, in addition to her leg on the victorious 4x100m relay, won the women’s triple with a 38’3.25″ mark.</p>\n<p>In the throws, senior Matthew Kuskey threw 225’8.5” in the javelin to win the event and climb to second on UCSB’s all-time list in the new-style javelin. The senior also threw the fifth-longest in school history with a throw of 222’0″ last year, and he will be hoping to make enough improvement over the course of the year to threaten Thomas Gore-Schreck’s program record of 234’3”.</p>\n<p>Apart from the women’s javelin, the Gauchos won every throwing event. Junior Kayla Thayer succeeded in the women’s discus with a throw of 139’5.0″ and junior Kordell Hampton won on the men’s side at 164’10.5’</p>\n<p>Senior Valerie Nestor was victorious in the hammer with a bomb of 172’5.25” and senior Stephen Leach claimed first with a mark of 184’8.0″ in the men’s.</p>\n<p>As a cherry on top, Thayer and Leach each finished first in the men’s and women’s shot put, respectively. Thayer’s 43’5.0” mark was good enough for her second win of the day, and it took Leach a 51’6.5” toss to follow suit.</p>\n<p>“This was the best roundup I think I’ve witnessed for my group,” said Associate Head Coach Cody Fleming of the throwers, the group of athletes he works with in training.</p>\n<p>In last year’s All-UC Meet, the Gauchos lost in heartbreaking fashion, with the meet undecided until the last relay and UCSB finishing second by just one point. With a win in their pockets at the first outdoor meet of the year, Head Coach Pete Dolan will be hoping his team can repeat its Roundup success and string together a couple of strong showings that could set the foundation for a really impressive year.</p>\n<p>The All-UC meet will begin on Saturday, March 4 at the Triton Track &amp; Field Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/","id":5703,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5702,5701,5700],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Softball Hoping To Shake Latest Slump at St. George Red Desert Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently on a two-game winning streak, UCSB softball is in a must-win situation at 4-10 heading into the weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Five games stand before the 4-10 UCSB softball team this weekend in Cedar City, Utah at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

Her partner in the infield, freshman Alyssa Diaz, will also be important to the Gauchos’ success this weekend, with two home runs and the same nine RBI in her first 14 games of college softball.</p>\n<p>The biggest test in Cedar City will be whether or not the Gaucho pitchers can come around after a rough start to 2017. Sophomore Veronika Gulvin and freshman Felisha Noriega have been the team’s stalwarts, but both have struggled mightily. Gulvin has three of the team’s four wins, and she holds the better ERA, but both have four losses, and “better” doesn’t necessarily mean good, with Gulvin’s ERA sitting at 4.56 and Noriega’s at 8.24.</p>\n<p>For the Wolverines, senior outfielder Courtney Beavers has been the team’s most impressive hitter, slashing .571/.625/.786, with three doubles, three runs scored and 11 total bases, all of which pace the team. Senior middle infielder Brittney Vansway has had a hand in much of the team’s production, knocking seven RBI in the season’s first four games.</p>\n<p>Junior Lauren Frailey leads the team with nine and a third innings pitched, and she has only allowed eight hits and two earned runs over that span. Senior Bailey Moore is close on her tail with eight innings thrown, and her 3.50 ERA isn’t too shabby either, suggesting the Gauchos will face a tougher path than the Wolverine’s 0-4 record would indicate.</p>\n<p>Iowa State (7-7) has been a streaky team to start the season, sweeping the Tennessee State Tournament the weekend of Feb. 17 before failing to win a game in the following weekend’s slate.</p>\n<p>Led by freshman infielder Sami Williams and junior outfielder Kelsey McFarland, the Cyclones pack an impressive punch offensively. Williams has slashed .300/.349/.625 to start the year, but somehow is being outdone by McFarland, who’s put up a .463/.521/.610 line.</p>\n<p>While Williams has the edge in RBI and home runs (11 to nine and three to one, respectively), McFarland gains her advantage having drawn three more walks, accumulated seven more hits and scored two more runs.</p>\n<p>The team boasts three impressive pitchers, all with ERA at or below 3.26. Sophomore Savannah Sanders is by far the team’s most relied-upon arm, as she’s thrown almost double the innings of her teammates (43) and appeared in 12 of Iowa State’s 14 games.</p>\n<p>Saturday will pit the Gauchos against the 8-5 Nevada Wolf Pack and the dynamic corner infield duo of sophomore Alyssa Mendez at third base and junior Jennifer Purcell at first. It’s been a hot start to the season for both, who’ve put up staggering hitting numbers as well as holding down the infield defense.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Kali Sargent and senior McKenna Isenberg head the pitching rotation, and the Gauchos will have to work their way around the two savvy, veteran throwers, who’ve accounted for the vast majority of the team’s innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The afternoon opponent for UCSB on the 4th will be Southern Utah, a 1-7 team that has failed to score more than three runs in all but one game. Five of the Thunderbirds’ games saw the team score one or zero runs, good news for a Gauchos pitching staff which struggled at the season’s onset.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Sarah Murphy is the team’s leading hitter with a .385 average, but her identical slugging percentage shows just how little extra base hitting she’s been able to provide the team. Sophomore utility player Kendall Kapitzke has the team’s one home run, and her .176 batting average is propped up by a .462 OBP.</p>\n<p>The Thunderbirds have tried several pitchers this season, but senior Kristen Hostetler has been the most relied upon, throwing in four games, starting a team-high three and doubling second place on her team with 16.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final match of the weekend will have the Gauchos face a Nebraska-Omaha team they were able to overcome 4-3 in extra innings at Stanford on Feb. 19. Since that game, the Mavericks have hit a losing streak, dropping four of their following five games.</p>\n<p>The lineup, which has been remarkably consistent with eight players starting and playing in all 13 of the Mavericks games, is led by two stud outfielders junior Kelly Pattison and senior Lia Mancuso. The former has a slash line of .359/.419/.615, three home runs, eight RBI and seven runs scored, while the latter has almost been her match, slashing .351/.400/.541, batting in four runs, taking one ball deep and collecting four doubles.</p>\n<p>Pitching has been more of a struggle for Nebraska-Omaha, with neither sophomore Laura Roecker nor senior Abbie Clanton, the team’s two main pitchers, having winning records or earning run averages below 4.00.</p>\n<p>Keys to the weekend will be the Gauchos’ ability to keep the game close, as they’ve had a penchant for getting blown out in games they lose. Furthermore, if the ‘Chos are able to get the bats firing and they can get up at least four or five runs per game, the pitching staff should be able to hold it down from there.</p>\n<p><em>A version

The Gales improve to 5-2 on the year and defeat the Gauchos at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>The starter on the bump for UCSB was right-hander junior Chris Clements who pitched pretty decently overall by going five and one-third innings only giving up three earned runs, nine hits while striking out seven batters.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before coming into Tuesday’s matchup, the Gaels left-handed starting pitcher sophomore Ty Madrigal had an earned run average of 7.36 in just two appearances.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Madrigal reversed the script by pitching an absolutely great game as he only allowed two hits, no runs and managed to strike out seven. The lefty pitcher would prove too much for the Gaucho, which is predominantly left.</p>\n<p>The Elk Grove, Calif., native was dominant Tuesday using his two-seam fastball that would cut in on the hands of lefties. On top of this, Madrigal would use his masterful control of his slider, curveball, and changeup to carve up the strike zone.</p>\n<p>Gaucho hitters would fly out nine times of the 11 total they had for the game when Madrigal was on the mound. This was very uncharacteristic of a Gaucho team that came off an offensive barrage in a sweep of the Tulane Green Wave.</p>\n<p>The only bright spot of the afternoon offensively for the Gauchos was junior first baseman Austin Bush. Bush would smoke a low line drive homerun over the right field fence against lefty reliever freshman Ken Waldichuk in the bottom of the ninth. Bush would have two of the three total hits for the Gauchos and finished the evening 2-4 with the lone RBI.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the diamond, Saint Mary’s offense proved to be impressive by collecting 10 hits off the Gaucho pitching staff. Leading the way was designated hitter freshman Joe Vranesh who went three for four with one RBI.  The gusts blowing out to right field helped a couple balls that were struck in the gap by the Gaels, particularly on a double hit by catcher Jackson Thoreson (2 for 5, 1 RBI) to lead off the second inning. Later that inning, Thoreson would come around to score the first run for Saint Mary’s.</p>\n<p>Although hitting the ball well, the Gaels’ offense was helped by not only the wind but by the Gaucho defense as well.  In the top of the fifth inning, the ’Chos would commit four continuous errors. Two errors came from left fielder junior Colton Burns who has recently made the transition from second base to the outfield for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>For the first committed error, Burns would let a ball get by him on a routine base hit to the outfield. The ball would reach the fence allowing the batter to reach third.</p>\n<p>The second error happened after Burns dove head first for a ball, trapping it in his glove but losing sight of the ball below his feet allowing the runner to advance to second.</p>\n<p>Another error came on a grounder that took a wild hop on redshirt junior second baseman JJ Muno. Unfortunately for Muno, although doing his best to block the ball and pick it up with his bare hand, he had no play at first.</p>\n<p>The last of the errors came on a pop fly to third baseman redshirt junior Kenny Corey that was blown around by the swirling wind. The ball would hit off the end Corey’s glove and drop to the ground. All runners would be safe.</p>\n<p>From these four errors, two runs would score. If not for these blunders, the Gauchos would be looking at an entirely different game altogether in the bottom of the ninth, especially after Bush’s homerun.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who are now sitting at a .500 winning percentage, had a pretty decent home stand overall winning three games and losing one. Now the boys will head off to Kentucky this weekend to play three games of a long seven-game road series that will also feature four games at Brigham Young University the following week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/","id":4141,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday’s tennis meet began, per usual, with the doubles portion of the competition. The No. 1 slot featured the duo sensation of junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays yet again. They made quick work of the home side opposition as they put up a 6-1 final score, improving their undefeated record to six straight wins. With sophomores Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm following up with a 6-0 sweep, the Gauchos went on to ensure the doubles advantage point.</p>\n<p>The team’s success was reflected upon the singles portion of the meet as well, as UCSB only allowed a single point in San Fran’s 7-6, 7-5 match between junior Johan Joenhagan and Mays.</p>\n<p>Freund, who remains undefeated in singles play, won at 6-1/6-2, while Moreno de Alboran won at 6-4/7-6 and Holm won at 6-3/7-5. To finish up that day’s play, junior Cody Rakela tallied his 6-3/6-4 win, and senior Teague Hamilton ended at 6-4/6-3.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to Sunday, the Gauchos traveled to Cal’s Hellman Tennis Complex for their afternoon meet.</p>\n<p>Mays and Freund went on to extend their doubles streak once again with a 5-3 victory. Ultimately, the score went unfinished as Cal claimed the doubles advantage point with slot wins by No. 2, freshman Dominic Barretto/senior Florian Lakat, and No. 3, freshman Bjorn Hoffmann/junior J.T. Nishimura.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a hill to climb early on, as the overall score went to 3-0 after the Golden Bears earned the first two singles matches; senior Andre Goransson defeated Mays 6-2/6-0 and No. 20 Lakat beat Moreno 6-4/6-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB would bounce back and even the score thanks to juniorChase Masciorini’s 6-3 victories, Rakela at 6-4/4-1 and Holm after a three-set nail biter at 4-6/6-4/4-1.</p>\n<p>The overall score leveled at 3-3 with only one final singles match between Freund and Cal junior Billy Griffith.

After a brief ceremony celebrating UCSB’s sole senior, the game got off to a quick start with Highlander junior forward Alex Larsson scoring in the first 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>At 6’10”, Larsson barely had to jump to get the ball in the basket. Although both teams racked up points quickly, raising the score to 20-11 UCSB by 12:30, the Gauchos did a great job of keeping a tight defense. By preventing UCR from driving, UCSB defense was able to keep their score down, but was having trouble guarding the outside three pointers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This night was a celebration of Childress, and whether it was the team’s energy or the fact that it was going to be his last game at the Thunderdome, he was on a roll. Scoring a total of 21 points, he went 4-4 on his first four three pointers and ended up 5-8 overall on threes.</p>\n<p>“You have to work as hard as you can because time flies by and it’s not going to wait for you,” Childress said.</p>\n<p>With Childress on fire and Gaucho defense looking strong, the only slight improvement possible was getting more shots off. The UCSB team was on the same page, had great ball movement and knew where everyone was on the court.</p>\n<p>One effective Highlander tactic utilized throughout the entire game was a hard press. With the Gaucho point guard and one or two other players covered and searching for an open pass, UCR efficiently ran down the UCSB shot clock, giving the Gaucho offense only around 15 seconds to shoot rather than the usual 30.</p>\n<p>UCR senior forward Secean Johnson did not have as great of a half as spectators might have expected. Only putting two points on the board, he was all over the court and takings sloppy shots during the first half, but found his stride in the second period.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played the first half guns blazing, leading by up to 12 multiple times. For the majority of the half UCSB was able to hold onto a 10-point lead.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sophomore forward Jarriesse Blackmon had a great game, both defensively and offensively, even scoring on two separate occasions exactly as the shot clock ran out, sending the crowd into a frenzy both times.</p>\n<p>With two minutes left in the first period, UCR stepped up and managed to bring the score within one point, Gauchos leading 32-31.</p>\n<p>At the half, Gaucho shooting was at a season high with a 54.5 field goal percentage. 15 of 31 Highlander points were from their bench while on the UCSB side of the court, 15 points alone were from star senior Childress, who had made 5-6 three pointers.</p>\n<p>Although he came away with three personal fouls, freshman guard Christian Terrell was an essential asset to the Gaucho victory, not only scoring but also defending.</p>\n<p>“Terrell’s defense made a real difference for us,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In the first half, we did not play anywhere near as well when he was off the floor.”</p>\n<p>Rebounds were bountiful for the Gauchos this game, all players doing a great job of not only getting a first hand on the ball but keeping possession and working as a team to move it up the court. Junior forward Alex Hart was all hands, grabbing an impressive 15 boards this game.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman guards Max Heidegger and Clifton Powell made big runs. Both had the ability to work from either side of the court and shoot from outside. Powell specifically had a great night, especially after a foul that resulted in Highlander points. He turned up the energy and even made a glorious shot from a couple feet outside of the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“In practice, I’ve been working on catching and shooting,” Powell said. “My primary game is getting the ball to the basket.”</p>\n<p>Despite Highlander efforts to catch up to the Gauchos, UCSB was able to keep their lead until the very end. Winning 68-61, the game ended in style with a flying dunk from Terrell.</p>\n<p>The best part of the night was the last minute of the game. Starting with a few fans in the student section and quickly spreading to the entire events center, an “Eric Childress” chant began and continued until the end of the game, with all Gaucho supports on their feet.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great Gaucho performance and a fantastic senior night for Childress. The Gauchos will next face Cal State Fullerton on the road on Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76030\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76030\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/","id":493,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[492,491,490],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Loss to UC Davis Results In Third-Straight Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-28-at-12.55.39-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-28-at-12.55.39-PM.png?resize=843%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the battle for seeding in the Big West Tournament becoming more intense, the UCSB women's basketball team is on the verge of descending once again after experiencing its third consecutive loss on...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team, which was in position to secure first place just over a month ago, continues to falter in its quest to secure a top seed in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76011\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76011\" data-attachment-id=\"76011\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/onome-jemerigbe-brings-the-ball-up-the-court-jenny-luo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WBBallvs.Northridge_02092017_JennyLuo-05-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Onome Jemerigbe brings the ball up the court.

Able to sustain its first-place rank in the conference, the Aggies’ streak is their longest since winning nine consecutive games during the 2005-06 season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its matchup versus UCSB, UC Davis had shot 50 percent or above from the field in its last two games. The Aggies’ hot shooting continued against the Gauchos as they ended the game a shade below the aforementioned mark at 49 percent on 25-of-51 shooting, but they made up for it from beyond the arc, making 10-of-20, a major contrast to their 2-of-16 finish in the first meeting.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman recorded her sixth double-double of the season as she led the Gauchos in scoring with 17 points and a game-high 10 rebounds. She finished 5-of-8 from the field and 7-of-7 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Two leads as the teams traded baskets in the opening minutes were UCSB’s only leads during the game.</p>\n<p>Trailing 4-5, UC Davis made an 8-0 run that kickstarted the Aggies, who extended their lead as the game progressed.</p>\n<p>Igniting the scoring stretch was sophomore guard Kourtney Eaton with a midrange jump shot. Never losing its lead after the field goal, UC Davis added to its lead with back-to-back made three-pointers by junior forward Pele Gianotti and junior guard/forward Dani Nafekh on its next two possessions to take a 11-4 lead.</p>\n<p>Gianotti concluded Saturday with a game-high 19 points, going 6-of-12 from the field, 3-of-7 from long range and 4-of-4 at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>A quick layup by Edelman helped UCSB trim Davis’s lead to 13-7 at the end of the period.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting just 34.8 percent from behind the perimeter (8-of-23), it was an improved shooting performance for the Gauchos, as it was their most made three-pointers since creating a new program record on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Coco Miller knocked down more than half of UCSB’s three-pointers, scoring the Gauchos’ first two field goals in the second quarter from downtown to cut their deficit to 13-18. Scoring each of her field goals from deep, Miller tallied 15 points on 5-of-12 and 5-of-9 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>After tying her career high of 27 points in the first game against UCSB, it was expected that redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch would be the Gauchos’ main concern.</p>\n<p>Both Miller and Bertsch played pivotal roles in the second quarter; it was the game’s highest scoring period, with UC Davis taking a 26-21 advantage.</p>\n<p>Miller scored 12 of her 15 points in the period on 4-of-6 shooting, while Bertsch scored 11 points and missed just one shot attempt as she went 5-of-6.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara held the potential Big West Player of the Year to 15 points, Bertsch was efficient with her shot selection as she finished the game 7-of-13 from the field. Her seven-straight points beginning at the 7:36 mark of the second period captured UC Davis’s first double-figure lead of the game at 25-13.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to come within a nine-point deficit after a made three-pointer by Miller, trailing 30-21, but could not contain the Aggies’ streaky shooting of 76.9 percent and entered halftime down 39-27.</p>\n<p>Edelman scored the Gauchos’ first six points of the second half, yet it was their worst shooting quarter; they shot a horrid 18.8 percent from the field (3-of-16) and went 0-of-7 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB once again trimmed UCD’s lead to nine points at 33-42 after a pair of made free throws by Edelman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ comeback efforts were halted as UC Davis embarked on a 10-2 run to close out the third with its largest lead of the game, 52-35.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, UCSB performed best during the fourth quarter, outscoring the Aggies 26-18. It recorded a 56.3 field goal percentage and shot 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>While Edelman padded her stats with eight points in the quarter, redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler was vital during the Gauchos’ late spurt, scoring nine of her 13 points.</p>\n<p>All nine points occurred in the game’s final three minutes, during which at one point she trimmed UC Davis’ lead to 63-56 with 1:36 remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies’ clutch free-throw shooting — making 10-of-12 — led to them securing their victory in their final home game of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home for its final two games of the season. It will face UC Irvine and Blue-Green rival Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76021\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76021\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/","id":492,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[491,490,489],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"After Weekend Sweep, Gauchos Look Ahead to Saint Mary’s","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball_vsTulane-170226-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball_vsTulane-170226-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to patch things up in its home opener over the week, currently on a three-game winning streak, the UCSB baseball team will host St. Mary's for a weekday matchup.

Thoreson is so far this season hitting an outstanding .400 with two home runs and has a slugging percentage of .760. In the series against the Washington Huskies, Thoreson went 9/17 (.529 Avg.) with a home run, five runs scored and three RBI.</p>\n<p>Another big bat to look out for Tuesday is Gael third baseman Charles Zaloumis.

There may be a possibility that Saint Mary’s Head Coach Eric Valenzuela will move Zaloumis in the line-up, but as the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</p>\n<p>The expected starters for Tuesday’s matchup are UCSB’s sophomore RHP Noah Davis (2-0) and Saint Mary’s senior RHP Cameron Neff (0-0). Last time out, Gaucho ace Davis was spectacular against the Tulane Green Wave, going seven innings, striking out 10 and giving up only two earned runs while earning his second win of the season.</p>\n<p>Neff’s last outing was a completely different story, as Neff went five innings, giving up four earned runs off nine hits against the Huskies. With the Gauchos collecting 35 hits and scoring 27 runs this past weekend, it will be very interesting to see how Neff and the rest of the Saint Mary’s pitching staff will fare against the surging Gaucho offense.</p>\n<p>Continuing with the now very dangerous Gaucho offense, three bats awoke for the Gauchos against Tulane, who will be key factors heading into Tuesday’s contest. The senior outfielder and DH Billy Fredrick had a huge series against the Green Wave, hitting .714 (5 for 7) with four runs and five RBI. Redshirt junior third baseman Kenny Corey also had himself a great few games, going 5 for 9 (.556) with three runs and three RBI.</p>\n<p>However, the most important bat this weekend was that of junior first baseman Austin Bush. Bush, who headed into the Tulane series one for his last 15, found his swing, hitting .545 (6 for 11) with one home run and four RBI. If the lefty can continue his opposite-field approach into Tuesday’s game, Bush will to continue to find good barrel on the ball.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Colton Burns also continues to rip the ball for the Gauchos, hitting .476 this season. Burns, who also had himself a series against Tulane (5 for 8, 7 runs), will be a problem for the Gaels if he continues to get on base. Through 31 plate appearances, the junior transfer from College of Canyons has a mind-blowing on-base percentage of .645 and scored a team-leading eight times this season. Paired with his .667 slugging percent, Burns is a very early leader for team MVP.</p>\n<p>After a comeback ninth-inning walk-off win Sunday afternoon to get the sweep against Tulane, the Gauchos have all the momentum in the world for the Saint Mary’s matchup. Still, this one game appearance by the Saint Mary’s Gaels will prove to be yet another test for the Gauchos.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76031\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76031\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/","id":4142,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Big West Player of the Week Gilbertson defeated Oregon’s Julia Eshet in three sets as well, 7-5, 1-6, 10-4. However, the Gauchos didn’t win another match as the Ducks played extremely well, winning four-straight matches as they went on their way to win the meet at a score of 5-2.</p>\n<p>The Ducks flourished in their first home game back since their two-game Texas road trip early on in the month. Being out of competition for nearly two weeks did not seem to trip up the Oregon squad at all as the Ducks were able to perform well as a team in their successful effort to get back to .500.</p>\n<p>The loss was a tough one for UC Santa Barbara as it brought the Gauchos’ four-game winning streak to an end in a loss in which the team struggled to get any momentum going. A win against the Ducks would have given UCSB a winning record for the first time ever this season, but the Ducks’ performance put the Gauchos under .500, where they have spent a majority of their time this season.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, UCSB found itself traveling further north to Seattle, where they played the Washington Huskies. The Gauchos got off to a good start in doubles play as Silveira and Gilbertson defeated Katarina Kopcalic and Lana Slavica 6-3.</p>\n<p>Former nationally ranked Washington pair Miki Kobayashi and Nour Abbes were able to handle the No. 52 Gaucho pair of Dubavets and Stojic, 6-3. With the doubles point up for grabs, the No. 41 tandem of Baker and Yamada were unable to secure the doubles point for the Santa Barbara squad as the efforts of Washington’s Stacey Fung and Kenadi Hance proved to be too strong.</p>\n<p>In singles play, the Huskies dominated the Gauchos. Every single player for the Gauchos lost in their match with only one match being pushed to three sets. The Huskies improved their record to 10-2 and extended their winning streak to four over the course of the weekend.</p>\n<p>For Washington, their performance in this meet was impressive and sweeping a talented team like UCSB is a good sign for them as they go on to start their conference play two weeks from now.</p>\n<p>The performance against Washington capped off a disappointing weekend which saw the Gauchos’ four-game winning streak come to a close, a return back to a losing record and a long road trip back home after getting swept. These losses are surely deflating and the Gauchos are once again forced to climb back to a .500 record over the course of a four-game home stand beginning next weekend.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play their next game at home against the University of New Mexico Lobos on Sunday, March 5 at 10 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76028\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/womens-tennis-has-streak-ended-over-the-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76028\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/womens-tennis-has-streak-ended-over-the-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/womens-tennis-has-streak-ended-over-the-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/womens-tennis-has-streak-ended-over-the-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/womens-tennis-has-streak-ended-over-the-weekend/","id":4819,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4818,4817,4816],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":57,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
