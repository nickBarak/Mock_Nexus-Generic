Senior midfielder Dion Acoff was pulled down in the box, resulting in a penalty kick for the Gauchos. Freshman midfielder Ema</p>\n<p>Boateng stepped up to take the kick, but the shot was saved by senior goalkeeper Bryan Oliver. Oliver currently leads the Big West in saves with 6.2 per game.</p>\n<p>“[Oliver] guessed it right,” Baiden said. “Before [Boateng] was going to take it, he had to stand there for a long time. He hit it well, but the goalie guessed it.”</p>\n<p>With the game still tied, UCSB received a break in the 19th minute when senior defender Matt Linenberger received a red card for arguing with the official, giving the Gauchos a one man advantage the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Cesar Castillo took the free kick from about 25 yards out, which was saved by Oliver. When Oliver landed, however, both he and the ball were across the goal line, giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead in the 20th minute. The goal was Castillo’s first of the season.</p>\n<p>“That was a good shot,” Baiden said. “I think the goalie was expecting him to cross it and he just went for it.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing a man down, the Hornets equalized in the 39th minute on a defensive breakdown at midfield by the Gauchos. Junior defender Matthew Glodack passed the ball back to sophomore keeper Austin Mansker, but left the pass short. Sophomore forward Chimdum Mez picked up the pass, and with a one v. one with Mansker, fired a shot from just outside the 18-yard box. Mansker left his line to cut off the angle, but had no chance of saving Mez’s shot, which tied the game at one apiece.</p>\n<p>“It was one of those games [just like] we’ve seen before [where] we’ve been up and we give up an easy goal,” Ryan said. “It was devastating, but we’ve been talking about how we need to let those things go. I thought we dominated the rest of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB regained the lead in the 55th minute when Glodack sent a beautiful pass into the box, which was headed into the back of the net by freshman forward Charlie Miller.</p>\n<p>“The second goal was huge,” Baiden said. “In all the games we’ve played, we get in front and then we’re tied and we end up losing.”</p>\n<p>Unlike in past games where Santa Barbara relinquished its lead late, UCSB held on to its 2-1 lead for the victory, snapping a three game losing streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays its final game of the season Saturday at Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/","id":1617,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1616,1615,1614],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Face First Place Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team is in Hawaii tonight in preparation for a showdown between the first and second place teams in the Big West.

Last month, UCSB went 5-3 and is still in the midst of a modest two-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>The offense has started to really come together in recent weeks as the Gauchos are now scoring from all across the court. In their most recent victory, four players recorded double-digit kills, and also hit over .230 as a team and recorded nine service aces the last two games.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, however, enters the match as the hottest team in perhaps all of volleyball. The Rainbow Wahine have won twelve straight games, dating all the way back to a Sept. 9 loss against UCLA. Hawaii junior outside hitter Emily Hartong is also coming off arguably the best week of her career.</p>\n<p>Hartong earned her third Big West Player of the Week honor for her performances against Long Beach State and UC Irvine. She was also named Sports Imports/AVCA Division I Player of the Week. She recorded a career-high 33 kills and 15 digs last Friday and 29 kills and a career-high 16 digs on Saturday. In the last meeting between these two teams on Oct. 6, Santa Barbara fell in three sets at home. The Gauchos managed just 13 points in the first set, but steadily got better through the night, scoring 16 and 21 in the second and third sets, respectively. The game boiled down to the blocking of Hawaii and the Gauchos’ mistakes that made the game so one-sided. “We will have to spread the court around,” Gregory said. “We will hope they don’t attack our right side blocking and our right side defense like they did last time because that was the problem.”</p>\n<p>Since that loss though, UCSB has gotten hot and it may be worth noting that as good as the Rainbow Wahine have been, their only two losses have come at home.</p>\n<p>Tonight, the game will take place at Hawaii’s Stan Sheriff Center at 10 p.m. Pacific time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-place-hawaii/","id":5382,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5381,5380,5379],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Out of Playoffs, UCSB Travels North","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s soccer team hopes to rebound from three consecutive overtime losses when the team takes on Sacramento State in its second to last game of the season tonight.

UCSB currently leads the Big West in shots with 17.65 per game while the Hornets are last with just 11.44 per game.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara ranks last in the league in goals during conference play with just 1.12 per game, so UCSB will need to take advantage of its chances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos certainly executed offensively in their last matchup against Sac State, scoring two goals on 23 shots. The goals came less than eight minutes into the game and just 12 seconds apart.</p>\n<p>“That game, we came out with a lot of energy and if we want the same result, we have to work hard and put some balls on frame,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said.</p>\n<p>Scoring one of those goals was Ryan, who currently ranks fourth in the Big West in points with eight goals and one assist.</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Hornets are a trio of players in senior midfielder Chris Sandoval, junior midfielder Gabe Silveira and junior forward Isaac Ikyurav. Silveira and Ikyurav have each scored five goals on the year while Sandoval has contributed four. The trio has also tallied nine assists.</p>\n<p>“We have to be compact and aware,” Ryan said. “We have to play both sides of the ball: offense and defense.”</p>\n<p>While both teams have dangerous attackers, UCSB and Sac State also feature the two best goalkeepers in the Big West. The Gauchos’ Austin Mansker leads the conference in goals against average at .88. On the other hand, Sacramento’s Bryan Oliver leads the league in save percentage and saves with 81.6 percent and 6.2, respectively.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game against Sacramento State is set for 7 p.m. at Hornet Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48510\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48510\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/","id":1615,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1614,1613,1612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Young and the Restless","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After three years of the best core of basketball players the university has ever seen, the UCSB men’s basketball team will try to reload as they start the 2012-13 season.

Taylor return after splitting time at the point last season. Garth (2.8 PPG, 2.4 APG) improved his shooting during the summer, a noticeable flaw in his game last season. Taylor (3.1 PPG, 1.8 APG), meanwhile, returns with his superb speed and ability to drive into the lane. Neither controlled the position last season, however, as Orlando Johnson ran the offense for the latter half of the year.</p>\n<p>Entering the fold are freshmen Dalante Dunklin and Duke DaRe. Dunklin brings a physical nature similar to Johnson’s, according to Head Coach Bob Williams, and will help the team tremendously with his tenacious perimeter defense. DaRe will see playing time as a fourth option at the point after coming to UCSB as a preferred walk-on.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know who is going to take the reins there; it’s an interesting battle,” Williams said. “We feel very comfortable about our point guard position. We think we have great depth, we have four players there who are going to play … so we feel pretty comfortable with that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Shooting Guard</strong></p>\n<p>Returning at guard for UCSB is sharp-shooting junior Kyle Boswell who shot .435 from behind the three-point line last season, good for third in the league. Boswell averaged 7.5 points per game and ranked fourth on the team in both points and minutes. Coming off the bench last season as the sixth man, Boswell was an integral part of the team, adding much-needed scoring off the bench.</p>\n<p>“We think right now, we probably have to start [Boswell] early,” Williams said. “Ultimately, we would love to be able to have the luxury of bringing him off the bench. He’s so good, such a spark, such a valuable player coming off the bench, but we have to wait and see.”</p>\n<p>True freshman Michael Bryson comes in as a talented recruit who can shoot and will likely spell Boswell at the two position, at least for the beginning of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to take some time. We’re going to have some patience to let this team grow up a little bit,” Williams said. “We’re the youngest team in the country. Between walk-ons and scholarship kids, we have 11 freshmen, and you need some patience to develop that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Forwards</strong></p>\n<p>After battling injuries for most of last season, junior Keegan Hornbuckle returns with a starting spot most likely in hand. Hornbuckle averaged 3.6 points last season but was inconsistent throughout the year, sometimes looking like a bench player while other moments like a star caliber player. He will likely split time between the small forward and power forward spot.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got to grow up. They have to go through their growing pains,” Williams said. “It’s not going to come out and be all smooth and a bed of roses early. There’s going to be ups and downs, we’re going to look good for four minutes and bad for four minutes.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Taran Brown will look to gain action on the floor for the first time this season with a strong chance at starting at the small forward spot. At 6’8”, Brown possesses the height for the power forward position but is a talented athlete and shooter better suited for perimeter play.</p>\n<p>“It’s the idea that we have to gradually be learning, and they have to be sponges and absorbing and putting into action what they absorb,” Williams said. “They’re a talented group, we’ve got good basketball players; it’s just a matter of growing up.”</p>\n<p>Coming off the bench will be Australian sophomore Lewis Thomas, who averaged 1.1 points and 1.3 rebounds per game last season. Thomas will fill in as a backup to Hornbuckle at the four position.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Big Men</strong></p>\n<p>Possibly the most recognized player returning for the Gauchos is sophomore center Alan Williams, who averaged 6.9 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season. Half of Williams’ rebounds were on the offensive end, as he led the Gauchos in rebounds despite playing only 17 minutes a game. Williams became a starter at the end of last season and is the leading candidate once again this season to lead the team in rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to utilize Al by setting good screens and [him] being a good rebounder,” Williams said. “We have to utilize him by getting him the ball on the right place on the floor where he can be effective. He has to do a good job of playing without fouling.”</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler will spell Williams at the center position while playing power forward as well. Brewe brings his 6’8”, 242-pound bruising frame into the low post for the Gauchos and is primarily an inside player.</p>\n<p>“It’s just important that they have a confidence level in teammates and they come out and play confident,” Williams said. “You can’t play scared in the game of basketball, and if you do, you’re going to get eaten up. All of these freshmen have had a pretty high level of success in high school, so they’re all pretty confident kids.”</p>\n<p>Beeler meanwhile is 6’10” but a mere 210 pounds. In his senior season of high school, Beeler averaged seven blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“The most pleasant surprise for us is the readiness of Mitch Brewe and the readiness of Sam Beeler,” Williams said. “We feel pretty comfortable if we have to play either one of them right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins play on Thursday, Nov. 1 in an exhibition game when they host La Verne College. Without a set starting lineup, Thursday’s game will give coaches and fans alike a good look at how the team performs and potentially who will step up in live-game situations.</p>\n<p>“We’ll run people in that game in waves to get a feel for what we have. There are so many new faces and so many new people that the idea of who starts really isn’t very important right now,” Williams said. “It’s us gaining information as coaches on our players whether or not we’re getting any better with what we’re trying to do. I anticipate there will be a lot of changing lineups with the first five to eight games.”</p>\n<p>Entering the season, UCSB was ranked fifth in the preseason conference poll, an homage to the team’s recent success, but also a realization that UCSB is no longer an unquestioned member at the top of the conference with the departure of the core group of seniors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s fair, a pretty good compliment to our recruiting,” Williams said. “In past years, teams that won the league were picked sixth in conference. So, get some chemistry, get gelled, who knows what could happen.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for the La Verne game is scheduled for this Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/","id":724,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[723,722,721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Champs Ready to Begin Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team will begin its quest for a second consecutive Big West title this Monday when it begins its season in an exhibition match against Vanguard.

In the Big West preseason polls, UCSB was predicted to finish third, behind Northridge and Pacific. Nevertheless, the team did receive three first place votes.</span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Last year, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, during her first year coaching the team, turned the Gauchos into a defensive powerhouse known for their blue collar mentality. The team led the Big West in scoring defense, allowing just 52.5 points per game. With Mitchell behind the wheel, the personality of this team will remain the same. Now, the players have a better feel for the system, but what plagued the Gauchos last season was the ability to score, so if they can cut down on their mistakes and put some points on the board, their defense will always keep them in games.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Despite losing two incredible seniors in Emilie Johnson, the team’s leading scorer and point guard, and Kelsey Adrian, the team’s leading three-point threat known for her versatility, the Gauchos have a similar look to last year’s team that took the Big West crown. The team features eight returning players, including three starters.</span></span></span></span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Here’s a breakdown of this year’s squad:</span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Guards</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Nicole Nesbit (junior)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — Last year, Nesbit came off the bench as a solid point guard. This year, the team is hers. Nesbit has the ability get to the basket and create her own shot or create for others. She also developed a nice jumper off the dribble. Last season, Nesbit was the team’s second leading scorer (behind Johnson ) at 8.2 points per game and gave fans a glimpse of what she’s capable offensively when she tallied a career high 20 points in the semifinal game of the Big West tournament against Pacific. She also averaged 2.2 assists last season, second on the team. This season, Mitchell will look for consistency from her upperclassman.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Melissa Zornig (junior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Zornig caught fire during the Big West playoffs last year, averaging 16.7 points. She set a career high against Pacific with 23 points and her efforts were rewarded as she was named to the All-Tournament Team. Zornig’s role on this year’s team will primarily be as a scorer. With a high basketball IQ, the ability to attack the rim, and a solid three point shot, Zornig should easily improve on her 6.8 points per game she set last season. Shooting 30.9 percent from behind the arc last season, second to only Adrian, expect Zornig to be the team’s main three point threat too. However, Zornig will also take on some of the point guard responsibilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Destini Mason (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> A starter last season, Mason is known for her defense and will be expected to guard the other team’s best guard night in and night out. She has great athletic ability, allowing her to create for others. She also has a solid midrange jump shot. According to Mitchell, Mason has improved immensely since we last saw her, playing much calmer. She has even become a leader on this team, taking the freshmen under her wing. While Mason’s contributions may not always show up in the box scores, her opponents always feel her defensive presence.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Angelei Aguirre (senior)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — We have yet to see the best of Aguirre, as she spent the majority of last season out with an injury. However, Mitchell gives Aguirre the most credit for leading the Gauchos to the championship. Aguirre is the team’s most versatile player, offensively and defensively, and has the ability to play positions one through four. Offensively, she can hit the 15-foot jumper and has the ball handling skills to even play point guard. Aguirre’s greatest strength on the offensive end, though, may be her passing. However, UCSB will need Aguirre to put some points on the board. Defensively, Aguirre will share the responsibilities with Mason of guarding the other team’s best player.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Madeline Campbell (sophomore)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — As a freshman, Campbell saw limited minutes last year. However, Campbell is a hard worker who can play in multiple positions for UCSB since she has good size at six feet. When she plays, Mitchell will need her to have an attack mentality and get to rim or the free throw line. With her size, Campbell also serves as a great offensive option to post up smaller guards. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jasmine Ware (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Ware is another taller guard at 5’10’’ who Mitchell compared to Mason, with her high energy and defensive stopper mentality. Offensively, Ware owns the midrange game and will fit well into the system. Mitchell even called her on the level of a sophomore. So, despite being a freshman, expect Ware to make an impact on the team, especially as the team heads into conference.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Forwards</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong> Sweets Underwood (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Also a starter last season, Underwood is an extremely athletic player capable of averaging a double-double every game for UCSB. Last season, Underwood averaged 7.7 points and 7 rebounds, good enough for sixth in the Big West. She also shot a high field goal percentage, ranking third in the Big West at 46.9 percent. Underwood owns a quick 15-foot jump shot, but can also post up, which is important in UCSB’s offense, where the four and five positions are interchangeable. As for improvement, Mitchell looks to see Underwood continue to develop her passing, but overall, Underwood is a huge piece of the puzzle for UCSB.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jackie Luna-Castro (sophomore) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> While Luna-Castro is listed as a forward, she played center for UCSB last year, which probably won’t change. Last season, fans saw sparks of great potential in the young freshman, like in the Cal Poly game when she earned the start. Over the offseason, Luna-Castro has worked on her strength, but what Mitchell most hopes to see from Luna- Castro is consistency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Kendra Morrison (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Similar to Adrian from last season, Morrison is 6’1’’ and another versatile player. In her time at UCSB so far, Morrison has surprised Mitchell, who said she is “better than I thought with her IQ.” Morrison is a great passer who can also post up. Stronger than Adrian, Morrison isn’t afraid to mix it up more. Expect this freshman to find minutes on the floor.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Centers</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong> Kirsten Tilleman (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Known as a blue-collar player, Tilleman was a huge highlight last season for UCSB. As Mitchell has repeatedly stated, “we go as Tilleman goes.” As a starter, she was consistently known for her defensive play, ranking second in the Big West in rebounds at 8.4 per game and seventh in blocked shots at .9. Offensively, Tilleman is the ultimate team player and team’s best post passer. But, Tilleman became a legitimate scoring threat down the stretch of the season, averaging 9.75 points in the final 12 games. She takes advantage of the 17-foot jump shot. Playing the majority of the time on the low block last year, the Gauchos would like to take greater advantage of Tilleman’s outside game. She’s worked on leading more vocally, but Tilleman is the leader of this team.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jessica Pino (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Thus far, Pino has made her mark on the Gauchos as a hard worker and a great passer who can also shoot the 17-foot jump shot.

Davis, on the other hand, takes control of first place, improving to 8-5-4 overall and 6-2 in the conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s hard,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We’ve got a couple games left, but I don’t think we’re going to make the Big West tournament because of this and that was our goal for the year, so we feel like we’ve failed.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked like the better team the entire game and were extremely dangerous from the start, outshooting the Aggies 26 to 11.</p>\n<p>“Every game we play, it’s the same story,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “No matter how many shots you have, if you don’t put them on frame or put them in the back of the net, they don’t really count. We were hoping for that second goal, but we unfortunately didn’t get it.”</p>\n<p>In the 28th minute, UCSB finally found the back of the net on a goal from senior forward Achille Campion, who was back in the lineup for the first time since Sept. 16 due to injury. UCSB exhibited beautiful passing with junior midfielder Goffin Boyoko receiving a ball streaking towards the endline, who passed it back to Ryan in the penalty box. Ryan then sent the ball square to freshman midfielder Ema Boateng, who flicked it to Campion. Campion converted for his sixth goal of the season and give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a nice build up play,” head coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s something we hadn’t seen and something we’ve been looking for as far as combination play. It was great.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continued to dominate the possession in the first half, but went into halftime tied at one apiece due to a goal by Davis with three seconds remaining in the first half. Davis sent a ball into the box, which was headed down by junior defender Peter Schmetz. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the header went off the heel of Boyoko and landed into feet of sophomore defender Ramon Martin del Campo, who passed the ball to sophomore forward Matt Sheldon. Sheldon sent the ball across the goal and past Mansker to equalize the game.</p>\n<p>“We kept saying, we’re due to catch a break…something has to go right,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s crazy. You’d think you’d get a break on something and we didn’t get one today. [The ball] can’t go off his heel and bounce up or go somewhere else?”</p>\n<p>Entering overtime deadlocked at one goal, Sheldon came up big once again for his team. On a long throw in by the Aggies, UCSB sophomore keeper Austin Mansker came out to grab the ball, but missed. Scrambling ensued in the box. Sheldon got a shot off, which was blocked by Schmetz on the goal line. However, Sheldon converted on the rebound.Sheldon led the Aggies offensively with the two goals on four shots.</p>\n<p>“They got a throw in, which is their best way of scoring,” Ryan said. “The ball rolled to one of their players and they put it in.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos begged the referee for a foul call, claiming Mansker was pushed and that his arm was grabbed, but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>“We like to control the result, but I feel the ref took that away from us,” Ryan said. “He called a lot in the box the whole game and to let guys go up like that and hit our keeper is totally on him.”</p>\n<p>As the team started to walk off the field, senior defender Peter McGlynn pushed the ref to the ground, earning himself a red card. He was escorted off the field by UCSB police, although Vom Steeg said the referee doesn’t plan on pressing charges.</p>\n<p>“When you say, ‘well I think everything could go wrong,’ now it has,” Vom Steeg said. “I didn’t see it coming. Obviously, [his season is] done. There are lines you don’t cross, and if you cross the line, the privilege to be a Division I college athlete is gone.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s non-conference match-up against Stanford, UCSB lost 1-0 on a golden goal in overtime, the team’s second consecutive loss in extra time. With the win, the Cardinal improve to 7-7-1.</p>\n<p>“We did a lot of good things, but no one wanted to score,” Vom Steeg said. “We just didn’t put the ball in the back of the net and that’s the extent of it.”</p>\n<p>It took over 95 minutes for either team to score, with Stanford securing the win on a header from their leading scorer, Adam Jahn. Sophomore midfielder Jimmy Callinan sent a beautiful cross from about midfield into the box, which Jahn snapped into the back of the net, past sophomore keeper Austin Mansker, who had no chance of saving the shot. The goal was Jahn’s ninth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>“The only thing we discussed was the fact that the only way this team was going to score was if the ball goes wide and they cross it into the box,” Vom Steeg said. “They had two guys open on that last play, so that’s a breakdown.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos outshot the Cardinal 16-12, including 7-3 in the second half, but both team shot an even four shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think we had a whole lot of chances, but we had some good ones that would’ve allowed us to score and take the game,” Baiden said. “We aren’t taking advantage of our opportunities.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s best opportunity came in the second half with just 21 seconds remaining in regulation when senior midfielder Dion Acoff dribbled down the left sideline before cutting in and taking a shot from the center of the 18 yard box.  Unfortunately for UCSB, the shot went wide left.</p>\n<p>“It’s frustrating because we do a lot of good things and I thought we got good performances from different players, but it’s the same repeating theme — nothing on frame,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Gauchos was McGlynn, who took three shots on the evening.  In the first half, McGlynn struck a bending ball from the right side of the box that had Stanford’s keeper beat, but rolled just wide of the post.</p>\n<p>“I thought he hit three really good shots,” Vom Steeg said. The one was very unlucky that it went just wide of the post.  McGlynn, right now, is one of our better players and he’s playing at a high level.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two games of the regular season next week with Sac State on Wednesday.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48462\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48462\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/","id":1612,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1611,1610,1609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Second in Conference With Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team celebrated the Halloween weekend in high spirits after defeating rival Cal Poly in four sets Saturday night.

The Gauchos enter the weekend with a 1-2 record in MPSF play and are coming off a big 13-7 win on the road against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>In their only other meeting this season, UCSB beat Pepperdine 8-4 on Sept. 16 in the NorCal tournament. In that game, the Gauchos entered half time with a 5-2 advantage and managed to hold the lead throughout the entire game. Junior attacker Matt Gronow and sophomore utility Bryce Miller each had two goals to lead the Gauchos in scoring, while senior goalkeeper Myles Christian led the defense with 11 saves.</p>\n<p>“I think we are feeling good and confident about playing Pepperdine. They are a very active team with a couple strong outside shooters,” Christian said. “They do have a new coach who is a former national team player, so I think their style of play will be a little more standard and nothing too fancy.” Christian is coming off a career game against No. 6 UC Irvine in which he had 18 saves and held the Anteater’s high powered offense to 7 goals. With that effort, Christian further solidified his place as the third-ranked goalkeeper in the MPSF with 11.79 saves per game. Pepperdine currently ranks last in the MPSF with only 10.13 goals per game, so Christian and the rest of the Gaucho defense will have another opportunity for a big game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Meanwhile, with 17 points earned against conference opponents this season, the Mustangs are in first place in the league with an overall record of 8-6-3 and 5-1-2 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off its first conference loss against Cal State Fullerton and earning a draw against UCR, the Mustangs will try to rebound against the Gauchos. Despite being in first place, Cal Poly still has not mathematically qualified for a spot in the Big West Tournament and the Gauchos will look to play spoiler, as a loss could endanger the Mustang’s chances of competing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“They do play a system where there are some pluses and minuses for us and against us, so we’re going to do everything we can to play to our strengths and avoid those weaknesses,”</p>\n<p>Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “It’d be great [to win]. They’re our closest rival, the schools are very similar — we recruit a lot of the same players. You always want to beat your cross town rival.”</p>\n<p>A huge reason Cal Poly is in position to capture its first Big West title since 2009 is freshman goalkeeper Alyssa Giannetti, who leads the conference with 6.65 saves per game and 113 overall saves. Santa Barbara plans on creating havoc in the box for Giannetti after scoring four goals against Fullerton and outshooting Riverside 13-5 in last weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to look up some game film and we’re going to come up with a system and style that is best going to suit us to have more of the ball,” Stumpf said. “Because of that, [hopefully we will] get some momentum and get more looks at the goal and hopefully stick them away.”</p>\n<p>Containing the Cal Poly offense will be a difficult task for Santa Barbara as the Mustangs enter with the No. 1 ranked offense in the league, scoring a conference-high 1.88 goals per game and 19 goals in total. Stopping freshman forward Elise Krieghoff will be top priority for the Gaucho’s backline. Krieghoff has top rank in the Big West in goals scored with 10 on the season.</p>\n<p>Despite having to settle for a record under .500, the Gauchos are still proud of what they have accomplished this season.</p>\n<p>“I think that our entire season we played really well; our record doesn’t show how hard we worked,” Mead said. “I’m really proud of the whole effort everyone has put in and just coming together as a team. It has been a very awesome year even though the record doesn’t show it.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Sunday’s Blue-Green rivalry match is set for 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/","id":1629,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1628,1627,1626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Desperation Time: Playoffs on the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With only four games remaining in the regular season, the No. 25 UCSB men’s soccer team cannot afford to lose anymore.

The Cardinals are currently second in the Pac-12 in shots with 17.5 per game, although they only convert 1.36 goals per game. Leading the attack for Stanford is senior forward Adam Jahn with eight goals and two assists, good for second in the Pac-12. “He’s 6’3,’’ he’s active … he’s a good forward,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “He’s their go-to guy. If we want to not give up a goal, certainly keeping him from scoring will go a long way.”</p>\n<p>An offensively focused game may be exactly what UCSB needs. Struggling to score goals as of late, the Gauchos will look to take advantage of Stanford’s sub- par defense, which allows 1.43 goals per game.</p>\n<p>“This is a game for our offense. Right now, on offense, what we lack is confidence,” Baiden said. “We have to find a way to find the back of the net because that confidence will carry over to Davis and if we can get a couple early goals on Davis, [the game] will be over.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies are currently in first place in the Big West with 15 points and have won five of their last six games. They hold a 7-5-4 overall and 5-2 conference record.</p>\n<p>“The game we absolutely have to win is on Sunday,” Vom Steeg said. “We will work hard to play a number of players on Friday night because I have to have a team that’s rested enough to play on Sunday. If we win on Friday and lose Sunday, it’s a bad weekend.”</p>\n<p>At Davis almost two weeks ago, the Gauchos lost 1-0. The Aggies were able to hold UCSB offensively and eventually found a goal in the 85th minute on a free kick.</p>\n<p>Each team only took nine shots, which is about eight shots below UCSB’s average of 17.2. Davis also outshot UCSB 4-3 in shots on goal in an offensive struggle for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to attack Davis,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to take 25 shots. I even told the guys I’d like the goal to be 30 shots. We have to be able to get goals.”</p>\n<p>While Sunday’s game will feature the two best defenses in conference, with Santa Barbara ranking first in the Big West in goals against average at .82 and Davis ranking second at .95, scoring goals will be the ultimate priority for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a position where we have to take chances, take risks, be aggressive and do everything we can to find the back of the net,” Vom Steeg said. “That exposes you a little bit and you might give something in the back, but we have no choice.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday’s game against Stanford is set for 7 p.m. while Sunday’s game against Davis will start at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48437\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48437\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/","id":1643,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1642,1641,1640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks for Second Win in Blue-Green Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team has just one game this Halloween weekend, and it’s against rival Cal Poly.

McConnell had 23 kills, 26 digs, 14 blocks and had a .346 hitting percentage over the weekend. Four different players racked up double digit kills for the Mustangs against Fullerton, showing their multi-faceted attack.</p>\n<p>“They have a lot of weapons because they are playing a 6-2 offense so they will always have three hitters,” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “For us to be successful, we are going to</p>\n<p>have to play good three hitter defense all night, we will need a good offensive night and were going to have to serve.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had the same opponents as Cal Poly last weekend and split the matches, dropping to Fullerton in five sets and defeating Riverside in four. The loss to Fullerton came on a night that junior opposite Katey Thompson had to sit with a knee injury, but she returned Saturday and seems to be healthy moving forward.</p>\n<p>This is the second meeting this year between the two teams. The first came on Sept. 29 when Santa Barbara took the win on the road in three sets. Thompson recorded 15 kills and three service aces, so her presence on the court will be quite a boost to the Gaucho offense. Cal Poly could not amount much of anything against the Santa Barbara defense last month. No Mustang recorded double-digit kills and as a team they hit just .123.</p>\n<p>“We can’t really look at what happened last time. Every time we play a match it’s a new game,” Thompson said. “You can’t rely on exactly what happened the last time, because since then, they have watched a lot of tape and have studied us much more.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play host where they are 4-4 this year. The Mustangs are 0-8 on the road this year and have no wins away from home, so before heading out to an Isla Vista style Halloween weekend, stop by the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. to see UC Santa Barbara take on rival Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/ucsb-win-bluegreen-rivalry/","id":5380,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5379,5378,5377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Breathe … Believe … Battle: Kerri Walsh Jennings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"At WinForver’s most recent event last week in Los Angeles, I had the opportunity to sit down with three-time Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings.

I knew it was possible. Making it happen is another thing, but Misty and I have had a winning recipe. We knew what it took to get there and every four years we would shake things up and we’d keep growing — and that’s how you keep being successful, is evolving and getting out of your comfort zone, and we really did that.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know some people doubted you and Misty going into London, but you only dropped one set. What obstacles did you have to overcome and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The public perception of us, for sure. I’ve never been an underdog my whole life and that didn’t sit well with me. That being said, in our heads we knew when we got there that we weren’t going to be the underdogs anymore. But we have other things too … life. I have two kids now. Our responsibilities are so much more now than they had in the past. And the game had grown so much in the two years we took off, so just getting reacquainted with each other after a couple years off and getting reacquainted with beach volleyball. There were a lot of really big challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You and Misty have been unstoppable. What’s it like playing with her?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s really fun. Her skills made me better and I always wanted to be better because she always carried her weight and I wanted to make sure that I did that. It was a true joy to play with her for so long. We had an amazing ride together — not always pretty, not always effortless … never effortless really, but it was really fun to go to work with her and grow up with her really.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Misty just retired. How much longer do you plan on playing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: My goal is to play in the 2016 Olympics and win a gold medal That’s my dream. I’m going to take a year off — I’m pregnant right now — have this beautiful baby and then I feel I have three years of really good volleyball in me. I just want to keep getting better and I feel I have so much more in me. So, once I find my partner in crime, we’ll go to work and we’ll hone our team and make sure we’re on task.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You and Misty will go down as the best duo in beach volleyball, but maybe also the best in all sports. Have you taken the time to reflect on everything you guys have done?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. I think that that’s something that will come maybe when I retire. I think that I’m just so in it right now and so present. I’m so grateful for what we had together and it’s so crazy to be talking in past tense about her. It was only two months ago that we did this together. I feel like we deserve to be in that conversation, and I hope that doesn’t sound arrogant. I just know that we had something special. Jerry Rice and Joe Montana, Pippen and Jordan — all these amazing duos — we absolutely deserve to be in that conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know you played indoor volleyball at Stanford. How did you get into beach volleyball?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Right when I finished college, after the Sydney Olympics, I needed a change. The options were to go to Europe and play or to try beach and Misty May-Treanor, one of the best players in the world, was looking for a partner. It was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up, so I did a gut check, an ego check. I went through a lot of growing pains in the first year, but I stuck with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know you have a cousin in Taylor Formico at UCSB. Have you kept up with how she’s doing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s been easy to keep up with her because she’s kicking butt apparently. I’m really proud of her. She’s a fighter and her dad is one of eight kids and he’s probably the most competitive of those eight and it’s really cool to see Taylor take so much after her father, and her mother and [to] see her excel where she’s worked so hard to get where she’s at.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s it like being a professional athlete and mom?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s a dream come true. I’ve always wanted to be a working mom like my mom. I’m passionate about both things. Obviously, my family is number one and to be able to combine it with something that I’m so passionate about in my career and the sport I love is truly a dream come true and I just want to keep the ride going as long as I can be the best me.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/","id":5378,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[5377,5376,5375],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":165,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
