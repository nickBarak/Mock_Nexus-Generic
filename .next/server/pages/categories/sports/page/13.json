While it may not have been the result the Gauchos were looking for, there were many positives to take away from the game, including the team’s resiliency despite being down a goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara started the game off strong as senior forward Shaelan Murison found the back of the net two minutes into the game. Murison continues to be a nightmare for opposing teams as she is constantly putting pressure on goal. This not only forces teams to play more defensive but also allows UCSB to play more freely in the midfield area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is early, one thing that has been noticeable is the aggressive press that the Gauchos have played with. By constantly pressuring the ball, it makes it more likely for their opponents to turn the ball over, especially in their own half of the field.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the first ten minutes being dominated by Santa Barbara, Minnesota began to find their rhythm behind strong play from junior forward Makenzie Langdok. Langdok had her first shot blocked in the 19th minute but was able to put away a goal in the 18th minute to the level the matchup at 1-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a quick start, UCSB was unable to keep their momentum primarily because they were constantly being called for fouls. This ended up stagnating their counterattack and allowing Minnesota to increase their time of possession.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Langdok took advantage and scored her second goal of the match in the 57th minute behind a lazy pass in the back end by the ‘Chos. Minnesota had seemingly taken full control of the game at this point and shifted toward a defensive formation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB responded by putting constant pressure on the Golden Gopher’s goalkeeper Maddie Nielsen. Nielsen successfully blocked two Gaucho attempts but was unsuccessful in the 83rd minute as sophomore forward Jessica Wright pushed the ball through to knot things up. Neither team would be able to create many chances following this goal in either overtime, leading to the final score of 2-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was an encouraging sight for Head Coach Paul Stumpf as it is clear that this squad not only competes at a high level but also has the maturity to not panic when things are not going their way. There were a couple instances where this was clear but one in particular was when the ‘Chos were constantly being called for fouls throughout the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than allow this to take themselves out of the game mentally, Santa Barbara was able to keep their composure, a characteristic that will be necessary to maintain for UCSB to make a run for the Big West Title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up for UCSB will be a matchup against San Jose State, who are also coming off of a draw against Cal Poly. The Spartans are led by Jamilecxth Becerra who finished last season with a team-leading five goals. For the Gauchos to have success in this matchup, it will be important that the defense shadows Becerra as she is extremely dangerous in the penalty box area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In front of goal for the Spartans is sophomore Ariana Romero who recently transferred from Seattle University. In her first start for SJSU, Romero had an impressive three saves which helped lead to a clean sheet. UCSB will need to constantly put pressure on goal in their upcoming matchup to take Romero out of her comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will look to get their first win of the season at home this Sunday against SJSU at 12 p.m. inside Harder Stadium. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89641\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-23/gauchos-tie-with-golden-gophers-in-double-overtime-thriller/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89641\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-23/gauchos-tie-with-golden-gophers-in-double-overtime-thriller/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-23/gauchos-tie-with-golden-gophers-in-double-overtime-thriller/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-23/gauchos-tie-with-golden-gophers-in-double-overtime-thriller/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-23/gauchos-tie-with-golden-gophers-in-double-overtime-thriller/","id":1315,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1314,1313,1312],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2019-20 Season Preview: Women’s Volleyball Team Hoping to Turn Individual Accolades Into Team Success","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2019-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team are hoping that their combination of young talent and experienced veterans will lead them to their first Big West title since 2013.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_85075\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"810582656\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89632\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85075\" data-attachment-id=\"85075\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/freshman-setter-olivia-lovenburgs-immediate-impact/olivia-lovenburg-sets-for-zoe-fleck-angie-banks-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Olivia Lovenburg sets for Zoe Fleck.

Ruddins led the Big West in total kills and kills per set at 587 and 5.34 respectively, while Petrachi found herself at the top in both digs and digs per set at 555 and 4.96 in her senior year.</p>\n<p>The story here is that the 2018-19 Gauchos were able to rebound after a tough 2017-18 season which saw a measly 8-20 record overall and a 7-9 record in conference play. The rebound was a team effort that featured top-level contributions from a variety of positions and experience levels.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were ultimately invited to the National Invitational Volleyball Championship after finishing 9-7 in league play and winning their last three games, including two back-to-back sweeps.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 9-7 league record was their best since the 2013 season and they will be looking to improve as they begin the 2019-20 season this weekend.</p>\n<p>It should be an uphill battle though, as conference rivals Cal Poly, Hawai’i and UC Irvine finished last season with conference records of 15-1, 14-2 and 10-6 respectively.</p>\n<p>An eleven-game stretch near the start of the season features one matchup with Irvine and two with Hawai’i, as well as two Blue-Green rivalries. That means five of those eleven games will be against last year’s top three conference teams including UCSB’s archrival. This stretch also features two matchups with UC Davis and two with Long Beach State, the two schools who finished just below UCSB in the Big West standings. UCSB split the two-game series with both schools last year.</p>\n<p>This stretch will almost guarantee UCSB’s position as an elite club or expose the team as a one-season wonder.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to be especially careful not to let their emotions get the best of them in the games against Cal Poly, as the Mustangs’ defense was frustrating to play against last year and their offense was efficient.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s Torrey Van Winden led the Big West in hitting percentage at .365 while teammate Meredith Phillips was ranked fourth with a .328. The Big West’s leader in blocks per set was also led by Mustang Madilyn Mercer who posted a 1.12. Not a single Gaucho was in the top five of either category.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s stingy defense and crazy efficient offense catapulted them to a 15-1 conference record and a 25-3 overall.</p>\n<p>Individual efforts were the premier highlights for the Gauchos in 2018-19, and they will be looking to put it all together into team success this season. The Blue-Green matchup will showcase some of the league’s best talents as well the Big West’s fiercest rivalry. Each game will be a must-watch.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos begin the season on Friday, Aug. 23 with a home scrimmage against CSU Bakersfield. Regular season play begins on Friday, Aug. 30 when UCSB travels to Boulder to take on Long Island University in the Colorado Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

After a successful season last year in which the Gauchos finished with an overall record of 13-7-1, Head Coach Paul Stumpf will look to increase his team’s win total with an extremely well-rounded squad.</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a quick start last year as they began the season on a five-game win streak. Of those five matchups, the ‘Chos were able to keep a clean sheet in three of them. This was a major trend throughout last season as the Gauchos did not give up more than three goals in any game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Much of this success can be attributed to senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese, who came off the bench against Cal early in the season to help lead Santa Barbara to the win. Gaucho fans can expect DeWeese to be a force in front of the goal who will make her opponents earn their goals. After finishing last year with 60 saves and a save percentage of 80%, there is a lot of excitement around her potential for this upcoming season.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, UCSB will be led by senior forward Shaelan Murison, who was recently named to the Big West preseason All-Conference Team. Murison was fantastic last year as she finished with 10 goals and four assists. In order for Santa Barbara to improve offensively, it will be crucial for Murison to not only provide veteran leadership but also create opportunities for her teammates as well.</p>\n<p>Although Murison will be key to the offensive attack, she will surely be double-teamed which means that her teammates must step up as well. Senior forward Katherine Sheehy seems to be a player that could potentially have a breakout year and help ease the pressure off of Murison. Sheehy is a playmaker and will look to push the ball with pace on the counter attack to catch opponents in a poor position defensively.</p>\n<p>For UCSB to compete for the Big West Title, the squad will need to have more of a balanced attack on the offensive side of the field. Last season, Murison had a total of a 100 shots with her next closest teammate coming in with only 19 shots.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara to have a chance to compete against the top teams in the country, other players must step up as opposing teams will place all their attention on Murison. That being said, there is strong optimism within the program that players like Sheehy will provide production offensively to make the team even more dynamic.</p>\n<p>With respect to this year’s schedule, there is one matchup in particular that Gaucho fans should be excited about, which is a home game against the California Golden Bears on Aug. 30. In last year’s contest, UCSB won in a thriller by a score of 3-2 behind strong play from DeWeese. Cal will surely be out for revenge in this game, making it a very intriguing matchup.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has already started this season strong in terms of exhibition games as they beat Westmont by a score of 2-0. Murison was able to break through in the 26th minute and junior midfielder Angelica Ortega added on with a goal in the 40th minute. With this game in control fairly early, UCSB was able to play more of their younger players to get them real game experience, which could prove to be important later down the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to keep up their winning ways against Minnesota this upcoming Thursday at home in Harder Stadium at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

of their run this past year as they begin their quest for the 2019-20 Big West title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos finished the 2018-19 season in second place in the Big West with a 4-2-1 conference, 10-6-2 overall record. They both started and ended the season on a three-game win streak, yet close losses in the middle would come back to bite them as they ended just one game out of first place, and with a tough first-round matchup in the conference tournament against Cal State Fullerton. For the second year in a row, UCSB would go on to lose their first game of the tourney at home, this time a missed penalty kick away from advancing.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the Gauchos do have plenty to be optimistic about. One of the keys to success in any college sport is continuity, and the Gauchos are returning with a strong core including players such as senior defender Faouzi Taieb, senior midfielder Thibault Candia, and junior forward Rodney Michael. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taieb has been a key component in the Gauchos’ defensive and offensive gameplans ever since he transferred from St. Francis Brooklyn a year ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He tallied the most minutes on the team last year with 1642, and started every match he played. The French defender plays such a huge role because of his ability to not just orchestrate the defense, but also because of his nose for the ball on set-pieces. Whether it be his game-winning tap-in last year against Gonzaga, or his header in UCSB’s exhibition win over Westmont last weekend, Taieb’s physical strength and knack for being in the right place at the right time makes him one of the most dangerous players on the field when it’s time for a free kick. His production has made it possible for UCSB to almost depend on set-pieces as the primary form of goal-scoring however, which is an issue I’ll get back to a little later on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving to the middle of the field, fellow transfer Candia has developed into one of the top playmakers in the entire conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candia’s seven assists led the Big West last year and he has the sole assist of this season for the Gauchos in their win against the Warriors. The Parisian midfielder has been a mastermind on offense for UCSB, earning a Big West Player of the Week award last season and notching a game-winning goal against UC Davis as well. He’s usually all over the attacking third, mixing curled long balls with quick through passes that keep the defense on their feet. He is also the free-kick taker for the Gauchos, who as I mentioned before are one of if not the most lethal teams in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, star forward Michael has re-energized and added a new dimension to UCSB’s offense. While his accolades (2018 All-Big West First Team, 2018 All-Far West Region Team, and 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year, to name a few) speak for themselves, you really don’t understand just how quick and skilled Michael is until you see it with your own eyes. The junior commands a double team in almost every game, and still manages to burst through the backline and score, as evidenced by his team-leading 17 goals last season. The pressure he puts on defenses is unlike any other player in the conference, and he is the key piece that makes this team run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These three players are certainly invaluable to the Gauchos, but they’re not the only big names on the team. Reigning Co-Big West Freshman of the Year Ben Roach,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who is a wall of a goalkeeper; senior defender Noah Billingsley, who anchors the defense; and senior forward Sahid Conteh, who both playmakes and finishes at an elite level are just a few examples of other players who will be essential to success in the upcoming season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Gauchos will have to get over some of the hurdles that haunted them all of last season. As mentioned earlier, UCSB’s overreliance on set-pieces to produce goals extremely limited their goal-scoring ability. Far too often last year the team would get out into transition, or string together nice passes in the midfield for it to just fizzle out as they reached the attacking third. They lost four games by the score of 1-0 last season, which is unacceptable when putting out the amount of offensive talent that they do on the field. It also cheapens the impact of the amazing defense and goalkeeping that they consistently play night in and night out, and allows teams to stick around that they should beat handily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also have to make sure to maintain their composure as the season goes on. They received five yellow cards and a red already in their exhibition match against Westmont, and they just can’t afford to shoot themselves in the foot because of their temper. Finding that middle ground between playing with passion and losing control can be difficult, but the Gauchos will need to keep it cool in order to get far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This next stretch of non-conference games, including matchups against big teams such as Virginia Tech, UC Berkeley and Gonzaga, will give UCSB a good opportunity to get back into playing shape and get some positive momentum going into the conference season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Big West play starts, the two Blue-Green Rivalry games against Cal Poly, which they play at Harder Stadium on Oct. 5 and Alex G. Spanos Stadium on Nov. 2, will of course be must-watch television. There is always no love lost between these two squads and they typically bring out the best in each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another game to circle on your calendar will be the Gauchos’ matchup with UC Irvine at home on Oct. 19. The reigning Big West Champion Anteaters are the only team in the conference to be voted into the Top 25 by the </span><a href=\"https://unitedsoccercoaches.org/rankings/college-rankings/ncaa-di-men/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Soccer Coaches Preseason Poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and will give UCSB a great opportunity to measure themselves against some of the top talent in the country.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

history. The team finished with an 18-8 record overall, while going 3-1 against Golden Coast Conference opponents. The Gauchos earned the No. 4 ranking in the country after several notable wins against teams like Long Beach State, Pepperdine and UC Irvine. UCSB saw great success last year thanks to their skilled offensive attack and the team’s unified defense. The Gauchos will look to ride that momentum entering the 2019 season.</p>\n<p>Hoping to end the season strong, the Gaucho’s final home game against rival Pepperdine was unfortunately canceled because of the tragic fires that raged down the Southern California coast. Entering the 2019 season, men’s water polo should continue to rack up W’s and climb the ranks, after losing only one senior.</p>\n<p>Entering this 2019 season, the Gaucho’s will be led by star senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic. Coming off of a career year in which he scored 48 goals, Gvozdanovic should continue to see offensive success in his final season at UCSB. Perhaps the part of his game that doesn’t get recognized or talked about enough is his spectacular all-around defense. Gvozdanovic is often given the responsibility of matching up against the opponent’s best scorer, and he does not usually disappoint. Last season he led the team in steals, tallying 37 swipes in only 26 games played.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Another player to look out for this season is the third-year big man out of Chicago, Illinois: Mason McQuet. The 6’3” and 200-pound center defender has turned heads in his first two seasons for his solid all-around game and tenacious defense. Mcquet is well known for his tremendous work ethic in the weight room and the classroom, and it shows in his efficient yet gritty style of play. McQuet should see an increased role amongst the team’s minutes rotation as he enters his third season.</p>\n<p>Lastly, watch out for second year transfer student Danny Roland. The 6’3” sophomore out of San Rafael, California transferred from UCLA, the team that won the 2017 NCAA championship. Roland has quick hands and very strong legs, allowing him to cover shooting angles and pick up saves. Roland played for a very well-respected NorCal club team known as SHAQ (Sleepy Hollow Aquatic Club). His time in the club pipeline has helped prepare him to compete against the high-level athletes at the D-1 level.</p>\n<p>Difficult matchups dot the UC Santa Barbara schedule. UCSB is scheduled to play nine games against teams that finished last season ranked in the top 20 nationally, including one game against each member of last year’s top four. Those four — USC, Stanford, UCLA, and Cal — were responsible for  seven of UCSB’s  eight losses last year, so there will be opportunities for both revenge and resume building.</p>\n<p>The top-ranked team on the UCSB schedule, however, is Golden Coast Conference foe Pepperdine, who visit Campus Pool on Sept. 19. Just under a month later, on Oct. 6, the Gauchos will play host to USC, the defending national champions. The Trojans roughed up UC Santa Barbara in two separate games last season, so the early October clash will serve as a test of UCSB’s mettle heading into the bulk of conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on each one of their conference foes after facing USC, beginning with the University of the Pacific on Oct. 19 and ending with Pepperdine, again, on Nov. 16. Pacific was the only non-top five team to beat UCSB last season, setting up the game at Campus Pool as another chance for UC Santa Barbara revenge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Junior midfielder Athena Kuehn, junior midfielder Celina Nummerdor, and senior defensemen Nikki Albrecht will be tasked with leading the Golden Gophers back to the tournament this year. Last season, the trio combined to miss only one game the entire season and totalled three goals and twelve points during that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to watch on the Golden Gophers is junior goalkeeper Maddie Nielsen. Nielsen played in all 23 games and finished fourth in the Big Ten with 77 saves to go along with 9 shutouts, a number that ranked second in the conference. It will be fascinating to see how Nielsen will continue to improve throughout this season, but for now she will be tasked with stopping the offensive onslaught of the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara and Minnesota have met three times prior to Thursday’s action, with Minnesota taking each of the first two contests in 2010 and 2011, before falling to the Gauchos 1-0 in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Chos will look to take the momentum from their 2-0 exhibition win over Westmont on Saturday and translate it to success against a superior opponent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the offensive end it will most likely be senior Shaelan Murison who leads the charge for UCSB. Based on what we saw in the match against Westmont, Murison will be getting a lot of touches and taking the bulk of the shots for the Gauchos. This likely trend would be no surprise as just a season ago, Murison lead all Big West players in shot attempts by nearly double, and her 10 goals ranked second in the conference. Senior forward Katherine Sheehy will also be highly involved on offense based on her stats from a season ago, where she finished second in the Big West with five assists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the defensive side of the field, senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese is the player to watch. In 2018, DeWeese proved herself to be an elite keeper when she allowed only 15 goals on the season, good enough to rank second among all goalkeepers in the Big West. Her .800 save percentage and .94 average goals-against also placed in the top three in the Big West. DeWeese will look to take the next step in her senior year and compete for the Big West’s goalkeeper of the year award. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to keep your eye on in this season-opener is Lauren Hess. Hess was named to the All-Freshman team in 2018 as a defender after seeing the field in all 21 games and making an impact on a team that came very close to the NCAA tournament. On Thursday it will be interesting to see how Hess has improved during the off-season and if her role has expanded at all after a stellar freshman campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game will be played at 7:00 p.m. on Thursday at Harder Stadium.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89571\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-21/ucsb-hosts-minnesota-in-first-regular-season-matchup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89571\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-21/ucsb-hosts-minnesota-in-first-regular-season-matchup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-21/ucsb-hosts-minnesota-in-first-regular-season-matchup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-21/ucsb-hosts-minnesota-in-first-regular-season-matchup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-21/ucsb-hosts-minnesota-in-first-regular-season-matchup/","id":1310,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1309,1308,1307],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Well-Rounded Gauchos Cruise to 2-0 Win Over Westmont","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2019-08-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos' efficient offense and stalwart defense led to a shutout 2-0 victory over Westmont in their last exhibition game of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79023\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1712818441\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89557\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79023\" data-attachment-id=\"79023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/gauchos-remain-winless-in-conference-play-following-1-1-draw-against-csun/lynsee-voss-races-for-possession-of-the-ball-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lynsee Voss races for possession of the ball.

The Gauchos’ offense relentlessly attacked the opposition and their defense limited the Warriors’ goal-scoring attempts in a great all-around effort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB got out and attacked early, as they put seven shots on goal in the first 22 minutes of action before senior Shaelan Murison got behind the keeper and scored to put the Gauchos on the board first in the 26th minute. Santa Barbara did not have to wait long to get some more offensive production as they extended their lead thanks to junior Angelica Ortega’s goal at the 40-minute mark, assisted by sophomore forward Jessica Wright. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos coasted into halftime with a comfortable lead and a dominant half of soccer under their belt. UCSB’s ten shots compared to only one for Westmont showed the clear advantage that the Gauchos held on both sides of the ball and it was a trend that continued for the rest of the game as Westmont only managed one shot on goal for the entire match.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head Coach Paul Stumpf used this exhibition as an opportunity to spread around the playing time amongst players, and with a comfortable 2-0 lead, it proved to be the perfect time to get some of the reserves and younger players into the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first major substitution made came right after the half, as sophomore Natalie Hill relieved the starting goalkeeper, senior Hanna DeWeese. Hill remained in goal for about 23 minutes before freshman keeper Evann Smith relieved her and played out the final 22 minutes, where she recorded the team’s only save of the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the starters remained in the game until the 54th minute, when Stumpf pulled them all to get other players some minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont was able to keep the game somewhat interesting as they outshot the UCSB reserves 4-1 in the final 36 minutes of action, but they could not turn any of those opportunities into goals and time expired to give the Gauchos the 2-0 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murison lead the way for the Gauchos with a game-high eight shots, six shots on goal, and one goal that gave Santa Barbara an early lead. Wright finished second on the team with four shots, two on goal, and she assisted on the Gauchos second and final goal of the game. Ortega scored the second goal of the game in the 40th minute, and it was one of her two shots on the day, with both of them being on goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Westmont, there were not many shots to be had on offense, as the Gaucho defense gave them trouble all game, and senior Maddi Berthoud was the only Westmont player to have more than one shot attempt, with two. Midfielder Brooke Porter was the only Warrior to take a shot on goal, and her attempt in the 85th minute was blocked by Smith of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont’s junior goalie Gabi Haw probably had the busiest day out of any player who took the field, as she had to defend the 16 Gaucho shots and 11 shots on goal.

Westmont held strong however, and came out of the gates playing an extremely physical style of defense that actually managed to stifle the Gauchos for most of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This aggressiveness came back to bite them pretty quickly however, as in the 9th minute of the game a questionable foul call on the Warriors gave the Gauchos a free kick about 22 yards out from goal. Senior midfielder Thibault Candia stepped up and sent a perfectly curled ball to the back post which senior defender Faouzi Taieb headed home after leaping over the Westmont defense, giving UCSB and Taieb their first goal of the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the first half wore on, a couple of patterns began to emerge that would continue to play out until the final whistle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos would typically maintain possession on their side of the pitch, but just couldn’t complete the final pass once they got into the attacking third. Westmont was more than happy to stay back and aggressively cut off passing lanes hoping to create some fast-break opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One such opportunity arose in the 20th minute when Warriors’ midfielder Jose Vargas intercepted a sloppy clearance by senior Kaya Fabretti on the Gauchos’ side of the pitch. Vargas seemed to have a clear path to goal but Fabretti raced back to make a tackle and eventually push the ball up-field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB just seemed to be a step too slow throughout the whole game, although how much of it was rust and how much was simply underestimating their NAIA opponent can’t really be calculated, and the Westmont D led by the stone wall that is senior defender Tim Heiduk made sure that openings were few and far between in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out of the locker room in the second half with a revamped intensity, partially sparked by the play of freshman Lucas Gonzalez. The LA Galaxy Academy product was all over the pitch in his first official game for UCSB, playing with not just energy but also a surprising composure that will potentially earn him more minutes as the season wears on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez set up Candia with a beautiful pass in the 48th minute that led to a cross into the middle that was easily cleared by a Warrior defender. This clearance would prove to be significant however, as it went out to Westmont’s Justin Nakaoka who was then fouled and shoved by Kaya Fabretti. A small scuffle ensued when Jose Vargas came running and shoved senior forward Ignacio Tellechea to the ground, and eventually Fabretti, Vargas and Tellechea all received yellow cards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scuffle seemed to serve as a spark plug for both teams, as the intensity of the match drastically increased right after. This culminated into one of the more exciting sequences in the game in the 70th minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont midfielder Samuel Toscano intercepted a bad pass in the back-half and streaked across to the right side of the box leaving nobody between him and UCSB goalie Alan Carrillo. He then sent a wild cross in that somehow ended up at the feet of Rodney Michaels, who took the ball the entire length of the pitch the other way and sent a perfect pass to a wide-open forward Carter Clemmenson who banged the ball off the near post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the last twenty minutes did have a few close opportunities for both teams, the most interesting part might have been junior defender Omari Fontes’ five minutes of action. He entered in the 80th minute, received a questionable yellow card for a seemingly mundane tackle one minute later, then was ejected in the 85th minute after getting another yellow card for shoving a Westmont player in the back. The Gauchos were then forced to play out the rest of the game with ten men, but they eventually came out with the win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s tough to draw too many conclusions from an exhibition match but UCSB does need to be weary of a few things moving forward. Problems with creating goals and finishing offensive sequences in the final third have haunted this team since last season, and were a big reason that they couldn’t advance further in the Big West Tournament. While rust and a lack of chemistry definitely played a role in this last game, there will have to be a quick return to form for the Gauchos as they prepare for a tough upcoming slate of games including matchups against UNLV, CAL, Virginia Tech, and Gonzaga.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Santa Barbara is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looking to build off of their successful campaign last year as they finished the year with a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record of 13-7-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Westmont Warriors began their season this past Thursday when they fell to Southern Oregon by a score of 2-1. Despite a hot start with senior midfielder Brooke Porter scoring in the eighth minute of the contest, the Warriors gave up two second-half goals and were unable to get </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the equalizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Warriors are led by junior goalkeeper Gabi Haw, who is the reigning Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) Co-Player of the year. She finished with four saves against Southern Oregon. Senior forward Maddi Berthoud and sophomore midfielder Teagan Matye have led the offensive attack for Westmont and will look to make more of an impact this upcoming Saturday.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the result will not count toward the Gauchos’ overall record, it will be crucial </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for Santa Barbara to remain focused and play hard as they develop an identity for this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of hype around this Gauchos’ squad as they have been picked to finish second in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Big West Conference this upcoming season. Many attribute this to senior forward </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shaelan Murison, who finished last year with ten goals. In order for the ‘Chos to have </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">success this year, they will look to Murison to finish off scoring opportunities in addition to being a playmaker for her teammates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With seven starters returning for Santa Barbara, there is a sense that the team will be able </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to build on their chemistry from last season. One of the biggest returners is senior </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese is the anchor of the Gauchos’ defense and has proven </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to be a force in front of the goal with her quick instincts and decisive decision-making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the return of several starters, there are a couple of newcomers who will surely have </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a role this upcoming season. Junior defender Emma Vanderhyden seems to be a popular </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">choice for being the player who could potentially have the biggest impact early on in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eastern Washington transfer has already played two years at the collegiate l</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evel, making it seem likely that she will be in the starting lineup. UCSB will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">look to Vanderhyden to stabilize the back end of the field and slow down the transition </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">counters by their opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to improve from last season, it will be key for them to continue to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow on the offensive end of the field. With Murison most likely to be doubled by the Warriors when she enters the box area, it will be crucial for other Gauchos to step up and find the back of the net. This will not only take pressure off of Murison but also give the other Gauchos the confidence to know that they are  just as capable to score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB is able to play each game with consistent energy and attention to detail, they will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not only have a chance to win most of their games but potentially win the Big West as well. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the team is composed of both veterans and young talent, many believe this will be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the year the Gauchos win the conference title. Head coach Paul Stumpf will surely look to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his seniors to provide leadership for his younger players on the pitch as well, especially in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">times of adversity during a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all starts this Saturday when the UCSB women’s soccer team faces Westmont in an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exhibition match at 5:30 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Their last meeting went heavily in favor of the home side as the Gauchos routed the Warriors by a score of 7-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB does have the historical advantage when it comes to this matchup however. As of their last meet, the Gauchos now lead the Warriors by a record of 28-24-4.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Rodney Michael will definitely be a player to keep your eye on for the Gauchos. In the 18 games he played last season, Michael contributed a team-leading total of seven goals and also threw in three assists, earning himself a spot on the 2018 All-Big West First Team and 2018 All-Far West Region First Team. Michael is primed to fill up the scoresheets once more this season as the former 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year looks to play a vital first-team role for Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the pitch, senior midfielder Thibault Candia seems to be the man pulling all the strings. The French playmaker tallied a team-leading seven assists last year, along with a goal, in the 18 games he featured in.</p>\n<p>At the backline is senior center back Faouzi Taieb, who made his presence known at both ends of the field considering he finished last season as the team’s second-highest goalscorer from a defensive position. He was also one of only three players who started all 18 games consecutively.</p>\n<p>Taieb’s potential impact for the Gauchos this season is just another exciting storyline we’ll have to wait to see unfold as the new season progresses.</p>\n<p>The kick off time is slated for 7:30 p.m. on Saturday Aug. 17, with the preseason promo including schedule posters and post-game autographs for fans.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89551\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89551\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/","id":1337,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1336,1335,1334],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Kick Off Season With Exhibition Match in LA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2019-08-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's soccer team is set to start off their 2019 campaign with an exhibition match against Cal State Los Angeles this Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79385\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1074029026\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89546\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79385\" data-attachment-id=\"79385\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/womens-soccer-ends-season-with-1-1-tie-versus-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/christine-maurer-fights-for-the-ball-hallie-browndaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christine Maurer fights for the ball.

That loss solidified their season record at a respectable 13-7-1 overall and 5-2-1 in Big West play. The Gauchos graduated 13 seniors from last year including three All-Conference contributors whose roles still need to be filled. But even with the departure of several key contributors, the Gauchos were still picked to finish second in the conference according to the Big West coaches poll that was released earlier this week. This exhibition provides a perfect opportunity to see how the players are fitting into their new roles and what the current rotations look like as we move closer to the start of the regular season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the biggest storyline to keep an eye on as we head into another year of Gaucho soccer is the return of Shaelan Murison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senior forward is coming off of a First Team All-Conference selection last season, as well as a preseason All-Conference selection heading into this year. Murison started all 21 games for the Blue and Gold a season ago, leading the team in goals with 10, points with 24, as well as game-winning goals, of which she had five. As the best returning player on a talented team, Murison will be responsible for a lot of the offensive production this year, but she will also have to take on a larger leadership role as one of the six seniors on this Gaucho squad. In this season-opener against Cal State LA, she will likely take her first steps toward getting used to her increased role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to look out for in this exhibition is senior midfielder Lynsee Voss, whose three goals a season ago puts her behind Murison for the second most goals scored among returning players. Voss appeared in 16 games and started in 14, and both of those numbers should increase this season along with her role within the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior midfielder Christine Maurer, who, despite only scoring two goals last season, finished second on the team in shots and shots on goal, with 41 and 19 respectively, could be another key cog for UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just a few adjustments and some off-season improvement we might see Maurer take a big leap this year in terms of offensive efficiency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will also get our first look at some of the 14 freshmen that will be donning the Gaucho uniform for the first time this Friday. The competition between newcomers for playing time is sure to be fierce and this match could be a determining factor in who wins a starting spot for Santa Barbara’s season opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this matchup might have no actual bearing on the upcoming season, there’s bound to be many interesting smaller takeaways as we get to see the team in action for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will take on Cal State LA at Jesse Owens Stadium on Friday at 6 p.m.. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89546\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89546\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/","id":1334,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1333,1332,1331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"U.S. Soccer’s Megan Rapinoe: The Hero Our Democracy Deserves","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2019-08-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0665-e1565647431335.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0665-e1565647431335.jpg?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opinion editor and newly converted footy fan Harper Lambert on how the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup lent her a new perspective on patriotism.

These were the icons proudly displayed by the neo-Nazis and white nationalists who crawled out of the woodwork and into Trump’s rallies in 2016. With MAGA supporters chanting “Build the wall!” in one breath and “USA! USA!” in the next, the line between patriotism and nationalism was blurry, at least in the public’s perception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two years later, in 2019, not much had changed. After watching “</span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/fahrenheit-11-9-movie-review-725858/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fahrenheit 11/9</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Michael Moore’s 2016 election documentary, I lay face down on the couch, cynicism coursing through my veins. The sea of devastated faces at Clinton campaign headquarters; the corruption festering in our voting system; Obama drinking the water in Flint — these images leached away what little remained of my faith in this democracy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, I sat in the same spot, a crowd screaming “USA! USA!” on TV again. Only this time, it wasn’t at a Trump rally. It was at a soccer game in Lyon, France.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A soccer dropout at age 10, I’d never had much interest in “the beautiful game.” I would rather watch “Bend It Like Beckham” than sit field-side at my siblings’ matches. Yet I found myself caught up in the excitement of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, mesmerized not only by the U.S. team’s athletic prowess, but also by the players themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media fed my newfound obsession. I delighted in the training camp vlogs (including one that was </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEbylhNxVZk&amp;t=1s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filmed at UCSB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), player biographies and compilations of funny moments featured on U.S. Soccer’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ussoccerdotcom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I watched these women dominate on the field, crack jokes, work out and sing on buses, cars and planes. Camaraderie was essential to their game: these players were fiercely competitive and fiercely loving of both their sport and one another. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I read about their </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fight for gender parity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, my admiration grew. Players like Alex Morgan have </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfM0LT_TUNQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spoken</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about how beating the drum increases the pressure to win. Yet not once have they folded — not against the U.S. Soccer Federation, which </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/why-the-us-national-womens-soccer-team-is-suing/585202/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pays female athletes nearly a third of what it pays males</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, despite the women’s team consistently outperforming the men’s and generating considerably more revenue — and certainly not against the competition. The team’s victory in the final match amplified the chants of “EQUAL PAY! EQUAL PAY!” that rang throughout Stade de Lyon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feud between Trump and the team, which erupted </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/sports/trump-megan-rapinoe-tweet.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, could not have been more symbolic of the political moment. About halfway through the tournament, a reporter for the soccer magazine Eight by Eight asked co-captain Megan Rapinoe whether or not the team planned to visit the White House if they won. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infinitely more American than the “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> old days</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team’s vision of progress.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not going to the fucking White House,” Rapinoe </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/8by8mag/status/1143595809910530048\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot back</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The next day, Trump </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1143892328236687361\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retorted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with, “Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!” Their 2-0 victory in the Cup final — including a goal by Rapinoe — spoke for itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which brings me to the centerpiece of my fascination: the lavender-haired winner of the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards, the undisputed star of the World Cup and the new face of women’s soccer, Megan Anna Rapinoe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though her fame reached new heights during this summer’s World Cup, Rapinoe has been a leader on and off the field for years. In 2016, she was one of five players to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">file a federal complaint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the U.S. Soccer Federation for wage discrimination and is one of 28 plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed three months before the 2019 Cup. She also sparked controversy for </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/soccer/uswnts-megan-rapinoe-kneels-during-national-anthem-solidarity-colin-kaepernick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kneeling during the national anthem</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of Colin Kaepernick at a Seattle Reign game in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties,” Rapinoe said afterwards. “It’s important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team spokesperson, Rapinoe leads with grace and an effervescent sense of humor. She doesn’t talk trash — not even about the head of the U.S. Soccer Federation, Carlos Cordeiro, who was </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5623697/us-soccer-equal-pay-megan-rapinoe/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">booed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the crowd at the team’s post-victory New York City ticker-tape parade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think he’s with us. I think he’s on the right side of things. I think he’s going to make things right,” she said. “We look forward to holding those feet to the fire.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a rousing victory </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEfeFJlwUyQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Rapinoe addressed, among other things, the diversity of the team: “We have pink hair and purple hair. We have tattoos, dreadlocks. We’ve got white girls, black girls and everything in between. Straight girls, gay girls.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Observing the reactions of the crowd, itself a mishmosh of young and old, white, brown and black, I cannot overstate the importance of this message. Highlighting this intersection of identities is not just preaching to the liberal choir or a PR stunt. The U.S. women’s national team paints a far more accurate picture of America than the almost exclusively white-male Trump administration does. Its players embody the values of compassion, honor and resilience that are so lacking in our national politics. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Rapinoe’s dissent — and absolute kickassery — is a form of patriotism that I can get behind.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it essential that Americans see themselves in this team but also that the world see </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this team. Broadcasted on hundreds of networks and reaching a record number of viewers (approximately </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48882465\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) worldwide, the World Cup winning team represented an America that other parts of the world may not otherwise get to see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infinitely more American than the “</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/27/in-good-old-days-donald-trump-says-campaign-protesters-got-more-than-just-an-escort-out/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good old days</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team’s vision of progress. “This is my charge to everyone: We have to be better. We have to love more, hate less. We’ve got to listen more and talk less,” Rapinoe said as she neared the end of her speech. “It’s our responsibility to make the world a better place.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Team USA’s triumph, much champagne was spilled and “We Are the Champions” sang. But their victory was a celebration of female friendship, sportsmanship and hard work, rather than the boastful nationalism that often colors patriotic rhetoric. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I love watching these athletes play, I value them more for what they inspire. And I don’t just mean the children who dream of going pro — that doesn’t account for their devoted fan base or the millions who tuned in to watch the World Cup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They inspire me to make the most of the platform I have to advocate for what I believe in. I may be too far gone for the soaring idealism of the American dream, but Megan Rapinoe’s dissent — and absolute kickassery — is a form of patriotism that I can get behind. Her courage moves me profoundly, evoking the same feeling the national anthem used to, the feeling of belonging to something bigger than myself — if not to a country, than to a dream. I am learning that the two are not mutually exclusive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fall, I will be studying abroad. I used to joke that when asked where I’m from, I’ll just say “California” to avoid being associated with Trump’s America.

end about a week and a half after starting on June 30.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first day of free agency alone, almost three billion dollars of money were inked in contracts across the league as a whole. Some of these were expected contracts, like the 76ers giving its budding superstar Ben Simmons a max extension and the Warriors giving Klay Thompson a max contract as well. Other deals were a lot less expected, like Jimmy Butler signing with the Heat and Al Horford signing a four-year 110 million dollar deal from the 76ers as he approaches age 34.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we get to the absolute shocker, the deal so unexpected some consider it to be downright blasphemous: Kawhi Leonard signing the max with the Clippers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fairness, Kawhi Leonard signing with the Clippers is not the issue here. He is an eligible free agent and can exercise his right to sign with a new team. The issue comes because he recruited a second star, Paul George from the OKC Thunder, to join him in LA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After trying to get Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to join him on the Clippers to no avail (both of whom signed with Brooklyn promptly at the start of free agency), Leonard convinced a player who finished third in MVP voting and who just had his career-best year to leave his team while under a three-year contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as the deal ended, everyone called foul.Paul George forced his way out of Indiana, Leonard had his drama with San Antonio two years later, Anthony Davis created a commotion in NOLA to be traded to the Lakers earlier this year, and now Paul George yet again forced his way out of another team in OKC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The increased player movement seen in the last decade has been a controversial topic amongst NBA fans. When I say player movement, I’m not referring to teaming up in free agency; I’m specifically referring to under-contract players who force their team’s hand in an attempt to leave their respective organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fans are pro-player and feel it is well within a player’s right to leave their current team if he does not want to be there any more. Their reasoning is that when teams trade players away it’s considered a business move and when players leave, it should be seen in a similar light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other fans, however, are less in favor of the players, citing that large-market teams are usually the continued benefactors of this movement, relegating the smaller markets to be in the background of the league. New Orleans was an irrelevant team until they landed generational talent, Anthony Davis. But Davis forced his way out of NOLA to the Lakers, who have been a major market since the beginning of basketball itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) has provisions to try to incentivize players to stay loyal to a franchise with large monetary benefits the incumbent teams can present </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> however, in this free agency alone, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard gave up a combined 200 million dollars in financial benefits by moving to their new respective teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s very apparent that for the elite-level players, the financial incentives presented by the CBA are not enough to mitigate their movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So where do we go from here? NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been vocal in trying to explore new incentives and methods to mitigate the current level of player movement. Prominent media members are split on the issue and some have called for radical changes, like having players not be trade eligible for X number of years after signing to prevent them from forcing their way out.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halting player movement entirely isn’t ideal either. Player movement adds a necessary intrigue to the league but the current level has shifted the landscape of the NBA too drastically and too often to allow it to continue at this level. Although it is unlikely that any rules to stop the phenomenon will come soon, be on the lookout for some big changes to come in the upcoming years. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/","id":47,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[46,45,44],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How the West Stacks Up: Conference Seeding Predictions","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-07-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/66853598_1941837039249998_4199435760069246976_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/66853598_1941837039249998_4199435760069246976_n.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Here are the favorites even amongst a high-parity Western Conference.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"269763473\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89332\"><img data-attachment-id=\"89333\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/western_conference_nba_logo_2018/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?fit=2400%2C1320&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1320\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Western_Conference_(NBA)_logo_2018\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?fit=888%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89333\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?resize=888%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"488\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the NBA free agency frenzy coming to an end, NBA teams and fans alike can start looking toward the upcoming season.

Jerry West took an already stellar defensive team and added the two best defensive wings in the game. They are the favorites to win it all and it is very clear why.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 2 Seed: Denver Nuggets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nuggets looked like a strong team that fought and clawed its way to the No. 2 seed this prior season with a very young roster. Eventually losing in the second round in a game seven, the Nuggets added depth and athleticism with Jerami Grant. The team performed phenomenally. However, with no set small forward in their rotation and the defensive issues from starting point guard Jamal Murray, there are concerns that need to be addressed going into the next season. The Denver squad will be a very good team, but are still one or two years off from being a true contender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 3 seed: LA Lakers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakers on paper look like a very scary team. An Anthony Davis and LeBron James pick and roll is every team’s worst nightmare, especially when Danny Green is spotting up for a three in the wing. Running LeBron at the point, this roster is huge and will present a lot of problems for teams offensively and on the boards. Notice how I didn’t say defensively there. With the prevalence of stretch fives, it’s not too hard to scheme around Anthony Davis’ abilities as a rim protector. In addition, DeMarcus Cousins and LeBron James leave much to be desired defensively. Going into year 17, LeBron is definitely not playing the best defense of his career and Cousins, who was always a step slower, has just suffered two major injuries to his knee and quadricep and is thus going to be a huge asterisk defensively. Davis is also known for getting knicks and knacks here and there that keep him out for short periods of time, but in this neck-and-neck Western Conference, that will cost LA some games and their seeding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 seed: Houston Rockets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Houston may have started falling apart before our very eyes after being eliminated by a Kevin Durant less Warriors team. Chris Paul and James Harden are feuding because of the playstyle they play – which favors Harden and no one else. It’s clear that the players and administration have lost all faith in Head Coach Mike D’antoni and Free Agency did not go in their favor at all as they did not sign any notable Free agents and are set to run it back with almost the same team. Here’s the catch however: GM Daryl Morey might of just saved all of their blunders by trading for a league MVP and former teammate of James Harden, Russel Westbrook. Their isolation playstyle has not panned out now 3 years in a row and is unlikely to work a 4th, but with Westbrook and Hardens pre-existing chemistry and D’antoni reverting back to his Phoenix offense rather than his current iso offense, Houston has effectively reopened their window for a championship. They switched out an aging star with injury concerns to replace him with a high octane player who has a reputation for being the ironman of the NBA. There are concerns with Westbrook’s scoring efficiency, but the elite level playmaking he brings to any squad is well worth any offensive concern one might have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 5 seed: Utah Jazz</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utah has been one very strong defensive unit that has stukk largely underperformed in the playoffs due to offensive inconsistencies. The addition of veteran Mike Conley Jr. and ISO scorer Bojan Bogdanovi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address their one glaring concern and could make Utah a dark horse threat in a close Western Conference, especially if Donovan Mitchell can take that next step and play at an all-star level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 6 seed: Portland Trail Blazers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portland was notorious as a team that did really well seeding wise but could never take that next step and convert regular-season success to playoff success. All of this changed when they made the Western Conference finals last year. They accomplished this feat without their third star Jusuf Nurki</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who suffered an injury late in the season leading up to the playoffs. So why are they seeded so low? They lost one of their key roleplayers Seth Curry in Free agency and its unlikely they get the same production from Rodney Hood going forward. Nurkic who was already a defensive liability has just taken a lower leg injury which won’t bode well defensively. The Trail Blazers 2 man duo of Lillard and McCollum can only carry this team so far on their own without a clear cut third option, and adding Hasan Whiteside who is little more than an elite rebounder does little to solve this problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7 seed: Golden State Warriors</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know what you’re saying, they made the finals the last 5 years straight how are they suddenly a 7 seed. Losing Kevin Durant is bad, especially since Klay Thompson is injured as well, but on top of this the Dubs lost backup guard Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, and Andre Iguodala. All of that and the only addition is D’angelo Russel. Yes Russel is an All Star, yes he is an exciting young player. But the fit next to Steph is frankly terrible. Both are defensive liabilities and D’angelo Russel is extremely pick and roll dependent while the Warriors run very little Pick and Roll and instead prefer a very fluid ball movement offense. Also what’s Russels fit when Klay comes back? Are Steph, Klay, and Russel going to be on the court together, if so that lineup will be extremely undersized especially compared to the rest of the Western Conference teams, which all have notable size to take advantage of smaller lineups. Furthermore the Raptors showed how easy it was to neutralize Curry when he was the sole offensive option with a Box and 1 Defense. In conclusion the warriors lost their best player to Free Agency as well as the little depth that they had to add a player who is ill fitting to their game plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 seed: Sacramento Kings</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Kings have done a lot of things right in the last few years. They got rid of bad contracts and built a deep young team from the draft and brought in pieces to facilitate their young nucleus’ growth. They have stellar perimeter play from Bogdan Bogdonovic (not to be confused with Bojan Bogdonovic), Buddy Hield, and De’aaron Fox as well as a versatile and athletic front court with Marvin Bagley III and Dewane Dedmon. This team then resigns a talented young wing in Harrison Barnes and signs veteran perimeter defender Trevor Ariza – while also adding depth to the backcourt by adding Corey Joseph. This team was trending toward a playoff berth without all of their additions, but with their recent acquisitions the Kings are poised to take the next step while also allowing their young core enough freedom to continue their development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Even Al Horford — a second-tier free agent — turned down a massive four-year offer from the Kings, opting to take less money and join a proven contender with the 76ers.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given these limitations, it’s no real surprise that the Kings received little to no media attention during the offseason; after all, the NBA is a superstar-driven league, and the Kings were (predictably) unable to grab one this offseason. But under the radar, the Kings may have had one of the smartest free agencies in recent memory, setting the team up for success in the coming years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of overpaying for a second-tier superstar, the Kings bet that their current core of De’Aaron Fox, Marvin Bagley III and Buddy Hield will take another step forward this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his jump shot is still inconsistent, Fox showed off the tantalizing skill set last year that made him the No. 5 pick two years ago. Fox averaged 17.3 points per game and 7.3 assists per game but — perhaps most importantly — shot an impressive 37% from behind the arc. If teams start to respect Fox’s jump shot, he can utilize his athleticism to get to the hoop at will.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hield, meanwhile, did his best Steph Curry impression last year, leading the team with 20.7 points per game while shooting 42% from three. One of the best pure shooters in the NBA, Hield should again provide excellent floor spacing for the Kings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being the most raw of the three, Bagley showcased his versatility and athleticism last year while only playing 25 minutes per game in his rookie season. Even without an effective jump shot, Bagley averaged almost 15 points per game — thanks in large part to his willingness to run the floor with Fox.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still a superstar league, last years’ Raptors proved the importance of depth in making a postseason run. With the skill sets of these three in mind, the Kings made a myriad of shrewd signings to provide the team with the talent and depth necessary to compete in a loaded western conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, the Kings locked up Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $85 million contract. Considering the five-year, $180 million contract Tobias Harris signed with the 76ers, this deal feels like an incredible value. Somehow, Barnes is still only 27, and in his 28 games with the Kings last year, he shot the three at almost a 41% clip. With his athleticism and size, Barnes can guard multiple positions, making him a valuable defensive asset. Most importantly, the contract is front-loaded, meaning that the Kings will have the necessary cap space to resign their big three when they hit free agency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Barnes, all of the Kings’ free agency moves revolved around creating a solid bench unit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dewayne Dedmon is a stretch five who averaged almost 11 points for the Hawks last year, displaying a natural shooting touch that should create space for the Kings’ athletic guards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trevor Ariza is a veteran who has proven his worth time and time again, and while he struggled last year with both the Suns and the Wizards, he should be more engaged on a much more competitive team. Only two years ago, Ariza proved his worth on the Rockets, and his size and acumen make him an above-average defender, as well as a solid veteran to mentor the younger players on the roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, while the signing may not be attractive, Cory Joseph will provide the Kings with a steady hand to run the second unit when Fox needs a breather. Joseph will never put up gaudy numbers, but his 3.9:1 assist-to-turnover ratio from last year shows his reliability and willingness to find open teammates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The caveat for these moves, of course, is the abundance of talent in the western conference. Even with their newfound depth, the Kings will have to battle just to make the playoffs in one of the deepest conferences in recent memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Kings made all the necessary moves to compete as a small market team. If Fox, Hield and Bagley can take a step forward, there is no reason this team can’t make the playoffs next year and even compete in a seven-game series against a top team.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
