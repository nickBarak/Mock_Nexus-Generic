What will she look like? Where did she go to school? What team will she play for?</p>\n<p>In reality, people should put these questions to rest and search no further because the best player in the women’s game is already playing.</p>\n<p>She wears No. 3 for the Phoenix Mercury, choosing the number as a freshman at UConn when college coach Geno Auriemma told her she could be the Babe Ruth of women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>He was right.</p>\n<p>After winning two NCAA titles, the UConn legend went on to win two WNBA championships, five scoring titles and two Olympic gold medals. Averaging 20.6 points per game on her career, she’s also an eight time all-star, tying Lisa Leslie for the most appearances in league history.</p>\n<p>Based on those clues, if you still don’t know who I’m referring to, this one of a kind player is Diana Taurasi.</p>\n<p>Like Mike, Taurasi makes her teammates better while knowing when to put the team on her back. She’s not only their vocal leader, but a lead by example kind of player. This season, she averaged 20.2 points and 6.2 assists per game. Last season, the only players in the NBA to accomplish these kinds of numbers were LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook and Stephan Curry. And they did it in 48 minutes; Taurasi only gets 40.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, one of the reasons that Taurasi is the WNBA’s Jordan is that she plays more like a guy. You can actually compare her. She can shoot threes from NBA range, and often does. She loves contact when driving inside and has incredible hang time for a woman.</p>\n<p>Beyond her play though, Taurasi has the mentality of a man. While she would do anything for the team, she certainly has an ego. Her fiery personality often leads to arguments with referees, which adds to her entertainment value. When you watch ‘Dee,’ you look for her to get T’d up because when she does, it usually means she’s going to go on a scoring tangent.</p>\n<p>But despite the fact that there is typically one player believed to be the best ever, there is never one player that will always be the best. Deciding the top player in any league is always controversial and there will always be a better player that comes along. Jordan is the best NBA player to play in the modern era, but there will be another, just like before Jordan there was Dr. J and Wilt Chamberlain.</p>\n<p>The game of basketball is constantly evolving and as a result, it’s impossible to compare players from different time periods. So, Taurasi is the best right now, but at some point in time, there will be a next best women’s player to play the game. She won’t necessarily be better than Taurasi when compared to the time she plays in, but the game will have grown and changed its style.</p>\n<p>Another comparison that can’t be made in the sport of basketball is men to women. Taurasi has a more masculine style of play, which allows the comparison, but overall, the men and women’s game are too different. When the women find its best player ever, like Jordan is considered, nobody will be saying that she’s the women’s version of Jordan.</p>\n<p>While basketball is basketball, men and women play extremely different styles, the men being more athletic and the women playing a more strategic, finesse game.</p>\n<p>So, when that best player ever arises for the women, you’ll know it because there will be no comparison to the men. The game will have reached the point where women will be respected.</p>\n<p>You’ll simply hear, “That’s _________ and she’s the best player to ever play the women’s game.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of wnba.com</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52308\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52308\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/","id":3227,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3226,3225,3224],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host First Place Cal Poly in Blue-Green Rivarly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-VBall-Shaminder-Dhindsa.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-VBall-Shaminder-Dhindsa.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball preview vs. Cal Poly","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team finishes off a three-game home stand this weekend with the season’s first installment of the blue-green rivalry.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter Saturday’s game with a 6-8 overall record and at 1-1 Big West mark.

While she has consistently led the team in kills, Sully’s temporary move to libero comes at a crucial time during the season as the team continues searching for answers in their rotation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a bummer not having [Leah] hitting because she’s such a great asset to the team, but she’s doing a great job at [playing libero],” Thompson said. “She’s been one of our big hitters this entire year, so that definitely puts some pressure on the other outside hitters who are filling her shoes.”</p>\n<p>That pressure didn’t seem to faze the Gauchos’ hitters in their dominant victory over Irvine last weekend, as they finished off an astounding .394 percent of their kill attempts. Behind a strong team attack, five players end up with five or more kills, the most they’ve had in any three-set game this season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had to be more balanced,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’ve played an extremely tough schedule and [gained] a lot of experience from that. ”</p>\n<p>The players most responsible for filling in for Sully as outside hitter are freshman Ali Spindt and sophomore Ali Barbeau, who had 26 and 20 kills, respectively, in the two games last weekend.</p>\n<p>“They’re doing really well,” Thompson said of the other outside hitters. “They’re young so they don’t have as much experience as Leah does but they’re definitely stepping up.”</p>\n<p>Thompson continues to dominate the position with a team-high 3.46 kills per set, well ahead of Sully’s second-highest of 2.47.</p>\n<p>The rival Mustangs were able to do what UCSB couldn’t do and defeat the 19ers last weekend. Their duo of senior outside hitters Chelsea Hardin and Megan McConnell lead another well-balanced attack with each averaging over three kills per set.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos are not as worried about Cal Poly’s attack as they are about their defense.</p>\n<p>“We know that Cal Poly is a very strong, defensive team,” Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Mustangs face off at 7 p.m. this weekend in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of Oct. 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52315\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52315\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/","id":5262,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5261,5260,5259],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Now is When it Counts","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MSoccer-cover-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MSoccer-cover-file-photo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Begins Big West Play This Weekend at Home Versus CSF and UCR","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After finishing its nonconference portion of the schedule last Sunday with a victory, UCSB men’s soccer team will begin Big West Conference play tomorrow night when the Gauchos host Cal State Fullerton in the first of two weekend matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB entered the season with a goal of winning the Big West North Division and reaching the conference championship game, a goal that will largely be impacted this weekend when the Gauchos get the opportunity to start conference play with a statement.</p>\n<p>“As much as we’re excited, we’re also looking at making sure that we’ve got the right team on the field that’s healthy and had a good week of practice,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We have set the goal of winning our side of the Big West … and getting ourselves into a conference championship game.

For us, and for everybody, it all starts on Friday. And whether it’s Northridge or Fullerton, we have to play well to win games.”</p>\n<p>Likely to lead the Gauchos’ offensive attack this weekend will be a pair of seniors from France, in midfielder Goffin Boyoko and forward Achille Campion. Boyoko ranks first on the team and fifth in the conference with four goals scored this season, while Campion recorded three goals. Assisting the two will be freshman forward Ismaila Jome, who leads UCSB in assists with four, a mark tied for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>While goals have been hard to come by for the Gauchos in nonconference, UCSB cannot afford to play at the same level in the Big West, which features No. 6 Northridge and No. 25 Irvine.</p>\n<p>“We have some players who are going to have to step up for us on Friday if we’re going to have a successful run at the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “In general, I think we need every player to play well. I think the league is good enough, and I don’t think anyone is that talented where a team can have two or three players take a night off and still win the game.”</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos face Fullerton on Friday, they must immediately prep for UC Riverside on Sunday night, a squad that has given Santa Barbara fits in the past.</p>\n<p>“Each time we’ve played them, it seems like we have something missing. They’re a team that has been tough to play against because of the style of play,” Vom Steeg said. “They’re a team in the 4-5-1; they defend, they breakout and for some reason we just have not been able to stamp the game and put them away. Every year that we’ve kept them around, they’ve come back to hurt us.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters Big West play with a 5-2-2 record, yet has lost its last two games by a combined 5-0 margin. The Highlanders will play at Cal Poly Friday night in their Big West opener before traveling to Santa Barbara for Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited by the fact that we’re playing Riverside at our place,” Vom Steeg said. “I think Riverside is probably the toughest place to play in the conference. So the fact that we only play them once and we play that game at UCSB is very good.”</p>\n<p>In order for the Gauchos to accomplish their goal of winning the Big West North, they will undoubtedly have to open conference play with a victory, especially considering there are only 10 conference games, with each team splitting the games between home and away.</p>\n<p>“The good news is that if you do reach that goal, it means you’re going to have a real good chance to reach the postseason. It’s going to be very, very competitive,” Vom Steeg said. “Whichever team is the most consistent, whichever team is able to come away with some tough wins or at least get a tough win on the road is going to be the team that comes out on top.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday night’s game against Fullerton is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Harder Stadium, while Sunday against Riverside is set for a 5 p.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Oct. 3r’d print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/","id":1603,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1602,1601,1600],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Play UCI, LBSU for First Big West Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-Soccer-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-Soccer-file-photo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's soccer vs. UCI, LBSU preview","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over a month of preparation has led up to this moment.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, the UCSB women’s soccer team begins its long awaited conference season at home against UC Irvine.

Nevertheless, that is all a distant memory for the team now that the real season is about to start. All that matters is league.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine had success similar to the Gauchos during its nonconference schedule and comes into Harder Stadium with a 5-4 overall record.</p>\n<p>In September, UCI upset BYU, which was ranked No.6 in the country at the time, in what was the program’s biggest victory against a ranked opponent.</p>\n<p>Irvine still showed it has room for improvement though as in its most recent game they were picked apart by Washington State for a 4-0 loss.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB has the advantage of playing at home where they are 4-1, the Anteaters showcase an identical record on the road that the Gauchos have at home, including impressive victories against Oregon and Oregon State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has been led offensively by junior midfielder/forward Madison Beckley, who has had a breakout season thus far. She scored the lone goal for UCSB in the last game to give her four on the season, a team-high and third overall in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Although she has started only three games, her role coming off the bench has translated to better offensive flow for the team as a whole. The Gauchos have been a surprise offensively this year as UCSB is tied with Cal Poly for most goals scored in the Big West with 16 and third in assists with 16 as well.</p>\n<p>Despite the offense being a surprise, the defense UCSB has shown has been on point with what was expected of them in the beginning of the year even though original starting goalkeeper Makenna Henry has been sidelined with injury for the past seven games. Sophomore Beth Ritter has filled in between the post and is leading the league in goals-against average (0.61), goals against (5) and is second in save percentage (.821).</p>\n<p>Irvine has a balanced attack offensively with seven different players on the team scoring and junior forward Laura McGrail leading the team in goals with four on the season. The Irvine defense will give UCSB trouble as they have carried the team as evident by its four shutouts.</p>\n<p>Long Beach will pose just as much of a threat, if not more. for Santa Barbara. The 49ers have the best winning percentage in the Big West with a 6-4 overall record with their best win coming by a 1-0 score line against ranked BYU after its defeat by Irvine; it was only BYU’s fourth lost in its last 32 games.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Kaci McCain has been stellar guarding the net for Long Beach. McCain has only been scored on six times this season and her goal-against average ranks third with 0.75. Long Beach’s stingy defense, evident by its 1.10 goal against average, will give UCSB problems on offense.</p>\n<p>Friday’s game against UC Irvine is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. and kick-off for Sunday’s match versus Long Beach State is for 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article article appeared on page 7 of October 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/ucsb-play-uci-lbsu-for-first-big-west-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/ucsb-play-uci-lbsu-for-first-big-west-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/ucsb-play-uci-lbsu-for-first-big-west-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/ucsb-play-uci-lbsu-for-first-big-west-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/ucsb-play-uci-lbsu-for-first-big-west-matches/","id":1597,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1596,1595,1594],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sacramento Kings Finally See Positive Changes in the Front Office","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After avoiding a move to Seattle, the Kings are trying to regain their stability from the top down.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With plenty of change for the Sacramento Kings in the past year comes a lot of new pieces to the puzzle — a new beginning, a new owner, a new general manager, a new coach and a new style.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is this is the new era for the Kings.</p>\n<p>New can be good, but it can also be bad.

While it is extremely easy for Ranadive to look like a fantastic owner after the Capital City watched the Maloof brothers’ deceit and lies for far too long, Ranadive has made a great effort to give Sacramento hope again.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, Ranadive appears to have the opposite persona of the Maloofs. He seems to genuinely care about Sacramento and wants to revive the city. What’s key though, is that Ranadive isn’t just talking; he’s actually putting together a great management team.</p>\n<p>The foundation of any sports franchise is the general manager (GM). Thank goodness for Sac Town that’s a new face. Replacing the outdated Geoff Petrie is Pete D’Alessandro. A former executive for the Denver Nuggets and the Golden State Warriors, D’Alessandro is known for his basketball smarts and communication with other members within the franchise. He realizes that rebuilding the Kings is a process and unlike Petrie, knows that you actually need to have talented players to be a playoff contender.</p>\n<p>For example, D’Alessandro inked DeMarcus Cousins, the face of the Kings, to a four-year extension. He traded Tyreke Evans for Greivis Vasquez to aid Head Coach Michael Malone’s effort in creating an unselfish offense and at this year’s draft, brought in a rookie class that with some work could be important pieces in years to come. D’Alessandro also signed a player he is familiar with in power forward Carl Landry, who helped guide the Warriors to the postseason last year. Also fitting in with Malone’s unselfish style of play is new signing Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, who is a defensive specialist on the wing, an important position in this fast-paced day and age of the NBA.</p>\n<p>Ranadive also hired an advisor to help both himself and D’Alessandro. This advisor just happens to be a big name in the basketball world: Chris Mullin. This Hall of Famer, five-time NBA All-Star and member of the 1992 Dream Team not only knows the game of basketball, but has GM experience with the Warriors.</p>\n<p>Bringing in Mullin shows Ranadive is serious about rebuilding. He’s bringing attention to Sacramento while assuring he has great leaders below him. In other words, he’s not taking the easy way out.</p>\n<p>The last piece to the management puzzle, of course, is the coach. Ranadive chose Warriors assistant Malone, who has made clear that the identity of the Sacramento squad needs a revision. Malone also added former player Dee Brown and fan favorite and former King and fan favorite Corliss Williamson to his coaching staff. Williamson has a chance to be an impactful coach immediately, working with Cousins and the fellow big men down low.</p>\n<p>One thing that has been guaranteed to change under Malone is Sacramento’s defense. Last season, the Kings gave up a dismal 105.1 points per game, the worst in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Despite preaching defense, Malone does want to play fast and use the fast break, which suits the personnel of this young, athletic squad with numerous quick guards. The biggest change on the offensive end, though, should be the mentality. Malone is not going to tolerate selfish play, which is one reason the Kings shipped off Evans in turn for a past first point guard in Vasquez.</p>\n<p>When noticing the background of this staff, Golden State comes up a lot. All have backgrounds with the Warriors; they all know each other, know the game, and as a result, are making the transition much more fluid while committing themselves to Sacramento.</p>\n<p>Then, one extra piece was added to the front office. To die-hard Kings fans it was a shock: Shaquille O’Neal became a new minority owner. There is no introduction needed for the retired Lakers big man in the city of Sacramento, but despite the long-standing hatred toward him, which I don’t see changing no matter what he does, he might be the answer to Sacramento’s prayers.</p>\n<p>For several years now, Cousins has not been reaching his potential. He’s had an attitude. He’s been suspended by the organization. He’s downright underperformed, but with O’Neal as his mentor, Cousins could become the franchise player the Kings need him to be. Plus, O’Neal is a huge name in the basketball world and it doesn’t hurt to bring that kind of attention to Sacramento.</p>\n<p>The Kings rewarded Cousins with a big contract and are heavily relying on him to get his personal orders in check and improve his consistency as a dominating basketball player on a nightly basis. It will be up to Cousins to prove he deserved the extension.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, whether the Kings can snap their seven-year streak without making the postseason is in the hands of the players. They determine the wins and losses. But the look of the Kings in the future and putting the pieces together to return to a playoff contender resides in the hands of the management.</p>\n<p>So far, Sacramento is on the right track.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 2, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52277\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52277\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/","id":634,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[633,632,631],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sacramento Kings Build Momentum at UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Sacramento Kings opened training camp at UCSB Tuesday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_52281\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52281\" data-attachment-id=\"52281\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/attachment/127/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=3888%2C2592&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3888,2592\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1380630707\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"127\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-52281\" alt=\"127\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127-1024x682.jpg?resize=610%2C406\" width=\"610\" height=\"406\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-52281\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Sacramento Kings started their 2013-2014 season at UCSB yesterday.

Hopefully this is an opportunity for us to bond, unite and build the chemistry and trust you need. This is a great facility at UCSB, a great city and I think all of our guys are pretty happy to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Public Relations Chris Clark , the location for the Kings training camp was between Santa Barbara and one other location. However, when Kings Staff checked the site in August, they decided UCSB was the perfect place.</p>\n<p>“You’re always looking for somewhere that can relax your guys,” Clark said. “It’s a long season, 82 games. Santa Barbara gives us the chance to come to a beautiful locale, good weather and good facilities. When you combine all those things, it was an easy decision.”</p>\n<p>Sacramento will be conducting training camp at UCSB until Sunday, Oct. 6 at which point they will travel to face Golden State in their first preseason game of the season Oct. 7.</p>\n<p>Golden State may be a familiar opponent to many members of the Kings, as Malone was an assistant with the Warriors during last season’s impressive campaign.</p>\n<p>Other members of the Kings’ front office that hold ties to the Warriors community include advisor Chris Mullin (Warriors’ Hall of Famer and former GM), owner Vivek Ranadive (former part-owner of Warriors) and General Manager Pete D’Alessandro (former Warriors’ assistant GM).</p>\n<p>“Obviously I was a part of [the Warriors] the last two years,” Malone said. “We wish them well, but we’re doing our own thing. This is about the Sacramento Kings. It’s just a new day for Sacramento and the fact that a lot of people came up from the bay is just a coincidence.”</p>\n<p>After undergoing much turmoil in the form of ownership issues and a possible relocation to Seattle in previous seasons, the Kings can finally get away from all the off-court drama associated with the franchise and focus back on the court.</p>\n<p>“Not having you guys have to ask me if we’re going to be staying this year is definitely good and it’s great for the fans too,” forward Jason Thompson said. “On the court, the mindset has changed too. We’re going to be a defensive team that can get out and score. We’ll be a fun team to watch.”</p>\n<p>With a new era under Malone comes a new style of play, which looks to dramatically improve on the defensive end for a team that ranked last in points allowed per game last season by a large margin.</p>\n<p>“I want to defend and from the defense, everything else will come,” Malone said. “We still want to run, but we want to run with discipline. None of that will happen if we don’t commit to defending and rebounding at a high level.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, the new regime wants a more unselfish style of play, as evidenced by the team’s move to send Tyreke Evans to New Orleans in exchange for point guard Greivis Vasquez, who ranked third in the NBA last season with 9.0 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Combined with fellow point guard Isaiah Thomas, the Kings look set at a position that was so often reliant on the shoot-first Evans.</p>\n<p>“What I loved today was that [we had] two highly competitive players fighting for a starting job pushing each other,” Malone said. “We have two very talented point guards that will hopefully lead us to a lot of wins this year.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Kings is center DeMarcus Cousins, who was recently signed to a four-year $62 million deal that clearly shows the team’s trust in Cousins to become the franchise player that will once again lead them to the postseason.</p>\n<p>Other notable players in attendance include John Salmons, Thomas, Marcus Thornton, Ben McLemore and Jason Thompson.</p>\n<p>Now that a new season has arrived for a franchise with a much changed makeup, the Kings will try and improve upon last season’s 28-54 record and possibly contend for a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive Western Conference.</p>\n<p>“Obviously the goal is to make the playoffs,” Guard Jimmer Fredette said. “We want to move forward as an organization and as a team and get better each and every day.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly seems like the perfect place for a franchise searching for a fresh start and if the vibe from the Kings training camp is any indication, a little bit of Santa Barbara may be just what the Kings needed to start off the season on a high note.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 3 of October 2, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kristen Henneman of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Usual playoff contenders such as the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers are winless, while some usual cellar dwellers such as the Miami Dolphins are finding ways to win. Perhaps the most surprising start this season has been the resurgence of the Kansas City Chiefs under new Head Coach Andy Reid. Sparked by a stellar defense, the Chiefs look like they may be in contention for a playoff spot in the AFC.</p>\n<p>While it would take a miracle for the Chiefs to surpass the high-powered Denver Broncos, Kansas City certainly looks capable of securing a wild card spot, especially with a 4-0 record already on the season. When examining the schedule, naysayers may note that the Chiefs have yet to beat any team of merit this season, but at times, the Chiefs look straight up dominant.</p>\n<p>For Kansas City, it all starts on the defensive end. The Chiefs lead the NFL in points allowed, surrendering just over 10 points per game. To put that in perspective, if the Chiefs were to maintain that average the entire season, they would narrowly edge out the 2000 Ravens for fewest points allowed in a 16-game season. While that mark is almost undoubtedly sure to rise for KC, there is still no denying the fact that its defense has been a revelation this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Third-year outside linebacker Justin Houston started the year on fire, registering an NFL high 7.5 sacks this season and almost equaling his career-high 10-sack mark he set during last season’s Pro Bowl campaign. Houston may not be able to keep up the same sack pace this season, but he certainly looks like he is capable of registering 15-plus sacks on the season for the Chiefs’ solid front seven, which leads the NFL with 18 sacks this season.</p>\n<p>The strength of the Chiefs’ defense certainly seems to be its linebacking corps. Houston and veterans Tamba Hali and Derrick Johnson form an intimidating trio to go along with a solid fourth linebacker in Akeem Jordan, who is usually pulled when the team switches from its base 3-4 defense to a nickel to defend the pass.</p>\n<p>Hali and Houston provide tremendous quarterback pressure from the edges while Johnson is a more do-it-all type of linebacker, as evidenced by his three-straight 100-plus tackle seasons. The defensive line may not add a whole lot, aside from nose tackle Dontari Poe, who has 3.5 sacks this season, but the Chiefs’ front seven has the looks of a young but promising defense.</p>\n<p>Kansas City’s secondary, meanwhile, has put up extremely strong numbers to start the season, allowing fewer than 190 passing yards per game this season. Much of that success can be attributed to the pressure the front seven has managed to place on opposing quarterbacks, but the secondary deserves similar credit as well. Headlined by safety Eric Berry, this young and aggressive secondary has proven capable of shutting down high-powered passing attacks such as the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles.</p>\n<p>With the eldest starting defensive back (Brandon Flowers) at 27 years old, this Chiefs’ secondary certainly has shown it is willing to grow together and become one of the more consistent and dangerous units in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Andy Reid has revitalized this Chiefs franchise into a legitimate playoff contender in just one year and deserves much of the credit due to his leadership style. Sure, the Chiefs could flame out similar to last season’s Arizona Cardinals, but this Kansas City team has the looks of a playoff team with a strong defense to go along with a veteran quarterback who has many dangerous offensive weapons at his disposal.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing the Chiefs have on the offensive side of the ball, it is speed. Running back Jamaal Charles is arguably the fastest back in the NFL, and he has proven dangerous in both the running and passing game throughout his career. Wide receivers Donnie Avery and Dexter McCluster also possess that breakaway speed that allows the Chiefs to stretch the field, while Dwayne Bowe is the big target over the middle for Alex Smith.</p>\n<p>Smith may not have felt the love in San Francisco, but he is doing a fine job finding his weapons in the open field and staying efficient in the process. His 7:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio is amongst the best in the league, and Smith has continually proven dangerous with his arm and legs, tools that constantly allow him to avoid pressure from opposing defenses. Smith may not be a quarterback that can lead the Chiefs to the Super Bowl, but he is a veteran and is off to a great start this season.</p>\n<p>Look for the Chiefs to continue winning games this season and to at least challenge Denver’s clinching of the AFC West by Week 12 of the season. I’m predicting an 11-win season for a Chiefs team that finished last season with the worst record in the NFL.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fantasy Football</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest, it has been a tough start in fantasy football for me this season. Some of the guys I thought were going to have really big years (C.J. Spiller in particular) have gotten off to slow starts. Nonetheless, my team is surviving through injuries to Danny Amendola, Rob Gronkowski and Roddy White, so I’m still holding out hope.</p>\n<p>However, along with the struggling veterans come exciting breakout players that have been fantasy all-starts throughout the first four weeks. Here are my fantasy breakout stars of the first quarter of the NFL season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Quarterback: Philip Rivers, San Diego Chargers</p>\n<p>As weird as it is to say, Rivers has been one of the better quarterbacks to start this 2013 season. Only Peyton Manning tops his 11:2 touchdown to interception ratio, and Rivers ranks second in the league behind only Manning in quarterback rating as well. Rivers is finding ways to put the ball in the end zone and avoid the costly turnovers fans have come to expect from him. He is a solid starting quarterback option any time he takes the field, and with matchups against Oakland and Jacksonville looming in weeks five and seven, there is no better time to ride the hot hand with Rivers than now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Running Back: Reggie Bush, Detroit Lions</p>\n<p>Bush is finally showing why he was so highly prized coming out of USC eight years ago. While he was reliable the last two seasons while in Miami, Bush has proven deadly thus far in Detroit. Matthew Stafford gets him the ball regularly out of the backfield, and Bush is perhaps the biggest dual-threat back this season in terms of both rushing and receiving. If he can stay healthy, Bush will continue to be a focal point of the Lions’ offensive attack and rack up a monster fantasy season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wide Receiver: Pierre Garçon, Washington Redskins</p>\n<p>There may have been better breakout options than Garçon at the wideout position, but you can’t argue the type of year he is having. Garçon has recorded at least six receptions in all four games this season and looks like the most dangerous weapon that Robert Griffin III has at his disposal. If the Redskins can get back to any of the same offensive production they had last season, Garçon will continue to build upon his already promising year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tight End: Jordan Cameron, Cleveland Browns</p>\n<p>Anyone who drafted and started Cameron this season knows they potentially picked up the biggest steal of the season. While he has cracked 100 receiving yards only once this season, Cameron already has five touchdown receptions and has scored 15 or more points in three of four weeks. Despite the Browns’ quarterback deficiencies, Cameron will remain a threat in the red zone, thus racking up touchdowns for the rest of the year. He has been a stud at the tight end position this season, rivaled only by Jimmy Graham in terms of consistency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Defense: Kansas City Chiefs</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have posted 20-point fantasy performances three times this season and look like a top-tier option and must-add for any owner. Add their league-leading 18 sacks to five interceptions and seven fumble recoveries and it is no wonder the Chiefs’ defense is lighting it up on a weekly basis. Keep in mind they also get to play the Raiders twice this season, so expect them to continue to put up great numbers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52248\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52248\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/","id":3226,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3225,3224,3223],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes 1-1 at Home To Open Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W_Vball_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W_Vball_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team went 1-1 this past weekend in what was both their first home and Big West games of the season.

However, after a timeout, UCSB scored three straight points and ended up dominating the majority of the game.</p>\n<p>After breezing through the first set 25-19 and winning the second set 25-21, the Gauchos met their biggest test of the night in the third set. The Gauchos were able to prevail off a kill by senior outside hitter Katey Thompson, ending the set with a score of 26-24 and the game 3-0.</p>\n<p>“It was really important for us to get this win,” sophomore opposite Jaylen Villanueva said. “We just came out today with so much fire and so much intensity and we’re really excited for this win.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for UCSB were Thompson and freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt with 10 kills each, while freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg added five kills and the team’s only block. Spindt also led the way with 14 digs as she continues to excel in just her first year with the team.</p>\n<p>“We kept our energy high on the court and we were able to shake off the balls that we missed,” Villanueva said.</p>\n<p>The first conference win of the season came on the heels of a tough loss to Long Beach on Friday night. In the fifth and final set, UCSB found itself tied 12-12 with the 49ers before conceding three of the final four points and losing the match 3-2.</p>\n<p>Thompson and Spindt led the way for the offense in this one as well, with 23 and 16 kills, respectively, and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau added 13 kills of her own. Senior Leah Sully made her first start of the season at libero, and she led the team with 20 digs.</p>\n<p>“Leah’s a great ball hander and unfortunately it’s putting her in a position where she has to pass the ball a lot for us,” Lantagne Welch said. “Tonight we just had incredible offensive production, hitting close to .400 as a team with so many players contributing, so that was definitely a credit to our passers, our setting and our hitters to be smart when attacking.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ends its home stand on Saturday when it hosts rival Cal Poly. The game will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52225\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52225\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/","id":5308,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5307,5306,5305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Decision to No. 19 Denver","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"All of the grit the UCSB women’s soccer team displayed during its first 10 games of the season was on display in its final non-conference game of the season versus the University of Denver.

Up against the 19th ranked team in the country at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost 2-1 on a late second-half goal, despite the tenacity they showcased.</p>\n<p>The loss drops UCSB to 6-4-1 overall and marks the second time this season the Gauchos have dropped consecutive games. With the victory, the Pioneers move to 8-1-1 on the year as they remain consistent on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB made it a priority to control Denver’s main offensive weapon in senior forward Kristen Hamilton and kept her in check throughout much of the match. Hamilton entered the game with seven goals in only nine games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, the Pioneers still managed to find a hole in the defense early in the first half. The defense, which has been a strong point of the team for the season, gave up a goal via a corner kick in the 18th minute to make the match 1-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Brooke Boothe settled the ball on the pass from senior midfielder Nicholette DiGiacomo and lifted it over the goalkeeper to give the Pioneers the lead going into halftime. Santa Barbara responded with a goal coming out of the half.</p>\n<p>In the 52nd minute, junior midfielder Madison Beckley received the ball from sophomore defender Savannah Francis at the top of the box and shot it past the Pioneer defense and into the left corner of the net to draw the game even at one goal apiece. The goal was Beckley’s fourth goal of the season, giving her the most of the team.</p>\n<p>From there on, the game was an even stalemate with each team struggling to maintain ball possession. However, much as it has done for most of the season, Denver began to wear down its opponent as the game got deeper into the second half. The Pioneers began to increase the pressure and had a series of shots on target against the goalkeeper, getting as close as hitting the crossbar.</p>\n<p>The pressure from Denver proved to be overwhelming for the Gauchos who were called for a foul inside the box in the 76th minute of the game. Junior defender Sam Harder stepped up to the spot and kicked it past sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter to give the Pioneers the 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>Denver held the Gauchos in check for the remaining time left on the clock and controlled the pace of the game after scoring the go-ahead goal, ultimately defeating the Gauchos 2-1.</p>\n<p>Denver benefitted from being the aggressors on the pitch as they outshot the Gauchos 15-8. However, most of the damage done by the Pioneers came in the second half, as they had an impressive 12 shots and limited Santa Barbara to only one shot in the period. The sluggish second-half play of the Gauchos was in direct contrast to its play in the first half, where they had seven shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The next game of the season will begin the start of conference play for the Gauchos as they host UC Irvine at Harder Stadium. The Anteaters enter the game with a record of 5-4 overall. Kick-off for Friday’s game against the Anteaters is scheduled to start at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/","id":1598,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1597,1596,1595],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Playing its first two games at home since the beginning of classes, the UCSB men’s soccer team split a pair of matches over the weekend.

The Gauchos dropped a 2-1 heartbreaker to Stanford in overtime on Friday before rebounding with a 1-0 victory over Loyola Marymount on Sunday night to improve to 5-4 this year.</p>\n<p>“[The victory] was much needed, especially the way we got it, because there were some heartbreaks the last two games,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think it was important for us morale wise and psyche wise. Obviously we’re very encouraged by today’s result.”</p>\n<p>Sunday night’s victory over LMU (4-2-1) featured an aggressive Gauchos’ offensive attack that outshot the Lions 17-11 with a 9-4 advantage in shots on goal.

Sophomore defender Marshall Cazares and freshman forward Ismaila Jome each received assists on the play, Jome’s team leading fourth this season.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Achille Campion led UCSB with three shots on goal while Jome contributed two. Jome is quickly becoming a dangerous weapon for the Gauchos and is one of five freshmen starting for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“[Jome] just gets on everything. The thing about him is he competes, he’s fearless,” Vom Steeg said. “You look at a player like that and there’s no reason he shouldn’t potentially be the freshman of the year in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Paul Ehmann received a red card in the 89th minute, forcing the Gauchos to play a man down for the remaining minute plus. Luckily, a Lions’ comeback never materialized. Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely posted his second career shutout Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We had 17 shots and we were dangerous. It was the first time we scored where we actually passed four times next to each other,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought all that was promising. At the end of the day we got the result we needed tonight. It was an important win going into league.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s highly anticipated match against Stanford (5-1-1) proved to be entertaining for the 7,750 fans in attendance. Tied at one apiece and in overtime, Stanford used the second goal of the day from freshman forward Jordan Morris in the 95th minute to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>Morris scored in the 31st minute to give Stanford a 1-0 lead before senior defender Peter Schmetz scored his first goal of the season in the 53rd minute to tie the game and ultimately send it to overtime. Ehmann and sophomore forward Charlie Miller were credited with assists on the goal by Schmetz.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s offense struggled to convert opportunities into goals, a clear theme thus far in the season. The Gauchos outshot Stanford 12-8 with a 6-4 advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I was a little bit frustrated after the Stanford game because I had a chance after four minutes and I missed it,” Boyoko said. “We have the chances, we just need to shoot on target and make the keeper make the save.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos open conference play on Friday when they host Cal State Fullerton.

Whitelegge again stepped up on the defensive end, leading UCSB with 10 saves and willing the Gauchos to an 11-7 victory.</p>\n<p>The victory over UCSD was the second of the season for the Gauchos, previously defeating the Tritons 16-7 back on Sept. 21 in the first game of the Nor Cal Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We traveled to San Diego and played UCSD in their home pool and put together another solid game,” Shoemaker said. “Chris played a very good game in the cage and we had many guys step up on offense.”</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, UCSB stayed in San Diego to play Navy. The match was close early, with the two teams battling to a 3-3 tie at the end of the first quarter. The Gauchos created some separation in the second quarter thanks to their keeper, who shut down the Tritons to give UCSB a 6-3 advantage.</p>\n<p>The offense took off in the second half, putting up seven goals in the third quarter. UCSB maintained control for the rest of the game, finishing with a 16-7 win. Senior Matt Gronow led the way with four goals for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Navy was the first team Santa Barbara has faced this season that hails from outside California.</p>\n<p>After finishing the week 4-0, the season continues for UCSB on Oct. 12 with the SoCal Tournament in Irvine, California.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next host an Alumni Game on Saturday, Oct. 5 at 1 p.m. in Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52229\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52229\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/","id":5105,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[5104,5103,5102],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Readies for SoCal Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M-WPolo-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M-WPolo-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Men's water polo preview at Socal Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After participating in a four-game tournament last weekend in northern California, UCSB will head down south for another four game set of matches that begin Friday.</p>\n<p>UCSB will start competition Friday against Cal Lutheran University.

He is looking for an offensive success this weekend.</p>\n<p>“[Against UCLA] we went off for 10 goals in the first half, giving ourselves some good cushion and the opportunity to play some of our younger guys,” Shoemaker said. “We want to continue that trend this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return to Santa Barbara after Saturday night’s final game against the Navy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/ucsb-readies-for-socal-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/ucsb-readies-for-socal-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/ucsb-readies-for-socal-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/ucsb-readies-for-socal-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/ucsb-readies-for-socal-tournament/","id":5108,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[5107,5106,5105],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Finish Non-Conference Play Strong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Soccer-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Soccer-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As the first Big West game of the season approaches next week, the UCSB women’s soccer team prepares for its final preseason match against the University of Denver on Sunday.

Having allowed a total of only eight goals in 10 matches, the Gauchos will continue to rely on their defense against the Pioneers on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters Sunday’s contest winners of six games this season, having lost three with one draw, and have the highest winning percentage of any team in the Big West thus far. Prior to last Sunday versus then-ranked No. 17 Texas Tech, the Gauchos were on a five-game winning streak and shut out all of it opponents during the stretch. However, Santa Barbara was victim to a defensive miscue and a free kick to fall 2-0 against the Red Raiders.</p>\n<p>Unlike last season where the strength of the team lacked a definitive answer, this year the clear source of effectiveness for the Gauchos has been defense. What is more impressive has been the play of sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter, who has filled in perfectly for injured senior goalkeeper Makenna Henry. Listed at only 5’4”, Ritter currently leads the league in goals-against average with 0.41 in seven games played.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Notable results on the offensive end of the pitch can also be credited to UCSB’s good play entering its game against Denver. Contrast to the prior season where the Gauchos failed to convert on their scoring opportunities, UCSB has scored 15 goals in its games played which is tied for first in the Big West along with Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Although distribution of the ball has been key with eight different players scoring goals, the trio of junior midfielder Madison Beckley, senior forward Allie Ariniello and junior midfielder Indiana Mead have excelled in their roles as playmakers for the team.</p>\n<p>Beckley and Ariniello lead the squad with three goals scored and have two assists each. Mead has scored two goals, notched two assists and done an excellent job of creating her own shots, as evident by her team-high 19 shots.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos’ previous opponent, Denver comes in ranked at No. 21 in the country. The Pioneers are 7-1-1 overall on the season and will present a challenge on offense for UCSB. Senior forward Kristen Hamilton has scored seven goals in only nine games played this season and has distributed the ball as well with five assists, each statistic being a team-high.</p>\n<p>The Pioneers have been a second-half team so far, wearing down its opponents and scoring almost twice as much after halftime than the first half. The Gauchos will also have the tough task of having to defeat Denver at home where they are unbeaten in five games this year.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for the final non-conference match of the season on Sunday at the University of Denver is scheduled for 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cedar Lay of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52046\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/52046/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52046\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/52046/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/52046/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/52046/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-27/52046/","id":1595,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1594,1593,1592],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sports Editors’ Welcome: Kristen Henneman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Editors-Welcome-Art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Editors-Welcome-Art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sports Editor Kristen Henneman's contagious enthusiasm and love for UCSB sports just might make you forget she's not a Laker fan.

I may be slightly biased, but UCSB really is the best. My three years here thus far have been memorable in so many ways.</p>\n<p>One reason for this, of course, is because of its sports. I’m now entering my fourth year with the <em>Nexus</em> as a writer and my second as an editor, so I’ve covered most of the sports here. We may not be a sports powerhouse, but we’re still DI and have some spectacular teams.</p>\n<p>Our men’s water polo team is currently ranked No. 6. The men’s basketball team features the Preseason Big West Player of the Year Alan Williams and the women’s basketball team has reached the postseason for the past two seasons. Our baseball team made the NCAA Tournament last year too.

We have real fútbol (a.k.a. soccer), and it’s absolutely fantastic. UCSB isn’t known as soccer heaven for nothing. Last year, the team was ranked as highly as No. 3 in the nation.</p>\n<p>So go to the first game of the year tomorrow against Stanford and give it a try. My first ever soccer game as a freshman was against UCLA. UCSB won 2-0 in a tremendous upset in front of what was basically a sold-out crowd. We set the NCAA record for attendance at a soccer game with 15,896 people, the majority throwing tortillas in celebration. It is one of my favorite memories at UCSB, so I’d love to see all incoming students have a similar experience.</p>\n<p>As for a bit about me, I am a communication major, Spanish minor who would love to turn sports journalism into a career. All my life, sports have been my thing. Most girls have celebrities or pictures of friends on their bedroom walls; I have pictures of basketball players.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think basketball is the best sport on the planet. Whether it’s playing, watching or writing it, men or women, pro, college or any other level, I love this game.</p>\n<p>Coming from the Sac Town area, my favorite team is the Sacramento Kings. I’m extremely excited to see what they do in what’s been deemed a new era. Also, all of you should know that while I currently reside in Laker territory, there’s no saying I love more than ‘beat LA.’</p>\n<p>What makes me different than most basketball fans, and sports fans in general though, is that I prefer the women’s game. I’m currently glued to the television right now with the WNBA playoffs in full swing.</p>\n<p>I grew up playing a bunch of sports year-round, but my dream was always to play in the WNBA. When I realized that wasn’t going to happen, I figured if I couldn’t play for them, I’d write for them.</p>\n<p>And with my love for sports, it didn’t take long for me to fall in love with sports writing. I wrote my first sports piece at 14, and with every article, I fall more and more deeply in love. As tough as it can be putting the sports section together at 1 a.m. sometimes, I do truly adore my job.

Long Beach State has started 7-6, while the Anteaters are sitting comfortably above .500 at 9-5.</p>\n<p>While a 5-7 start is not necessarily a dream for the Gauchos, they are hoping their preseason tune-up games and weekly practices will help them get off to a strong start in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“This entire week has just been focused on game time situations and how to finish big points,” Sherrard said. “That’s something that we were trying to focus on in the preseason tournaments. We know Long Beach pretty well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have had a lot of changes since the end of last season, first with the departure of long-time head coach Kathy Gregory and next with the introduction of six new freshmen to the team.</p>\n<p>Replacing Gregory is new head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, who is coming off a very successful stint at the University of Miami.</p>\n<p>Besides the drastic change at head coach, there have been big changes all over the roster. Most notable of these changes is the departure of last year’s standout freshman libero Taylor Formico, who broke the school and Big West record for digs.</p>\n<p>“[Formico] did leave a pretty big hole,” Sherrard said. “We realized it was a big change, but we all just came together and figured out a way to get past [losing her].”</p>\n<p>The team also brought in six new freshmen, a couple of which have already made a positive impact on the court. Freshmen middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg lead the team in blocks with 37 and 32, respectively.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt has really hit stride early in the season, and is tied for the second most kills on the team with 102.</p>\n<p>“[Spindt] has already made a really big impact,” Sherrard said. “She’s one of our go-to [players] when it comes to kills.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Hanna Nielson, who was the Gauchos’ starting setter last season, has gotten off to a good start with 316 assists after just 12 games.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays Long Beach State in the Thunderdome at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, and UC Irvine at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/","id":5306,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5305,5304,5303],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":146,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
