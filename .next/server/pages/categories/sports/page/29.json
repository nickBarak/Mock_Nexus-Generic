This will be the seventh season for Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch as she hopes to guide this very promising squad to success in the upcoming 2018 season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There are many reasons to be excited about this year’s team, such as the many returning contributors from 2017 as well as the youth and potential of a very talented recruiting class.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Gauchos will only be losing two seniors from last year, which allows the returners to grow and improve themselves as well as their chemistry as a team. UCSB’s five leaders in kills from last season were all underclassmen, and thus they are all returning as veterans in 2018.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of these five is star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, who led the NCAA with 5.84 kills per set in 2017 and plans on returning to form again this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Also returning are the Gauchos’ leaders in assists from last year, senior setters Annie Hasselmann and Lexi Rottman, who will benefit from another year of growth with a similar team. For a team that struggled at times last season to put everything together and compete, the return of most of the main contributors is important to having a comeback season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While many key players will be returning to the floor again in 2018, Head Coach Lantagne Welch has also added more depth to the Gaucho roster by way of six freshman recruits and one transfer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">These Gaucho newcomers will certainly benefit from playing alongside the experience of the eight upperclassmen on the team, but they will also be asked to contribute a significant amount in their first year due to the upside and talent of these accomplished freshmen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the Gauchos’ weaknesses in years past has been their overall depth, and opposing teams were able to exploit that over the course of a match. However, with so many experienced veterans and new pieces, the previous lack of depth should no longer be a weakness, but rather a strength that will benefit Lantagne Welch’s squad this season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Last season was difficult for the Gauchos, as they got off to a rough start and were only able to win one non-conference game in the early stages of the season. They managed to pick things up during conference play and put together a solid 7-9 record against Big West opponents.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The team will certainly expect more consistent play throughout the season with a more experienced and talented team this time around.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There is a lot of optimism going into this season with many interesting new pieces and returning stars; however, this does mean that expectations will be higher for the Gauchos and Coach Lantagne Welch.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB women’s volleyball has not had a winning record in the Big West since the 2013 season, during which they went 13-3, won a share of the conference title and secured an NCAA tournament berth.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While the expectations might not be that high for this year, improvement is expected, and the team knows this, so they will definitely come out of the gate motivated to show that this year is different.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Gauchos begin their season on Friday, Aug. 24, with a match against the Cincinnati Bearcats, during which they hope to get their season started off on the right note.</p>\n<div

At the back, Junior transfer Faouzi Taieb–who earlier in the year became only the eighth Gaucho to be on the prestigious MAC Hermann trophy watch list–demonstrated his poise and leadership at center back, making several key tackles and holding the Warriors to only two shots on goal in the entire game.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the absence of Sophomore transfer Carson Vom Steeg, who picked up a knock in training, the rest of the backline easily nullified the Westmont attack and helped the Gauchos maintain a clean sheet. Sophomore transfer Hunter Ashworth smoothy moved into his role alongside Senior Jan Ilskens and Sophomore Adrian Adames, and the four at the back displayed a remarkable amount of chemistry considering their lack of playing time together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps most important for the Gauchos was the spark they showed on the attacking end of the pitch– a spark that was too often missing last season, when UCSB only scored 18 goals in 19 matches. Sophomore Rodney Michael once again proved why he was named the Big West Freshman of the year last season, creating havoc on the right side with his pace from the get-go. After leading the Gauchos with four assists last year, Michael picked up right where he left off, assisting on both of the first two goals for Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positive sign for Santa Barbara going forward was the obvious connection between Michael, Junior Ignacio Tellechea, and Junior transfer Thibault Candia. Tellechea and Candia both led the Gauchos with four shots, as well as two goals a piece. Despite most of their goals occuring in the six yard box, the positioning of the forwards and their composure in the box suggest that UCSB will pose much more of a threat to opposing defenses this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even off of the bench, Freshman Carter Clemmensen– a highly touted recruit from Arizona– showed why he was named the Arizona Gatorade player of the year, rounding a defender and the ‘keeper in the 30th minute before dishing off to a wide open Candia. Less than two minutes later, Candia returned the favor, taking advantage of a giveaway from Westmont before finding Clemmensen for his first ever goal in blue and gold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another great sign for Vom Steeg going forward was the performance from Senior Axel Mendez, an attacking midfielder who won Big West Freshman of the Year in 2014 before leaving the team for the past couple of seasons. In his triumphant return on Saturday, Mendez did not disappoint, consistently beating defenders off of the dribble and tallying a goal for his troubles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the only disappointment on the night for the Gauchos was that very strength on defense. Neither Freshman Goalie Ben Roach or returning Sophomore Alan Carrillo were forced to make any difficult saves on the night, leaving the depth chart murky heading into the first regular season match later this week. The two have been in a heated battle all summer for the starting position, and despite Roach drawing the nominal start, it seems the starter will be decided based on practice this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Gauchos have many positives to take away–including the Bryant and Sons trophy– Santa Barbara will face much stiffer competition when the Gauchos open up regular season play against St. John’s on Friday. The Red Storm have already picked up two results against teams in the top 25 this preseason, and will prove a formidable challenge to a Gaucho team that has legitimate Big West title aspirations this season. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Berthoud took all three shots Westmont registered in the match which comes as a surprise to no one as she was led the team in assists and was tied in goals with 11.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for UCSB to get the lead back up to two, however, as Sheehy knocked in her first goal as a Gaucho with a header that knocked off the left post.</p>\n<p>It was certainly a great night for the forward transfer in her first night representing the blue and yellow as she had a game-high two assists to go along with her lone goal. Head Coach Paul Stumpf praised Sheehy and her quality play throughout summer practice and it certainly showed why in this exhibition.</p>\n<p>Following Sheehy’s goal, the person who began the scoring, Murison, would help give the team an even bigger advantage at the conclusion of the first half knocking in another goal in the 44th minute.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would score one more in the contest in the as midfielder Sydney Magnin knocked in a free kick from 25 yards out.</p>\n<p>Overall, Saturday went about as perfectly as it could for the Gauchos as not only did they put on a show on offense, something the team had their struggles with last season, but they also were able to get everyone playing time as every single active person on the roster logged some action.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a lot of questions to answer this season. With the loss of Amanda Ball who scored 20 of the teams 53 goals over the past two seasons, it would be interesting to see who would step up and lead the team this year.</p>\n<p>While Saturday night might not have shown one standout player it did show a collective group of women working well together and that could be just the thing to revitalize a program that has missed the conference tournament the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>UCSB will kick off its season against Sac State at 4 p.m. Friday, August 17th at Peter Johann Field in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

come to an end! I must admit, this world cup felt somewhat short. I made a post about why we feel certain events happen faster than others, check it out here: <a href=\"https://omsol.weebly.com/blog/special-edition-time-perception-and-why-time-flies\">https://omsol.weebly.com/blog/special-edition-time-perception-and-why-time-flies</a>.</p>\n<p>This world cup was marked by high expectations for teams that were predicted to do well but ended up falling short. Take Germany for example; just because they won the previous world cup, everyone thought they would take it again. The high expectations people had led to disappointment. That is why I always say, “Never have high expectations”, it usually leads to disappointment. This world cup saw a lot of underdogs, or seemingly “weaker” teams go far.</p>\n<p>Russia for example, made it all the way to the quarter-finals and would have made it further if it wasn’t for the final goal by Croatia during the penalty kicks. Croatia is probably the biggest underdog in this whole competition. An Eastern European nation, formerly part of Yugoslavia, Croatia fought hard and placed second in the competition, a feat that is quite amazing for a  nation that is tiny even compared to the rest of the European world.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The match between two former rivals, Croatia and France, began earlier today. France played exceptionally well from the start. Croatia however, had the upper hand in terms of possession. These two teams battled each other back in 1998 in the semi-finals. France came out victorious and ended up winning the whole tournament after defeating Brazil 3-0. The French team did repeat history. They are the only team to have won two world cups in the span of last two decades. This shows what potential the team has and how it has really made its mark. The game went on to a win for France 4-2. It was amazing! The players gathered together to celebrate their win, when all of a sudden, it started raining like crazy.  I guess this was an added bonus. The soaked players were in awe and happiness as they could now say they were the best in the world.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, many of the French soccer player’s parents came from other countries and immigrated to France for new opportunities. They come to France and lived in the poor area of Paris. They trained these players in training camps and eventually picked out the best of the best. This system is most prevalent in France, which is the reason that France creates the most world cup players. Many of the French players go on to play for other teams like Morocco, Portugal and Ivory Coast for example. This demonstrates the importance of immigration and the use of immigration to help create opportunity and progress.</p>\n<p>This world cup was very entertaining. In my opinion, this was one of the best world cups ever, if not the best in my lifetime. There was a lot of unpredictability and excitement which made it great.

Soon enough next season will be here, and a new class of rookies will be eager to take the league by storm. This draft class has been labeled as loaded from the lottery to the second round and it will be fascinating to see if it lives up to the hype. Here are my thoughts on some of the draft’s important selections and storylines.</p>\n<p><strong>Rookie of the Year:</strong> Marvin Bagley</p>\n<p>Even with the number two pick in the draft this year, the Kings will still probably find themselves near the bottom of the western conference standings again while they continue to develop their young talent. With that being said, Marvin Bagley will surely be looked to as the Kings go-to scorer and he’ll have many opportunities to put up big numbers. The Kings will be facing no pressure to win games this season which will allow Bagley to play freely and take his lumps while adjusting to the NBA game. With a brand new focal point of their offense, the Kings will hopefully begin to develop some sort of identity moving forward with their collection of promising young players. If Bagley took home Rookie of the Year honors that would be a step in the right direction for their franchise.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Luka Doncic</p>\n<p>Doncic’s stats will most likely be less impressive than Bagley’s, but if he and the Mavs are able to improve enough to squeak into the playoffs, his efforts just might be rewarded handsomely.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Value Pick: </strong>Robert Williams</p>\n<p>Robert Williams, out of Texas A&amp;M, was projected by some to go as high as the late lottery due to his size and athleticism but concerns about his work ethic and off-court problems caused him to fall into the late first round on draft night. So, when the Celtics swiped him up at 27 it was considered a steal and a low-risk pick for that late in the round. Williams is potentially a great fit for Boston, a team that has proven to be great defensively and could easily insert him into a backup center role behind Al Horford. They have enough offensive tools that he will only have to worry about playing defense, running the floor, and catching lobs, all of which he currently excels at. Coach Brad Stevens has been noted for his ability to work with headcases and turn them into productive players, and he will more than likely turn the physical tools of Williams into production for Boston.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Michael Porter Jr.</p>\n<p>His injuries are a massive question mark, but if Porter can live up to his potential, he could prove to be the piece that launches Denver from fringe-playoff team to contender.</p>\n<p><strong>Riskiest Pick: </strong>Trae Young</p>\n<p>Trae Young undoubtedly put up a historic season last year at Oklahoma, leading the county in both points and assists as a freshman. This being said, he did struggle in the latter half of the season when teams game-planned for him and took him out of his rhythm. Young is small in stature and it is possible that he struggles initially with the physicality of the NBA. Also, the fact that the Hawks had Luka Doncic and swapped him for Young on draft night puts some added pressure on him. Hawks fans better hope that Young lives up to expectations because if Doncic shines and Young disappoints, that draft night trade will haunt their franchise forever.</p>\n<p><em>Runner up:</em> Mo Bamba</p>\n<p>Orlando currently lacks any promising playmakers on offense so adding another defensive big with players like Collin Sexton and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander left on the board could prove costly going into the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Second Round Pick: </strong>Keita Bates Diop</p>\n<p>Bates-Diop was projected to go as high as mid-first round in many mock drafts, so it was very surprising when Minnesota was able to scoop him up with the 48th pick. KBD has all of the tools to be an effective NBA player such as defensive length, shooting ability, and experience from four years of college ball. This is an extremely low-risk pick for the T Wolves this late in the draft because he has the ability to come in and contribute right away for a team looking to return to the playoffs. Bates-Diop could also serve as a possible Andrew Wiggins replacement if the Wolves go in and seek out a deal to unload the massive contract of Wiggins, who many say does not have a good relationship with the Minnesota front office.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Jevon Carter</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies roster last year was a nightly who’s-who of former G-League and overseas players, so Carter is likely to get a decent number of minutes backing up Mike Conley.  Plus, I could not think of a better player to fit in with Memphis’s “Grit and Grind” style of play than the defensive-minded Carter.</p>\n<p><strong>Best under the radar pick: </strong>Omari Spellman</p>\n<p>Omari Spellman is probably not a well-known name to casual basketball fans because he was overshadowed by his great teammates at Villanova last year. Recognition aside, Spellman is built out of a Draymond Green-type mold and could find success early on in his career because of this. He is a proven rebounder and defender with the skill to knock down the three-ball at an efficient clip (43% in college). He does the little things on both ends by hustling and making the high-IQ plays to put his team in the best position to win. There is a place on every roster for a guy who can shoot and defend, and Spellman is in a great position to contribute for Atlanta.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Lonnie Walker</p>\n<p>Walker is a versatile guard who shows promise as a scorer and defender and should pair well with future backcourt mate Dejounte Murray in San Antonio.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83625\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83625\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/","id":996,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[995,994,993],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The 71 Year Old Man With the Cane, Ronaldo/Messi’s Fall, and the New Hero","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-06-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-1.jpg?resize=468%2C312&ssl=1","description":"With the World Cup in full swing, staff writer Omeed Soltanalipour covers some of the most exciting storylines thus far and gives his predictions for tomorrow's matches.

Two very important matches occurred earlier today. Early in the morning, Argentina and France faced off, later in the day, Portugal and Uruguay played. Never have I seen such exciting games at this stage of the competition. I will breakdown the first match played at 7:00 A.M. first.</p>\n<p>France came in with high hopes for this tournament. Not only do they have an excellent lineup of talented players, but they also have a few familiar faces with more experience and growth. Griezmann, Pogba, and Giroud all performed exceptionally well this world cup. There is one star who has just made it to the limelight however. His performance will probably go on in history, for decades to come.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>​That man is Kylian Mbappé Lottin. Born in Bondy, just shy of 19 years ago, Mbappé has risen to the ranks of the young Ronaldo. Early in the game, a quick sprint by Mbappé propelled him past the Argentinian defense into the penalty box where he was fouled. This gave the French their first opportunity as they received a penalty kick. Griezmann shot it and delivered! Then, the unthinkable happened. Right near the end of the first half, Di Maria hit it right in the net. The game was all tied up 1-1 heading to the break.</p>\n<p>Right near the start of the second half. Mercado deflects a shot by Messi and hits it in. Now, the French are on the verge of elimination! 57th minute, the French respond right back tying it up at 2 goals each. The game continues on until the return of Mbappé, who scores another goal for the French side bringing them up 3-2. Just minutes later, Mbappé comes in again and scores for France.</p>\n<p>Near the last minutes of the match, desperate Argentinian sides do whatever it takes to catch up. The 93rd minutes sees Sergio Agüero hit it in. Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough for them. Messi and company will go home tonight. France will move on to face either Uruguay or Portugal.</p>\n<p>It is great to be a football player; you get to really live a great life. Not to mention the amount of money you make. Mbappé however, does not seem too motivated by the money. The man, who scored two goals for the French, wants to donate all of his FIFA earnings to charity. What a great guy!</p>\n<p>Just a few hours later, Uruguay, led by the 71 year old Óscar Tabárez faced off against Portugal lead by, well, Ronaldo maybe? Uruguay delivered an incredible performance ousting the Portuguese. Early in the first half, Cavani, assisted by Suárez, shot it in. In the 55th minute, Pepe for Portugal responded tying this game up 1-1. This ended Uruguay’s run of 597 minutes of not conceding a goal. Pretty amazing, if you ask me! Then, in the 62nd minute, Cavani scores again for the Uruguayan side. Portugal tried very hard to make something happen, but block after block shut them down. Uruguay took this one by their teeth. It could not have happened without their head coach however.</p>\n<p>Tabárez, pictured below, suffers from a rare degenerative disease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome. It mainly affects the limbs and causes numbness and weakness. Through it all, he decided to fight through and help his team move forward. The 71 year old is nicknamed ‘El Maestro’ (The Teacher) since he used to work at a school.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1881650776\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83622\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83624\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/omeed-pic-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=468%2C305&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"468,305\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Omeed pic 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=468%2C305&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83624\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=468%2C305\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>At the end of today, two teams are through. France and Uruguay will be facing off next week on Friday at 7 A.M PST. This one will be quite the thrill. I think it will be very close, but France will have the edge. Looks like Messi and Ronaldo won’t be meeting for a match this world cup. Yet, they will still be meeting at the airport on the way back!</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we will see the World Cup hosts face off against 2010 World Cup champions. Later in the day, a powerful Croatia will face off against Denmark, who tied against France. I think Croatia and Spain will come out victorious.

But ESPN’s presentation of the 2018 NBA draft stood out from their previous blunders in ways that left me wondering how anyone else was taking in the barrel of chum that was this year’s coverage. A few looks at social media confirmed that I’m not crazy (take that, my therapist), and also not the only one to cringe at every forced player comparison made and blatantly-misguided interview question asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unfortunate that any draft day should warrant this kind of criticism because, after all, it should be about the players selected, a majority of whom are younger than half of UCSB’s undergrads. In fact, 11 of 14 players selected in this year’s lottery are 19 or younger. ESPN should not only highlight these newcomers but should provide insightful basketball analysis, instead of reality-TV content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any analysis, especially insightful, is a stretch for today’s ESPN, but some of last night’s commentary was simply disappointing. The top prospects of this year have been talked about for months now, so there was a real opportunity presented for the network to capture the long-awaited selections with a dialogue pointing to the next step for the draftees and their respective franchises. Instead, the well-known highlights of each player were reiterated with little acknowledgement of where the players were headed. It doesn’t take the notion of draft night to once again explain Deandre Ayton’s athleticism, or Luka Doncic’s success overseas. On draft night, it should be about what’s next for them in the league. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the immediate moments following the announced destination of each prospect, the chance to talk NBA basketball was missed. In the case of Ayton, a player expected to go No. 1 in the draft for quite a while, his destination was only touched upon. The Suns have exceptional young talent to welcome Ayton; however, the brief mention of Ayton’s future teammates was underwhelming and hardly informative. Perhaps the aspect of time between picks hampored any detailed analysis, so maybe the section of the show devoted to player introductions should’ve been a time for actual NBA commentary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Player introductions, which were done for the first (and hopefully last) time in draft history last night, should’ve been the first sign of botched coverage. Most of the expected lottery picks were featured walking down the stage with family members or friends alongside them, which is great for celebrating the players, except every player already gets plenty of camera time once the actual draft begins. Players are shown, oftentimes with their friends and family, awaiting picks at their tables, on stage with commissioner Adam Silver, being interviewed after they’re picked, and the abundance of media obligations awaiting them after their interviews. Why would the players need even more screen-time? Because the ESPN commentators actually have that little of importance to say. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"766937373\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83582\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83583\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/2018-nba-draft-logo-640x360/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640×360\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83583\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning with Chauncey Billups, who earned my respect as a player during his Detroit years, Billups’ segment of player comparisons was terrible and frankly a waste of time. It’s understandable why comparing young draft picks to past and present NBA players is helpful in characterizing a players’ potential, but some comparisons appeared forced and few were reasonable. Aside from the weird trend of matching the race of pick and compared player, Billups failed to match playstyles altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaren Jackson Jr., selected fourth, was compared to Joakim Noah. As Billups made this comparison, Jackson Jr.’s highlights were shown with him spreading the floor and hitting threes. Joakim Noah, as anyone who’s watched him play should know, isn’t a big three point shooter, or shooter in general. Noah has an NBA career three point percentage of 0.00. Billups had to have done some preparation for the top prospects and their comparisons, and obviously it’s uncertain how every draftee will turn out, but some of his choices made it seem like he was drawing names out of segregated hats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the racially-aligned player comparisons weren’t awkward enough, the post-draft interviews for each player picked up the slack. After being picked, shaking the commissioners’ hand and walking across the stage, the players then faced a barrage of poor interview questions. Simply pointless questions regarding “the moment” and “what their team can expect” were repeated for each pick, with equally repetitive answers. How else are they supposed to feel? They just got drafted by an NBA team as a teenager, we’re sure that’s awful. And immediately after being drafted they had to sell themselves as a player again? It was ridiculous and a blatant move by ESPN trying to generate drama.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing out among the interviews was Colin Sexton’s. Following his selection at 8th overall by Cleveland, Sexton was coaxed by the interviewer to make a pitch for LeBron to stay. Talk about awkward. Anything the Cavs do to retain The King will likely include packaging their newest draft pick in a trade for another star, just like they did with Andrew Wiggins in 2014. As if Sexton was supposed to say, ‘LeBron please stay, I promise I’ll know the score during the final seconds of a playoff game.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of it all, ESPN reporter and columnist Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted out virtually every pick before it happened, which only cheapens the draft coverage itself even further. Maybe my sports expectations are too high for a Disney-owned company, and maybe the point of the show is to be just that, a show. But, the difficulty of finding non-conglomerate, real-time draft news should indicate where the dominating national sports coverage is heading. If the NBA draft is developing into a reality show, how soon until other ESPN/ABC (both Disney) NBA events like All-Star Weekend and End of Year Awards are ruined? Oh wait. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Taking an explosive Milwaukee team to 7 games, beating a stacked Philly team in just 5, and taking LeBron James and his cradled Cavs to an eventful Eastern Conference Finals game 7.</p>\n<p>The Celts saw their season slip through their hands in the last few minutes of that game 7, when LeBron took over and the team couldn’t hit a shot to save their lives.</p>\n<p>But despite coming up short in the 2017-2018 season, what lies ahead of this Boston team is perhaps a brighter future than any other franchise in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The Celtics will be legitimate title contenders for years to come, and here’s why…</p>\n<p>Not only do the Celtics have a General Manger mastermind in Danny Ainge (trading the number one pick to obtain Jayson Tatum <em>and</em> a subsequent first rounder?! Amazing!). But they also have the second coming of Greg Popovich in coach Brad Stevens, they’re loaded with young talent, and since acquiring Hayward and Irving, they are no doubt an enticing location for any free agent serious about winning some hardware.</p>\n<p>In order to fully understand the firepower of Boston, it is quintessential to look at the antecedent state of their roster in which they ended their season, understand just what the Celtics have to look forward to in their future draft picks, and take note of what they will look like come training camp when No.11 and No. 20 suit-up once again.</p>\n<p>In terms of their draft picks, let’s take a look at what the Green Machine has in their arsenal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Celts are in complete ownership of all of their first-round picks going forward. For this year’s upcoming draft, Boston sits at No. 27 overall, barring any trades they may choose to engage in.</li>\n<li>Remember the trade heard ‘round the world? When Ainge deciphered that he could get the same person at No. 3 in the 2017 draft that he could get at No. 1? Remember when everyone said Philly “won” that trade that got them Markelle Fultz? The same Fultz who got to watch the NBA Playoffs the same way the rest of us did – without stepping on the court…? Well, because of Ainge’s gutsy call, the C’s earned the Sacramento Kings’ first round pick in 2019, by way of trade with the 76ers.</li>\n<li>Boston will get the L.A. Clippers’ first round pick in 2019 if it ends up being No. 15 or later, as selections 1 to 14 are protected. If the Celtics don’t end up getting the pick in 2019, then it reverts to a 2020 pick, under same restrictions as the one in 2019. Consequently, if the Celtics don’t get that L.A. pick in 2020, then they will receive the Clippers’ 2022 second round pick.</li>\n<li>Memphis’ first round pick in 2019 will go to the C’s if it turns out to be No. 9 or later. But if that doesn’t go Boston’s way, then in 2020 if the Grizzlies’ selection is No. 7 or later, that pick will go straight to Boston. If those two scenarios don’t lean in Boston’s favor, then the Celtics will receive the Grizzlies’ first round pick in 2021 with no restrictions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is clear that the Celts have more than a couple draft picks up their sleeve. It cannot be ignored though, that draft picks are only as good as the players the franchise chooses to pick up. But given Boston’s track record of successful drafting, that doesn’t seem to be something the C’s are too worried about.</p>\n<p>Boston’s current roster impressed many, by getting within one game of the NBA Finals without their two all-stars.</p>\n<p>Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Jayson Tatum, and their coach Brad Stevens, are just a few reasons why.</p>\n<p>You would have been a fool to think an offensive powerhouse like Tatum would’ve been anything less than effective this past season. After all, he did come from Duke. However, not many foresaw him developing as much as he did as fast as he did.</p>\n<p>With Hayward going down, it forced Tatum to step up and grow into the force he is inevitably becoming before our very eyes. He effectively plays both ends of the court, and even got a highlight-worthy dunk on LeBron James late in his rookie season.</p>\n<p>20-year old Tatum may not be able to get into a bar just yet, but he’s already got into the hearts of every Celtic fan around the world. Tatum is just a piece of the puzzle that makes up the future of the C’s franchise.</p>\n<p>Boston is extremely versatile, and their roster is loaded with pieces that just “fit”. You’ve got players from the veteran Al Horford, who is a critical piece of the Celtics’ frontcourt and leadership, to the young and explosive dunk-machine Jaylen Brown who is also a force on defense.</p>\n<p>You’d be remiss not to consider Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Marcus Smart, and the other competitors that played a big role in the Celts’ great playoff run. But you can contend that a few of those pieces are somewhat disposable if you’re owner Wyc Grousbeck and GM Danny Ainge and are looking to acquire other players.</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that the Celtics may be considering trading Brown and some picks to move up in the draft to gain a shot at big Center Mo Bamba from the University of Texas. But if you know anything about Ainge, these rumors can possibly prove to be nothing but smoke and mirrors, especially since the C’s didn’t trade down in the draft last year until the very last possible second and shocked the world by trading for the third overall pick.</p>\n<p>Brad Stevens has a coaching system that mimics the great Bill Belichick’s, and that became abundantly evident this past season.</p>\n<p>The “next man up” approach the Celtics have adapted is similar to what the New England Patriots refer to as “Do Your Job”, meaning that every player on the roster needs to be ready to come to play, no matter the game or the week.</p>\n<p>Stevens was such a big influence and genius play-caller with the young injury-induced roster he had this past season, so one can only imagine what his greatness can achieve in several years to come with a fully healthy roster.</p>\n<p>Looking at the final minutes of the ECF game 7, and the struggles Boston had scoring, it is evident that Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward are much needed and will have a huge impact once healthy and can push this already good team to become a great one.</p>\n<p>One can’t know for sure, but if those two all-stars were on the roster, some say we would have been watching a very different NBA Finals right now instead of watching Steph Curry and Klay Thompson run circles around JR Smith and Tristan Kardashian (I had to).</p>\n<p>When you consider the current pieces they have, the pending state of the team when Hayward and Irving come back, and the vast amount of picks the Celts have at their disposal, you can easily proclaim that Boston clearly has the best “process” around. And that process didn’t even involve tanking (looking at you, Philly).</p>\n<p>With LeBron’s future in Cleveland hanging in the balance, you could attest that Boston and Philadelphia might be the best two teams in the East starting next season. But even if LeBron does stay in the East, he definitely won’t have an automatic bid to the Finals like he’s had these past 8 years. These ain’t your mommas Boston Celtics, folks. This team is for real.</p>\n<p>The Celtics are set up to win for years to come.</p>\n<p>Who knows? They may even win not 1… not 2… not 3… not 4… not 5…</p>\n<p>On second thought, the last person to make that prognostication ended up getting that amount of NBA Finals losses instead of

Tournament and never won, which comes out to around 40 percent of the national pool. Yet, thanks to the efforts of the 1990 squad, the Gauchos will always be part of the select group of winners at the tournament, something that conference rivals Fullerton, CSUN, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and Cal Poly cannot claim.</p>\n<p>It takes a truly special team, or at least exceptional luck to cross that boundary from loser to winner. This year, Marshall, Buffalo, and UMBC’s shocking upsets removed themselves from that list of winless squads and those fan bases will always remember the day they became winners. While the Gauchos are in the midst of a seven year absence from the tournament, we will always remember the one time we were winners.</p>\n<p>It is March 15th, 1990. The venue: Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee. Seeded 9th in the Southeast Region, UCSB is led by the nation’s second leading rebounder Eric “The Freeze” McArthur at 13 per game and sharpshooter and fellow senior Carrick DeHart, who led the Gauchos in scoring at 15.9 PPG. Big man Junior Gary Gray, and sophomore wings Paul Johnson and Lucius Davis make the rest of the Gauchos core. All year they played an unselfish brand of basketball, relying on a suffocating defense and good rebounding, coached by Jerry Pimm. DeHart and McArthur nearly made it to the NBA with the Boston Celtics before playing careers that would take them all across the world.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The team set on stopping the Gauchos from reaching their first tournament victory is the Houston Cougars, led by forward and eventual two-time NBA Champion Carl Herrera and only 6 years removed from the Phi Slama Jama-era teams that went to back-to-back championship games.</p>\n<p>Unlike this year’s first time tournament winners, UCSB wasn’t considered a heavy underdog heading into their game. Their seniors had NCAA tournament experience from two years prior and during the season, the Gauchos had given UNLV their last taste of defeat before the Runnin’ Rebels would win the National Championship that year. UCSB had the potential to play with the best teams in the country, but inconsistency had plagued them all season with losses to mediocre Iowa and Pacific, twice.</p>\n<p>Hard fought throughout, the Gauchos topped the Houston Cougars on the strength of their defense and rebounding, their grind-it-out style a relic of an older era before 3 pointers reigned. In the first half, UCSB controlled the boards particularly well with 17 second chance points. The biggest highlight was a beautiful lob alley-oop dunk from Paul Johnson to Eric McArthur. Despite the advantage in rebounding and turnover differential, UCSB’s poor shooting percentage led to the game being tied at halftime.</p>\n<p>After a long two pointer by Lucius Davis, a sophomore who in two years would achieve Big West Conference Player of the Year, UCSB led by single digits throughout the entire second half until a late run by Houston put the Cougars in the lead by a single point with a minute to go. The Gauchos would rely on what they had all season in order to pull out a victory. An air ball caught by McArthur and put back for an easy bucket put the Gauchos in the lead and after McArthur sunk a free throw on the next possession, the Gauchos led by 2 with 20 seconds left. As Houston tried to send the ball into the post for a score as time wound down, the Gauchos’ heart and soul, Eric “The Freeze” McArthur stole the ball. Just like that the game was over.</p>\n<p>McArthur would finish with a stuffed statsheet of 20 Points, 11 Rebounds, 5 Blocks and 4 Steals. Thanks to the near superhuman effort of McArthur and support from forward Gary Gray, who finished with 15 points and 9 rebounds, UCSB left the list of eternal losers at the NCAA tournament and joined the victors, a place their opponent had reached in 1961.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos greatest moment, immortalized in a grainy TV broadcast uploaded to YouTube with less than 1000 views, took place on a hideous orange court in Knoxville. “VOLS” surrounds the center court logo, a picture of the state of Tennessee. A small dark circle reading “NCAA” in the middle of the normal logo remained the only clue that this game meant more than a normal regular season tilt. To call the stadium half-empty would be optimistic. Still, 2,000 miles away from campus, as the clock wound down, the cheer of “Gauchos! Gauchos!” rang through Thompson-Boling Arena.</p>\n<p>Watch UCSB’s NCAA Victory Over Houston in full <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76OFx8yLFm0\">here</a></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The Gauchos were last in the NCAA tournament seven years ago.

hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. The world’s most watched sporting event is missing usual contenders like Italy, Netherlands, and long-running qualifiers like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and the United States are also missing. In their place, underdogs like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia, the most Arab nations to qualify for a single World Cup. Panama and Iceland will make their first appearances in the Tournament, with Iceland being the smallest country to ever qualify with a population less than 350,000. With old contenders rebuilding around new stars, and the presence of some surprising teams, this year’s World Cup might be the most unpredictable in some time. That won’t stop The Daily Nexus though! Here are our 5 boldest predictions for the World Cup!</p>\n<p><em>Russia Will Not Make It Out of Group A</em></p>\n<p>Russia has a rich history of competitive soccer. They qualified for Brazil 2014 by winning their group outright over Portugal. They’ve reached as high as third on the FIFA Rankings in 1996 and their average position in the FIFA rankings, which has existed since 1993, is a very respectable 23rd. Add in the traditionally non-threatening presence of Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the host country’s group, Russia would normally easily skate through to at least a second place showing, if not challenge Uruguay for the top spot. However, no points are awarded for tradition at the World Cup, and Russia will have to earn it’s spot in the knockout stage with perhaps their worst team in history. The FIFA Rankings has Russia at its lowest spot in history this month at 66th. They have not won a single game this year and their best recent result was a tie with Spain, where they gave up three goals in St. Petersburg at the end of last year. To put it shortly, Russia is one of the few teams in the tournament that has been steadily trending downward over recent months. After Egypt’s Mohamed Salah’s record-breaking performance this year at Liverpool, the Pharaohs’ one-man show should be enough against Russia’s porous defense to advance Egypt past the host nation, who may become the second host team to not reach the knockout stage after South Africa in 2010.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>France Won’t Get To The Knockout Stage</em></p>\n<p>France has been raved about in early previews of the World Cup as the deepest team in the tournament. You could even make a competitive squad from the French players, who did not get the invite to Russia. Led by Manchester United standout Paul Pogba, and a veteran captain in goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, France is deserving of its status as a contender this year. Just like they were in 2002 as defending champs or in 2010 as defending runner-ups, when they couldn’t get past the group stage. France is obviously a favorite on paper, but some French media are worried about this version of the squad. “This French team lacks character and mentality”, said Christophe Dugarry after a friendly loss to Colombia. Of perhaps all the major contenders, France may be the team most likely to surprise us all and flame-out in the group stage like they did in 2010.</p>\n<p><em>All 5 South American Teams Win Their Groups</em></p>\n<p>We’ve already touched on Uruguay’s favorable Group A, but do not be surprised if the majority of the groups are won by South American squads. Argentina and Brazil are contenders to win the whole tournament, let alone their group. Colombia drew perhaps the most wide-open group with their only real roadblock being a one-man show in Robert Lewandowski’s Poland and an underrated Senegal team. Still, Colombia, led by James Rodríguez, the leading goalscorer at Brazil 2014, should be a slight favorite to top the group.</p>\n<p>While Peru will be making their first appearance since 1982, make no mistake they are not to be underestimated. The last time they lost a match was to Brazil in 2016! That’s not a bad streak to bring into the Cup and they are easily one of the hottest teams entering the tournament. We’ve already seen France’s penchant for struggling in the groups now and again and if Peru can take care of them, then Australia and Denmark shouldn’t be any more challenging. Even with star Paolo Guerrero sidelined by a doping suspension, Jefferson Farfán and the rest of Peru’s team will continue their hot streak and top Group C.</p>\n<p><em>3 African Teams Make the Knockout Stage Setting a New Record</em></p>\n<p>We’ve already touched on a talented Egyptian squad led by Mohamed Salah, and an underrated Senegal who should only need to beat an unbalanced Polish team to take second in Group H. Nigeria is another squad that has a shot to make it through. They have a solid group, but have had goalkeeping issues with 19 year old Francis Uzoho the likely starter. If he can hold it together for them between the sticks, it possible they could beat out plucky Iceland and solid Croatia. Those three seem to be Africa’s best shot of getting to the knockouts, but crazy things happen in the World Cup and maybe Tunisia or Morocco make some noise. Three squads in the knockouts would be an unprecedented result for African soccer, and while it is a bold prediction, don’t be surprised to see Africa cement itself as the clear third best soccer region behind Europe and South America.</p>\n<p><em>A South American Team Will Win The World Cup</em></p>\n<p>Argentina and Brazil have always been huge soccer powers, but have been lacking in World Cup victories for a while now. Europe has won 3 straight an all-time record, including the first European win in South America with Germany’s dominant run last year. On top of that, South America has not won a World Cup on European soil since Brazil’s win in Sweden in 1958. Here’s why it could change this year. Brazil is highly motivated after last years embarrassment against Germany in the semi-finals and they’re dialed in after a recent 1-0 victory over the defending champs. Messi wants to cement his status as the greatest of all time and perhaps only a World Cup victory will bring that to him. After European dominance on the sport’s biggest stage it’s time stars like for Neymar, Messi, James, and Cavani to reestablish South America as the center of the soccer world. Brazil breaks through for another World Cup championship, while Argentina and Colombia do serious damage in this tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/","id":1365,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[1364,1363,1362],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Warriors Vs.

\r\n</script> \n<p>They call him the King, and who wouldn’t? I mean, the man in question has reached the pinnacle of<br>\ncompetition in every season for the past eight years. LeBron James’s jersey sales are impeccable and he<br>\nsets a precedent for every young baller. Not only is James’s character one to look up to, but his work<br>\nethic is that of a champion.</p>\n<p>LeBron himself, however, doesn’t have the entertainment factor to support the entire NBA. What<br>\nshines from Jordan is the fact that during his six years competing in the NBA Finals, average viewership<br>\nwas the highest it&amp;#39;s ever been, barring the 1987 Lakers-Celtics, Magic-Bird, rivalry matchup.</p>\n<p>Yet the NBA was plagued after Jordan’s final championship appearance. Come 1999, average<br>\nviewership slipped to just above 11 million after reaching nearly 19 million average viewers in 1998<br>\nfollowing a steady rise in the recent five years. Since Jordan, average viewership in the NBA Finals<br>\nremains low, with the ceiling reaching 12 million viewers in 2001, 7 million less than the NBA’s peak in<br>\n1998, the last time the G.O.A.T. competed.</p>\n<p>As LeBron’s championship woes continued in Cleveland, following his first appearance in the Finals<br>\nwhich culminated in a devastating sweep in 2007, average viewership curbed to approximately 6 million<br>\naverage viewers, the lowest it’s been in over 40 years throughout the entire modern NBA era.<br>\nThe King finally got a taste of a ring in Miami, a flavor he so longed for his hometown fans to indulge in.<br>\nYet as he shifted gears back to Cleveland, a new duo of stars emerged in the West: cue the Splash<br>\nBrothers.</p>\n<p>Steph Curry and Klay Thompson brought significance to NBA level competition by reinventing the<br>\ngame. Kids want to emulate Curry’s shot. Players want to resemble the impact that the Splash Brothers<br>\nhave on a game when they are healthy. LeBron displays superhuman athleticism and strength, but the<br>\nWarriors make it look relatable — they have fun playing this game. LeBron’s jersey sales are impeccable<br>\n… but Steph Curry’s are off the charts.</p>\n<p>And it’s no surprise that the top two teams in merchandise revenue are those two that have been in the<br>\nNBA Finals for each the past four seasons.<br>\nOver the past three years, the average viewership has reached its height since 2001. Fans love to see<br>\na plethora of talent displayed in the championship games, but LeBron’s team seems to lack the star<br>\npower that we’ve seen in the past. Similarly, over the past three years, average viewership has declined<br>\nfrom 2015.</p>\n<p>Viewership peaked when Steph and Klay shocked the world in 2015 by dropping the King. Followed by<br>\na slight decline in viewership in 2016, Lebron and Kyrie bounced back and dropped the best record the<br>\nNBA had ever seen. 2017 brought Kevin Durant and suddenly the outcome became as predictable at the<br>\nstart of the year as it was at the end as viewership once again dipped during the 5-game series.</p>\n<p>The NBA’s motto is “Where Amazing Happens,” but if the result is gradually and increasingly far from<br>\nmysterious, is the NBA really “amazing” anymore?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Can the One Man Army Win It All By Himself?</em></p>\n<p>Brandon Victor</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What else is there to say about LeBron James that we haven’t already heard? Despite thousands of minutes on his 33 year old body, despite all science suggesting he should be slowing down, the King continues to get better and more efficient, culminating in arguably the finest postseason of his career.</p>\n<p>Once again, LeBron James has defied all logic this postseason, carrying a team of washed up stars that likely would have gotten swept by the Pacers without him to the NBA finals.</p>\n<p>Through it all, LeBron has reminded us why he is the best player in the world. This postseason, despite shouldering a 36 percent usage rate, James has averaged 34 points, 8.8 assists, and 9.2 rebounds while still shooting a remarkable 54 percent from the field. With 13 double-doubles and 3 triple-doubles already this postseason, LeBron has solidified his name in the greatest of all time conversation.</p>\n<p>But can he do it all alone? Unless Kevin Love– who was a minus 18 in the Boston series– comes back from his concussion a brand-new player, he will once again be trying to drag this team of misfits and washed-up players past the finish line. And although LeBron displayed his greatness during the Boston series, he also seemed incredibly fatigued at times, missing rotations on the defensive end that he would never have missed in the past.</p>\n<p>LeBron will still get his buckets against Golden State, especially while Andre Iguodala remains sidelined. Despite the tenacious defense of Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, no player in the NBA can consistently guard LeBron James. While he may no longer have the explosiveness he used to, James has mastered his craft, using his strength to finish at the rim and then coming back and hitting a step-back on the very next play.</p>\n<p>Expect a vintage performance from the King this series– a player who has proven time and time again that he comes to play when the pressure is on. Similarly to 2015– when Kyrie Irving and Love both got injured– LeBron will do everything in his power to fight and claw his way for his fourth title. Unfortunately, just like in 2015, the best player in the world can’t beat a team as deep and talented as the Warriors just by himself.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 6 of the May 31</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83426\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83426\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/","id":977,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[976,975,974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Warriors Vs.

Iguodala provides defensive versatility to the Warriors starting five, which allows them to throw different looks at LeBron James throughout the series, which could give him problems. However, Iguodala’s veteran leadership might be the most important thing he adds to Golden State.</p>\n<p>He acts like a second coach on the floor by instructing players on where to go and calming everyone down when they start getting too loose with the ball. The versatility he provides is also apparent on offense, where he can play a point-forward role with the second unit or the starters, allowing the numerous great shooters on their squad to run off screens and find their shot. Iguodala has been ruled out for Game 1 and he will be reevaluated before Game 2, so the Warriors will have to make it work with Kevon Looney or Jordan Bell in his place for now. But if he is able to get back on the floor, even if he isn’t fully healthy, his effect on his team cannot be understated.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>KEVIN LOVE: </strong></p>\n<p>It’s weird to say that an All-Star can be considered an X-Factor to his team, but Kevin Love has been up-and-down throughout the playoffs and he was injured for basically each of the last two games the Cavs played against Boston. Love is still in concussion protocol and his status for Game 1 is uncertain, but if he can get back on the floor and contribute, that opens up a lot of opportunities for his team.</p>\n<p>His best performances in the playoffs came against the Raptors, where he averaged 20.5 points for the series and was clearly playing his most confident basketball. More importantly, when Love was an offensive threat that commanded attention, the other role players on Cleveland were able to find their groove and start producing. If Love can channel his play from the Raptors series and stay healthy, he will take some of the load off of LeBron, and the Cavs might just be able to catch the Warriors off guard and give them a challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sizing Up Each Squad’s Starting Line-Up</em></p>\n<p>Andrew Bishop</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors feature impressive depth amongst their bench players, this upcoming NBA Finals matchup will be centered around both teams’ formidable starting lineups. Of the 10 players who will be on the court when the Finals kicks off this Wednesday, six made appearances in this year’s all-star game, with the Cavaliers’ LeBron James and the Warriors’ Stephen Curry serving as captains of the East and West all-star teams respectively. While this will be the fourth consecutive finals meeting for the Warriors and the Cavs, the position matchups have changed significantly since last season. Let’s break down each of the starting lineups and who they will be facing this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POINT GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Filling out the point guard position for the Cavs will be seasoned veteran George Hill, who is renowned for his three-point shooting abilities. Hill’s shot has fallen off slightly since the start of the postseason, and he will likely have a tough time competing with the Warriors’ Stephen Curry, one of the league’s most heralded point guards and three-point shooters. Curry’s ability to quickly come off screens and drain deep shots will likely put Hill in a tough spot throughout the series, and his PPG average throughout the postseason (24.8) dwarfs Hill’s (9.7).</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>SHOOTING GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The two guard position will likely favor the Warriors as well, with all-star Klay Thompson facing the Cavs’ veteran J.R. Smith. Like Hill, Smith makes his living behind the arc, leaving more room for LeBron James to do his thing. Smith has shot 36.8 percent on three point attempts this season, and he is known to catch fire when it counts, hitting multiple shots that helped the Cavs capture a Finals victory in 2016. However, Smith will be forced to contend with Klay Thompson, who has been hot this postseason, notching 20.5 PPG and shooting 42.6 percent from three. Thompson is one of the purest shooters in the league, and the Warriors’ offensive system will likely get him multiple open looks, regardless of how hard J.R. plays up on him. While Thompson has a tendency to fall off in big games, if he’s left open, he’s practically automatic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>SMALL FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The small forward matchup will be the one to watch throughout the series. The Warriors will ante up with their star player, Kevin Durant, who has dominated the playoffs with his precise shooting, notching 29.0 [[ok]] PPG. Durant has proved to be a challenge to opponents on both sides of the ball, but he is slightly outmatched by his counterpart on the Cavaliers. LeBron James is arguably the best player of all time, and while Kevin Durant can sometimes hang with him, there is no way to completely shut him down. LeBron almost single-handedly carried the Cavs throughout the postseason, averaging an astonishing 34.0 PPG, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.8 assists. LeBron does it all, and if teams attempt to double him, he has other shooters on the perimeter to back him up. He is a force to be reckoned with, and he certainly has the upper hand in this matchup.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POWER FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both teams feature small forwards at the four position, with the Warriors starting Kevon Looney, and the Cavs starting Jeff Green in place of the injured Kevin Love. Looney has not done a whole lot during the playoffs, with about 4.5 PPG and 4.9 rebounds, and is mostly just filling in due to injuries. He will likely be outmatched by Green, whose point production helped LeBron get an edge over the Boston Celtics in the last two games of the Eastern Conference Finals. Green has averaged only about 8.3 PPG this postseason, but if he can turn it up during the Finals, he could prove to be even more of an asset to Cleveland.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CENTER: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Golden State and Cleveland fill their five spots with power forwards, operating under more of a “small ball” system. Cleveland’s Tristan Thompson has not lived up to his extensive salary, especially during the playoffs, with a quiet 6.1 PPG and 6.1 rebounds. He will face off against the Warriors’ all-star, Draymond Green, who has been nothing short of studly when it comes to crashing boards, notching 11.6 rebounds per game. Green averages about 11.1 PPG, and while his three point shot has fallen off since the Warriors’ last finals appearance, he is still deadly from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p><em>A version

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When fans think of professional athletes, most tend to lean towards believing that these are people with great mental health. The reason is because these are people that reach the highest level of their individual field and something like that cannot be done without a strong sense of confidence, both internally and externally.</p>\n<p>However, as athletes are now reminding us today, that is not at all the case. As Kevin Love said, everyone is going through something.<br>\nAnd that is especially true at the collegiate level. College players are expected to juggle so much, whether it be their play on the court or their academics off of it. Like many, these transitions are tough, but they can be combated with experience and a continual growth mentally.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Max Heidegger has had an interesting start to his college career. This past season, Heidegger became the face of the UCSB men’s basketball team becoming a breakout star who averaged a team-high 19.1 points per game on a very efficient 43 percent shooting and 40 percent from beyond the arc.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Malibu, California native was one of the key reasons for the Gauchos’ historic turnaround, winning 23 games this year compared to winning six the previous season. The 23 wins also tied the program’s best mark for wins in a single season.</p>\n<p>However, even he could attest that in a time of winning that the balance of everything never comes easy.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard in general, everyday. It’s really tough balancing your time because obviously you want to relax a lot and hang out, but it’s tough with school, obviously, and having your basketball obligations you have to do and then also you have to work on your game on your own,” Heidegger said. “Balancing everything and getting your time organized is really tough. For me personally, having other things to do that aren’t basketball or school, other obligations, it gets really tough because I’m not free to do anything until six or seven, especially in season.”</p>\n<p>And yet, it hasn’t been an easy ride for the sophomore. In his freshman campaign, Heidegger averaged just 7.6 points per game and shot 26.8 percent from the field and 20 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Along with that, the former high school All-CIF player was battling injuries, something that has bothered him throughout his career.<br>\n“It was really tough on me personally. Right before the year I got hurt again, in high school I had a ton of injury problems so that was a little disheartening for me, but it was kind of after the season it came to a point where I could feel sorry for myself but I knew I had things I had to do to improve myself and so I went out there and did it. But it was for sure difficult during the season and after,” Heidegger said.</p>\n<p>A lot of times, we as fans take these things for granted. Heidegger has clearly transformed his game and it’s easy to chalk it up to new coaching or schemes but, in reality, it was a lot of hard work both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>New Head Coach Joe Pasternack and his staff certainly played a huge role in the turnaround of the UCSB men’s basketball program, but at the end of the day players are the ones who make the real difference come game time.</p>\n<p>In his first game this season, Heidegger was amazing. The sophomore led the Gauchos to a roaring 85-66 win over a talented North Dakota State squad in which he scored 33 points. Heidegger was definitely ready come game one, but not without a lot of hard work before that.</p>\n<p>“Going into this past season I was a little anxious especially early on. Right before our first scrimmage I was anxious, because I hadn’t played in a long time and I didn’t play particularly how I wanted to so I was putting a lot of pressure on myself,” Heidegger said. “I was definitely anxious before this year but obviously it all worked out. I mean, it certainly wasn’t easy, after last year. It was tough, it was tough on all of us. We all as a team, over summer, pulled ourselves up and pulled ourselves together.”</p>\n<p>Heidegger carried the momentum of that first game and parlayed it into a great season, one that was filled with many awards, smiles and most importantly, wins. This season was not perfect for the guard as he still struggled at times but, overall it was a much different experience.</p>\n<p>“Obviously things are easy when things are good, shots are going in and you’re winning games it’s easy to be positive and it’s easy to have confidence,” Heidegger said. “I had some games this year when I struggled but even still, playing well and having a great year, it’s tough as a competitor to swallow that, to play bad and go back to the drawing board. I felt that from last year my freshman year helped me out a lot in terms of maturing and dealing with not everything going my way in college. It helped a lot with dealing with adversity.”<br>\nAnd even in a season where the Gauchos were winning games and having players like Max contribute at a high level there are always bumps that could get in the way.</p>\n<p>This year, UCSB dealt with two major incidents off the court and completely out of their control. The first being the Thomas Fire, a natural disaster that affected an entire community.</p>\n<p>“It was super tough on all of us, mentally. One day we come back to Santa Barbara and then we evacuate. We don’t know if we’re going to play, when we’re going to play. It’s hard to focus on games when you have those outside factors. Especially because we’re having to practice at high schools in Santa Barbara because our gym is smoked out. We walk in there and you can smell the fire and ash in the gym. Stuff like that was hard on us, staying in hotels in LA waiting for games,” Heidegger said.</p>\n<p>I knew it was tough on all of us, but that’s when the team part came into play. We tried not to focus on it too much and just take it in strides, but looking back it was hard going place to place and not knowing what was happening. We thought we were in the clear and then with the mudslides we couldn’t drive anywhere, it was a whole one thing after another. I knew for us it was obviously difficult but I knew it was difficult in the community as well but I know for our guys it was tough. We had a good enough support system between us and obviously our coaches to push through that,” Heidegger added.</p>\n<p>The second thing the Gauchos had to deal with was the Hawai’i bomb scare on the morning of January 13th. Thinking they were just going to play a game that night and nothing else, many of the UCSB athletes were still sleeping when people of Hawai’i were sent an emergency alert that a missile was headed for the country.</p>\n<p>“That was a very weird and interesting experience. We tried not to think about it too much. Once it was over, for me personally, I brushed it off. I know a couple other players and all of us were a little bit shook still but we tried our best to shake it off, but it was super weird,” Heidegger said. “The whole day seemed weird but we really wanted to get out of there. It was a very odd experience. We’re sitting there in the morning thinking if this thing hits then that’s a wrap for us.”</p>\n<p>Athletes do amazing things on their respective field of play, but they are not superhuman. And when sudden tragedies strike they too are affected.</p>\n<p>Heidegger is just one example of an athlete who has overcome plenty of adversity in just two years and you could chalk that up to a lot of things. The great thing about sports is the feeling of camaraderie and that’s something that can’t be replicated.</p>\n<p>“It feels awesome to have guys that you can trust and talk to. At the end of the day a lot of those guys I’m still going to be talking to. It’s a great feeling to have that camaraderie and friendship,” Heidegger said. “Once I’m done playing that’s probably going to be one of the parts I miss the most, being with my teammates and even just sitting in the locker room talking, hanging out. It’s great to be part of the team.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, athletes are people too. They also need time away from what they love doing, they also need time to be with their friends and they also need to be weary of taking care of themselves mentally.</p>\n<p>It is easy for us to constantly come down on athletes after hard games. There were people who came down hard on Max after he only scored three points in a Gaucho loss to Long Beach State this season. But it’s important to remember that, like us, athletes are people, and their struggles are something we should sympathize with, not belittle.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

I had expressed interest in playing football, but my parents had wanted me to take some form of self-defense classes and threw me into the United Studios of Self Defense — a mixture of Kung-fu and Shaolin Kempo Karate.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 10 years I spent doing martial arts, I saw many people from every walk of life come and go, but most of the concrete figures in the dojo were men. Being a young girl in a male-dominated sport certainly had its ups and downs. It could be incredibly disheartening to feel lesser than my peers simply because of our biological differences, but by that same notion, it was incredibly empowering to feel just as accomplished, if not more so, than the boys.</p>\n<p>It is really disorienting to be put on a pedestal for your gender when you’re six years old. As a child I lacked the self-awareness to realize it, but ultimately it became clear as I grew older that every time I stepped into the dojo, I was representing my entire gender. Being a spokesperson for all women — specifically young women — was a huge burden to bear, and I constantly felt as though I had to prove myself in the name of my gender. Prior to my time in karate, I had only done activities that aligned with my gender, like ballet, gymnastics and an all-girls soccer league. But in this space I was an outlier, completely outnumbered by boys.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up in the dojo played an interesting role in the development of my mental health. Meditation played a big role in karate: Every class and private lesson started and ended with a moment of meditation. Mindfulness and a clear headspace were always preached, but at the same time, being in a male-dominated space had a big impact on my state of mind. Acting too much “like a girl” was a disadvantage, and the effort to suppress the feminine aspects of my personality was both mentally and emotionally taxing. I hated crying in front of the boys, and ultimately I became too scared to do things that would leave me in a vulnerable position.</p>\n<p>After getting punched in the face at a tournament, I stopped fighting for about six months because I was afraid of getting caught off guard again, even though that’s the nature of the sport. Karate has had a lasting effect on my mental state; I am hyper-vigilant of my surroundings — some could maybe say paranoid — and I still flinch when anyone comes close to my face. When I find myself in potentially dangerous situations I always try to strategize a way out.</p>\n<p>The most challenging aspect of being a woman in a male-centric sport was recognizing my limitations and differences from my opponents and trying to use that to my advantage. There were only three other girls in my age group during my 10 years of karate, all of whom quit before I earned my black belt. This gender disparity left the vast majority of my interactions, including sparring, with boys. Sparring is a form of fighting, often done with protective gear like helmets, gloves, shin guards and mouth guards. We would also practice open-hand fighting with no gear, called kumite.</p>\n<p>To say I got pummeled by men — both children and adults — would be an understatement. When I was 12, I was in the fifth hour of a seven-hour-long test and was paired up for a sparring match with a 20-something-year-old man who had an advantage of at least a full foot and 150 lbs. He did not take it easy on me, and the experience resulted in my first-ever panic attack. I will never forget how he yelled, “Hit me! Hit me harder!” as his fists beat me over the head and his kicks jabbed me in the solar plexus.</p>\n<p>That being said, some of the most vicious and brutal fighters I have ever engaged in combat with have been women. The first fist ever to punch me in the face belonged to a very large eight-year-old who absolutely annihilated me in a tournament matchup. Some of the worst pain I have ever experienced came from a mom in her 40s named Liz who bent my finger backward so hard I thought she broke it.</p>\n<p>In my experience, I have found that men are often hesitant to exert their full force on a very small pre-teen. Almost every woman I have ever fought has seemingly shared the subconscious consensus that while we don’t enjoy beating each other up, it is for our ultimate benefit and betterment as fighters.</p>\n<p>The necessity of taking self-defense classes became more glaringly obvious as I got older, and the emphasis on gender in the dojo became very apparent. The boys who did karate did it because they were hyperactive kids and they needed to learn discipline, or they wanted to learn to fight with swords and nunchucks. But for the very small female population — regardless of age — it was always about having the ability to defend ourselves should we ever be in a situation where it was necessary. From the age of 12 onwards, my sensei made a very big point of reminding me of all of the possibilities of violence against women that lurked beyond the walls of the dojo.</p>\n<p>The constant emphasis on violence against women, while it was important to recognize, became overkill in my mind. I was fed a narrative that made me believe that every stranger was out to cause me harm, and the message transitioned from one of caution to one of causation: “If you do x, y, z, all of these horrible things could happen to you!”</p>\n<p>Going to karate became a chore because if I didn’t learn to defend myself as adequately as I could, whatever could happen to me would feel like my fault, rather than the fault of someone potentially looking to cause me harm. While the environment of the dojo was conducive to physical strength and agility, it also conditioned a chronic pessimism and cynicism.</p>\n<p>When I earned my black belt at age 14, I became the first girl under 18 and the third woman in the history of my studio to achieve that feat. And while I may not be able to break a board with my bare hands or knock a man unconscious with a single punch, I put in just as much work, if not more, than any man.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that I stopped doing karate, it is an enormous part of my identity for better and for worse. Even though there are no female Grandmasters as of right now, they are coming. It may not be me, but the next generation of girls who infiltrated the boy’s club is growing up and they are kicking ass.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Moreno de Alboran displayed his poise, winning that last set by a score of 6-4 and clinching a spot in the next round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno de Alboran’s accomplishment cannot be understated– he is now the first Gaucho to win a singles match in the NCAA tournament since 1995. It is also just the fifth overall win at this tournament in school history for the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Moreno de Alboran will face an uphill battle against the top-ranked singles tennis player in the country: UCLA Senior Martin Redlicki. Redlicki finished the season with video game-esque numbers, going 16-4 at the one spot despite playing in the highly competitive pac-12 conference. Between dual and tour play, Redlicki has gone 20-5 against ranked opponents this season– one of the best marks in the entire country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Redlicki struggled a bit on wednesday, dropping the first set against No.33  Tim Sandkaulen before coming back to win the last two sets, including the last set by a score of 6-1. If Moreno de Alboran came jump out of the gate quickly and utilize his forehand and serve, he could pull off the surprise of the tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Moreno de Alboran has already earned many individual accolades this season, a victory would grant him All-American status– a status that a Gaucho has not earned since 1989, when Kip Brady won three matches to make it to the quarterfinals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno de Alboran will take on Redlicki at 10:30 at the Wake Forest Tennis Complex on Thursday morning.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
