A loss will send the Gauchos back home, but with a win they will face a second opponent later in the day.</p>\n<p>Coming off its first action of the season two weeks ago when it hosted the UCSB Winter Invite, Santa Barbara is looking to get on track after a rough 2-5 start.</p>\n<p>However, despite the disappointing record, the team knows that its play thus far is not representative of how good it can be. With a roster stacked with young freshmen and sophomores, and each of their five losses coming against other top ranked teams, the Gauchos are not too worried about where they are right now.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I think we’re doing really well; we’re all gelling together and we’re working really well as a team,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “The games two weeks ago were really rough, but even though we didn’t win those games we still did pretty well as a team for that being our first time playing together. We have room for improvement and it’s just the beginning.”</p>\n<p>Already at 0-5 against top-20 teams, UCSB will look to end this streak with a win over LMU. The Lions are off to an impressive 3-1 start, already having picked up a 12-7 win over No. 8 San Jose State in the UCLA Invite two weeks ago. Their only loss came against the No. 3 ranked Bruins with a final score of 15-6.</p>\n<p>LMU possesses one of the most powerful offensive machines in the country, already averaging an impressive mark of nearly 16 goals per game in wins. Senior attacker Alexandra Honny is averaging a team high 2.75 goals per game, while four of her teammates are averaging 1.75 or more per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re not really doing anything specific just because we’re playing LMU; we’re just going to play our game and see what we can do,” Martin said. “We’re working on our 6-on-5 as well as our 5-on-6 defense, and making sure that everything is flowing together.”</p>\n<p>Early in the season, the young Gaucho squad has been led by Martin, who has 11 goals through seven games. Just behind her on the stat sheet are freshman attacker Carly Christian with seven goals and last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year in sophomore utility Samantha Murphy with five.</p>\n<p>“Because everyone is so young we’re just all so close and I actually think it’s a good thing because there’s so much room for improvement,” Martin said. “I think the juniors and seniors are really good leaders and can show the way for these [younger players].”</p>\n<p>In seven games this season, UCSB has managed to score an average of seven goals per game, a number the Gauchos will likely need to surpass in order to come away with a win this weekend. In order for them to do so, one of the keys will be how well they can communicate out in the water.</p>\n<p>“We just need to make sure we’re talking as a team and I think that’s something we lacked two weeks ago,” Martin said. “We’ve been working a lot in practice on our communication.”</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on LMU at 12:30 p.m. this Saturday at Canyonview Aquatic Center.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/","id":5084,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5083,5082,5081],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Struggling Gauchos Host Hawaii Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-070.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-070.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB tries to rebound from a three-game losing streak","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Losing seven of its last eight games, the UCSB women’s basketball team is ready to start anew and begin the second round of Big West play.

Even on the offensive side, that helped us because we were able to play a little more physical. I’ll be interested to see if we can play two small guards at the same time with [Onome and Nicole.]”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine essentially play four power forwards and a point guard, so while they don’t have incredible height like the Gauchos have seen in the past, they are a bigger team overall and play an extremely physical game.</p>\n<p>“They’re physical, so it’s not just going to be a test on the basketball side of it, but it’s a physical test and a mental test because they beat you up,” Mitchell said. “We will have to be ready to play blue-collar basketball.”</p>\n<p>The biggest target for Hawaii on offense will be senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who is a force down low despite the fact that she stands at just 5’11’’. She ranks sixth in the Big West in points at 15.8 per game, third in field goal percentage at 51.7 percent and third in rebounding, grabbing 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“She’s a beast. We’ve talked about getting in front of her because if she catches it, you’re done,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware said. “We have to box her out, so we’re going to try to contain her on that end of scoring and boxing her out because she gets a lot of their rebounds. She’s averaging a double-double.”</p>\n<p>Jackson will address the Gauchos’ biggest weakness because all season long, Santa Barbara has struggled with consistency, especially on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>In its last two games against UC Irvine and UC Davis, UCSB has played well in the first half and remained in contention at halftime, but then fallen apart in the second half, falling prey to defensive breakdowns. Against the Aggies, the Gauchos gave up a fatal 47 points in the second, compared to 35 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“Both games were close at one point and we let them get away from us,” Watkins said. “I think the biggest lesson we learned is that we have to put two halves together.”</p>\n<p>One of those defensive breakdowns has been failing to rebound in critical moments. Rebounding makes all the difference for Santa Barbara, which averages 40.7 boards per game in victories and 31 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be physical,” Watkins said. “We haven’t rebounded as well as coach would’ve liked this season so far, but we’re looking to turn our season around and it starts with rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Although the focus won’t be on offense tonight as UCSB hasn’t struggled nearly as much on that end of the floor, Hawaii is a great defensive team. The Rainbow Wahine top the conference in scoring defense, holding teams to 65.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for our kids’ mindsets is that they play majority man defense,” Mitchell said. “They can take a lot of switches because they’re basically all the same size, so we just have to make the right reads out of that. We have to trust and make the extra pass.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/struggling-gauchos-host-hawaii-tonight/","id":563,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[562,561,560],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Battle of the Beach Schools","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"First Place UCSB Travels to Hawaii to Take on the Rainbow Warriors","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Road trips are always a time for team bonding and as the UCSB men’s basketball team embarks on its longest road trip of the season this week, the Gauchos must attempt to balance the strains of travel and the lure of a new place when they face Hawaii tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the contest tied for first place in the Big West with a 14-6 overall record and 5-2 record in conference play.

The victories propelled UCSB back into first place after a weekend, which saw them fall to Cal State Fullerton and narrowly escape UC Riverside in overtime.</p>\n<p>“After the loss to Fullerton it was kind of another wake up for us to realize that if we don’t come ready to play each night, teams that may not have the best record can easily come out here and beat us,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos with a pair of monster performances last weekend was junior center Alan Williams. The big man garnered his fourth Big West Player of the Week Award this season after he averaged 26.5 points, 15 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks in the two victories.</p>\n<p>Also of importance was the emotional return of sophomore guard John Green on Saturday against Davis. Green played in his first regular season game as a Gaucho after injuries derailed his collegiate career over the past three years. It will certainly be of interest to see how Green progresses and emerges into Santa Barbara’s rotation of wing players including Boswell, sophomore guard Michael Bryson and sophomore forward Taran Brown.</p>\n<p>With a return to health for the majority of its lineup and riding two important conference victories, the Gauchos are certainly poised to continue their run as a contender in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was nice to come out last week and get two solid wins,” Boswell said. “It definitely gives us momentum, and we feel like we can compete with any team in the conference and that we’re the best team in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s matchup will certainly challenge the Gauchos, however, as the Rainbow Warriors are victorious in four of their past five games. Hawaii boasts an impressive 11-3 home record and leads the conference in scoring with over 82 points per game, over eight points better than the second ranked team.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be a tough game. They got some solid wins in the preseason and they have a lot of talent on their team,” Boswell said. “They’ve got some guards that are really quick and can push the tempo and they’ve also got some big guys that are a force to be reckoned with down low. We’ve just got to come out with a lot of energy like we have the last few games and play hard and let the game come to us.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Christian Standhardinger leads Hawaii in points (17.6) and rebounds (7.6) per game, ranking third and fifth in the conference, respectively. The Rainbow Warriors also tout sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year. Fotu ranks in the top 10 of the conference in both points and rebounds. Junior guard Garrett Nevels also places in the top 10 in Big West scoring, giving the Rainbow Warriors three top scorers.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be really difficult; Standhardinger is an awesome player. He gets to the foul line and is one of the best in our league,” Boswell said. “He’s a force in terms of driving to the basket and creating contact. You can’t completely eliminate a factor like him but if we can keep him contained, and make him work for his points and don’t give him second chance opportunities … I think we’ll have a pretty good shot at taking down the Warriors.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 7 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53891\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53891\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/","id":570,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[569,568,567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts LMU, Arizona this Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10.11.2013-UCSB-Mens-Tennis-Peter-Vandenbelt-21.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10.11.2013-UCSB-Mens-Tennis-Peter-Vandenbelt-21.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos try to improve their 1-2 record at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be Winter Quarter here at UCSB but the men’s tennis team looks forward to playing in the sun this weekend with matches against LMU and Arizona.

According to coach Marty Davis, “We’ve been practicing a lot on our service games. In order to win these matches we need to be able to hold our serves better.”</p>\n<p>Davis also expects his team’s fitness to help his team this weekend. The Gauchos are experienced and strong enough to be able to play matches on consecutive days without worry. With two weeks of practice under their belts since their last match, the Gauchos will be energized and ready for their next matches.</p>\n<p>Looking at their opponents, the Gauchos will be taking on a strong LMU team that is 2-0 this season with wins over Sacramento State and UC Davis. Top players are sophomore David Doehring, sophomore Cristobal Rivera and the top doubles team will be junior Todd Volmari and senior Sebastian Bustamante. Expect new Coach Tom Lloyd’s team to come up to Santa Barbara ready for some close and competitive matches.</p>\n<p>Then on Sunday the Gauchos welcome Arizona, a Pac-12 team that Davis expects to be ranked by the end of the season. Arizona is 5-5 this season and plays Cal Poly Friday afternoon. They have also beaten UC Irvine twice, a team the Gauchos hope to contend with for the Big West Title. Standout players the Gauchos need to be ready for are sophomore Naoki Takeda who has won his last four singles matches, along with senior Fredrik Ask and freshman Will Kneale. The Gauchos hope to use their home court advantage to come out of the weekend victorious.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a tough team to beat at home the last few years and we plan on continuing that,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope to get large fan support this weekend as the players feel they always play better in front of a crowd. Junior Ziad Sultan and senior Sasha Gryznov will be counted on to give hard-fought performances as the top doubles team and Sultan as the top singles player. These two players will be keys to the team’s success in the matches this weekend.</p>\n<p>“College tennis is similar to the Davis Cup,” Davis said. “Loud fans are encouraged, and I hope to see them out at the courts this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on LMU Saturday at 1 p.m. and Arizona at noon on Sunday. Both matches will be played on the tennis courts directly behind the Recreational Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53886\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-hosts-lmu-arizona-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53886\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-hosts-lmu-arizona-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-hosts-lmu-arizona-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-hosts-lmu-arizona-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-hosts-lmu-arizona-this-weekend/","id":213,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[212,211,210],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel North for Pair of Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara set for Washington State and University of Washington","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off its first win in last weekend’s road trip against Loyola Marymount University, the UCSB women’s tennis team looks to face a dynamic weekend duo of opponents in Washington State and the University of Washington, both of which will be away games.</p>\n<p>In last week’s statement win over LMU, the Gauchos displayed enduring offensive skills winning in a 4-3 shootout.

Our energy will have to remain high for the entire time and each of us will have to be willing to step up and take chances when the opportunities present themselves.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then head to Seattle where they will face the No. 41 ranked University of Washington (3-1). In Washington’s last match they faced Minnesota, outlasting the visiting team 4-3. Washington has had a commanding season thus far, impressively defeating UNLV 4-3 and Long Beach State 5-2; their only loss came to No. 8 ranked California. Washington will be one of the tougher opponents that the Gauchos have faced this season.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited for this weekend because it will be a great experience flying out of state together to compete,” Scatliffe said. “We will also be playing our matches indoors for the first time. We are very prepared considering we played some great tennis last weekend in Los Angeles and San Diego and have been training hard.”</p>\n<p>This weekend will be a great test for the Gauchos, who are still in the process of restructuring their lineup in order to give them their best chance of winning. The Gauchos will be without senior Kiersten Meehan for the second consecutive weekend due to an injury that Meehan suffered earlier in the season. Meehan has been an important aspect for the team and started at first singles in the home opener against San Francisco on Jan. 26.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also be playing two matches in the course of 24 hours, but will have to travel from Washington State in Pullman to University of Washington in Seattle. This is a distance of nearly 300 miles. UCSB clearly has a difficult task ahead of them, and will look to upset two dominant teams this weekend in the Evergreen State.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match against Washington State is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., while Sunday’s match is scheduled for a 10 a.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53884\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53884\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/","id":209,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[208,207,206],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens its Season This Weekend at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos face Dayton in their first game of the 2014 season","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team looks to kick off its season at home this weekend with the 2014 Gaucho Classic.</p>\n<p>Four different teams will be competing in the round-robin tournament including Cal State Bakersfield, Dayton and Texas A&amp;M.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who had an overall record of 31-24 and a conference record of 12-12 last year, will play in four games at Campus Diamond including a double header on Friday.

As a freshman, Palomares was a huge offensive surge as she reeled in 50 hits and had an average of .307 overall, ranking her second on the team behind Soria.</p>\n<p>The presence of Palomares last year beautifully complemented the “small-ball” style of play that the Gauchos present by getting on base and creating scoring opportunities for the team.</p>\n<p>Another player who is sure to make some noise for Santa Barbara this weekend is junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom. Wisdom, a former Big West Freshman of the year and All Big West team selection, is a double-sided knife for the Gauchos on the diamond with outstanding defense and offense.</p>\n<p>Last year she stood in the circle almost twice as much as any other pitcher with 43 appearances, 27 of them being starts. She pitched a total of 193.1 innings, while no other pitchers reached 100 innings on the year, and recorded an earned run average of 3.19, 136 strikeouts and 17 wins.</p>\n<p>Her defense in the circle is dominating but it is not limited to pitching, as the coaching staff is no stranger to sticking the junior in the outfield on days that she doesn’t pitch or even after they bring in another pitcher. This strategy used by head coach Brie Galicinao is without a doubt to keep her on the field for offense.</p>\n<p>Last year Wisdom ranked third on the team in batting average with .299 and first in RBI’s as she drove in 41 for UCSB. Her ability to get big hits (.545 SLG%, 8 HR’s) provides a surge for the Gauchos that allows the team to take control of games early and for her to close out the match with her arms. Anytime a player can superbly provide their own run support, they will surely be a threat to any team. Her Babe-Ruth-like style has made her very valuable to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Being that this is the opening of the season for the Gauchos, look to see an appearance from some of the new additions of the team. In the off-season UCSB picked up six freshman, three outfielders, two infielders and a pitcher. With some proficient and disciplined play by the Gauchos this weekend, these younger players will get a chance to put their cleats on NCAA grass for the first time.</p>\n<p>First pitch will be thrown at 10 a.m. Friday morning against Dayton at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Then, at five years old, she made her first basket all by herself and instantly knew basketball was the right path for her.</p>\n<p>“My brother used to always say, ‘Look at the front of the rim and just shoot it.’ I did it one time and it went in and I was so excited,” Mason said. “I ran in and told my dad, ‘I made it! I made it!’ Right there, I was like ‘I want to do this.’”</p>\n<p>Just like that, Mason was enthralled with the game of basketball.</p>\n<p>“I was outside all the time … all the time,” Mason said. “Every chance I could get, I was playing with guys and playing with people older than me.”</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to college, where Mason is playing for the UCSB women’s basketball team. The passionate little kid who grew up wanting to play professionally is still inside her and evident to all around her.</p>\n<p>“She’s the first one in the gym most of the time and the last one out of here, always grabbing the freshmen to spend extra time with them on their skills,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “She’s just a basketball junkie. That’s the fun part of it — she eats, breathes, lives and is passionate about the game.”</p>\n<p>Now in her senior year, Mason is experiencing a breakout season. While not known for her offense in previous years, Mason is one of the three seniors anchoring the Gaucho attack this year, which has seen tremendous improvement from previous seasons. The senior guard ranks third on the team in scoring at 12.8 points per game, shooting an impressive 42.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“Destini on the court is not too different than Destini off the court — just very, very high energy,” teammate Nicole Nesbit said. “She’s a very passionate player. She’s very into the game. You can see it all over her face when she plays.”</p>\n<p>Entering this season, Mason’s career-high was 13 points. That total has been shattered on four separate occasions, the most recent coming during UCSB’s first Big West game of the year at rival Cal Poly where Mason totaled 24 points. She also broke her career-high in field goals made as she went 10-17 from the field.</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly game foreshadowed good things to come during conference play for Mason. Despite the team’s struggle, Mason has continued to improve during Big West play.</p>\n<p>Mason increased her field goal percentage to 46.9 percent and has elevated her game from long range, knocking down six three-pointers, which is just one shy of her total from nonconference play. She’s also upped her percentage from behind the arc from 31.8 percent to 35.3 percent.</p>\n<p>“Destini is a very talented player and I think she’s definitely starting to come into her own and feel confident, especially on the offensive end,” Nesbit said. “She is very good in transition; she’s a good attacker. She has good size and can usually post up smaller guards. She has a very nice mid-range jumper. She can shoot the three as well, but doesn’t as often. She’s a complete offensive player and I think she’s starting to believe that.”</p>\n<p>However, Mason is much more than a scorer. It may not show up in the box scores, but since her arrival to Santa Barbara, Mason has served as the defensive stopper for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think I just have a niche for defense,” Mason said. “Defense is just really about heart, which I have, and not wanting to get scored on, which I have, and (then some) positioning, technique and strength.”</p>\n<p>Yet, possibly the biggest asset Mason has given to the Gauchos this season is her versatility. With an undersized roster, Mitchell has often moved the 5’8’’ Mason to the power forward position, although Mason has been known to play positions one through four all season long.</p>\n<p>“I like watching the game and I think that’s why, being a four player this year, it came kind of easy because I watch it so much,” Mason said. “It just came natural because I knew their positioning and what they were looking for.”</p>\n<p>The transition has actually aided Mason who, as a guard, leads the team in rebounding with 6.0 boards per game. She also averages 0.9 steals and 0.5 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“Just having so many players (from Rutgers) that are in the [WNBA], I tell her that she has to be great at everything,” Mitchell said. “You can’t just do one thing well to be a WNBA player, so I just challenge her every day to be a complete player and not just one-dimensional and I think her versatility will give her a look.”</p>\n<p>Altogether, Mason seems to be making the strongest case she can to the WNBA. Add all of Mason’s accomplishments together along with the fact that she serves as the team’s vocal leader this season and Mason easily makes a case for the most improved player under Mitchell’s reign.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of those that it’s the reason you coach, and you smile because I can remember walking into this gym for my first skill workouts and I saw her sitting in the corner, but at that point she had asked for her release and was transferring from UCSB,” Mitchell said. “That’s what you want from young women is for them to mature and grow and be independent and confident in who they are as an individual and as a basketball player. So, you have to smile for her now being out there confident, the jokester and the ultimate leader.”</p>\n<p>If looking closely, Mason’s game actually resembles one of the great players to play in the WNBA and one of her role models: Deanna Nolan, the three-time WNBA champion and 2006 Finals MVP. Both are long guards that have incredible athleticism and while not the flashiest players, make a substantial mark on every game.</p>\n<p>“[Nolan] would jump out of the gym. The elevation on her jumper was ungodly,” Mitchell said. “She also played with that little cocky edge, which I’m okay with, and I think all the great players have somewhat. Some people could misread it, but to me it shows she’s passionate; she plays with a level of excitement that you don’t take that away from players.”</p>\n<p>But as a student of the game, Nolan isn’t the only player that can be seen in Mason’s game. When looking closely, you might see pieces of a pair of L.A. Laker guards.</p>\n<p>“I copied a lot of people, but that’s okay because that’s how you get better,” Mason said. “I take bits and pieces of a lot of different players, so [Nolan] definitely with the way she flows with the offense with the ball. Also, Kobe; I like his fadeaway, so I do his fadeaway and Nick Young, just the way he gets excited about every shot.”</p>\n<p>While earning a spot in the WNBA is extremely difficult with the limited number of teams and roster spots, Mitchell believes Mason’s ability to be an all-around player makes her dream a possible reality.</p>\n<p>“I think she’ll definitely get the looks, in whether she gets training camps or invites to any of the combines,” Mitchell said. “Never give up on your dreams if that’s her dream and we’ll help her keep working hard and hopefully she’ll have a chance at some point.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/","id":562,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[561,560,559],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl XLVIII: One Game,  Plenty of New Legacies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Peyton Manning Still a Remarkable QB","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The clock ran down to zero, the Gatorade was dumped on the coach and the confetti began falling, bringing an end to another football season.

But in this league, and in sports in general, a player’s greatness is evaluated by how many rings he has.</p>\n<p>However, what separates Manning from the rest is that he didn’t need to win to solidify his legacy. Countless broken records and one Super Bowl title is already enough for Manning to claim his place among the greatest who ever played the game.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself this, would you place Eli Manning, who has two Super Bowl titles, ahead of big brother Peyton?</p>\n<p>Although the Broncos might have lost in a humiliating fashion that no one saw coming, how much can that actually change what Manning has accomplished over his career? Not much. He has achieved what no other quarterback has done during his era has, and that is something worth noting in a pass-happy league.</p>\n<p>The knock on Manning will remain that he is the greatest regular season quarterback ever. But think about it, how many players can lead a team to the best record for two-straight years after coming off a career-threatening neck injury? That alone should give you some insight into Manning’s greatness, and he did it at 37 years of age.</p>\n<p>Looking back at the game, it wasn’t all Manning’s fault. It’s easy to point fingers at only the quarterback and the coach in football. Yet, a quarterback is only as good as the supporting cast around him, and that supporting cast that showed up for the first 18 games of the season was nowhere to be found in the last game of the year.</p>\n<p>No one could have predicted that the first play of the game would result in a botched snap going over the head of Manning and turning into a safety. Manning sure didn’t.</p>\n<p>The explosive wide receiver core of Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker trembled and looked flustered by the Legion of Boom, and the offensive line did little to help Manning throw his signature passes.</p>\n<p>The Broncos defense wasn’t much help either. Seattle hadn’t been putting up points in its run-up to the Super Bowl, yet the Broncos’ defense gave up two touchdowns through the air, one on the ground, one on a kick return and had a bunch of missed tackles.</p>\n<p>The Broncos were outplayed by a defense that was built to counter its record-setting offense. It’s as simple as that. The better team won and it showed throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this wasn’t the storybook ending Peyton Manning and fans had hoped for. Numerous people dreamed of Peyton going out on top just like John Elway did after he lost his first three Super Bowls for Denver.</p>\n<p>The Broncos are still a young, talented team with much to improve on and under the leadership of Elway, the Broncos will still be a contender. For Peyton, at least he knows there’s someone in the organization who knows how he feels right about now and will give him the tools to get back.</p>\n<p>So, is Peyton one of the greatest to play? Yes. Is he the greatest of all-time? Not right now, but there’s always next season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53867\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53867\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/","id":2059,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2058,2057,2056],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl XLVIII: One Game,  Plenty of New Legacies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Pete Carroll is the Best Coach in the West","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Pete Carroll isn’t just in the championship business.

Before he went to Southern California, Carroll had unsuccessful tenures with the New York Jets and New England Patriots. A late season slide resulted in a 6-10 record with the Jets in 1994, leading to his firing after one season.</p>\n<p>Because of his success as a defensive backs coach and a defensive coordinator, he was given the chance to follow Bill Parcells in New England. The Patriots made the playoffs in Carroll’s first two seasons, but Carroll was again fired after a late season slide in 1999.</p>\n<p>Carroll had gained a reputation as a lame duck NFL head coach, but created a new legacy as an all-world recruiter and young spirit with his time at USC. He is the epitome of a player’s coach, and it translated to success in the NFL with this young Seahawks team. It’s not every day where a 62-year-old head coach connects with his players as equals, participating in full-contact drills one day and leading meditative yoga sessions the next.</p>\n<p>Carroll encourages his players to be themselves, on-and-off the field, which is part of the reason the attitude and sometimes overzealous confidence of the Legion of Boom is tolerated by fans in Seattle. Also, a Super Bowl ring helps.</p>\n<p>After becoming only the third coach in history to win a Super Bowl and a National Championship, Pete Carroll has established himself as one of the all-time greats, not just in college football. He is far and away the best football coach in the western United States (all due respect to Jim Harbaugh, but Pete has the hardware), and deserves to be included with names like Bill Belichick and Nick Saban in the conversation of best coach in America.</p>\n<p>There is also the strong possibility that we might be witnessing the next NFL dynasty evolving before our very eyes. Seattle has a 25-year-old franchise quarterback who has had more winning success in his first two years than any player in history, lethal weapons on offense in Marshawn Lynch and Percy Harvin, the best secondary in the last 20 years with all three of their all-world players returning, salary cap flexibility once they get rid of some overpriced inessential players and the best home-field advantage outside of Kansas City.</p>\n<p>A winning culture has been restored in Seattle, and Pete Carroll is leading the way. He was voted most popular coach in the league by players, and with his emphasis on relentless competition, no matter the situation, the loaded NFC can count on the road to the Super Bowl going through the 12th man.</p>\n<p>One would think Carroll has earned some rest and relaxation after such an epic journey. He’s having none of that though. The Seahawks victory parade is scheduled for Wednesday. Meetings to begin the 2014 season occurred yesterday. A champion’s work is never done. Always compete.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/","id":2058,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2057,2056,2055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Surge to First Place After Pair of Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.1.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCD-4_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.1.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCD-4_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB came up big with home victories against UC Irvine and UC Davis this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There were a number of prominent storylines this weekend for the UCSB men’s basketball team, ranging from a pair of decisive victories to junior center Alan Williams’ usual dominance down low.

Big Al also finished the game with four assists and two blocked shots.</p>\n<p>“We go to him every game to see who can stop him because I don’t think anyone in division I basketball can stop him,” freshman point guard Eric Childress said.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 15 points on 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc, becoming only the third Gaucho to make 200 career three-pointers in the process.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 11 points for UCSB, while Childress added eight points and three assists. This game was never in question as the Gauchos outrebounded Davis by a margin of 14 and outshot the Aggies in both field goal and three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that we can run this conference and really be the number one team to win that Big West Championship,” Green said. “Once we have the opportunity to meet these two teams that we lost to [we’re confident] that we’re going to handle business.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest against UC Irvine began the weekend on a high note for the Gauchos, as they stomped the Anteaters in an 80-60 victory. Big Al led UCSB with 26 points and 10 rebounds despite having to go against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye who is all of 7’6” and 290 pounds.</p>\n<p>“We really came out very intense, excited to play and we definitely showed some stuff tonight,” Big Al said. “We showed our heart, we showed our aggressiveness and we showed our competitive edge out there. When we have that competitive edge and we play as hard as we did tonight we’re a tough team to beat.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taran Brown finished the game with 16 points and shot a perfect 5-5 from the three. Boswell scored 10 points off the bench, sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added eight points and six rebounds and junior point guard Zalmico Harmon contributed seven points and six assists.</p>\n<p>Following a Saturday victory at Cal Poly, Irvine now stands tied with UCSB for first with a 5-2 Big West record (14-9 overall).</p>\n<p>“We have guys that have really accepted their roles on this team and I think that we’re finally starting to see how good we can possibly be,” Big Al said. “Of course we have a lot of work to do, but when we all accept our roles and play our roles we’re a tough team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays Thursday at Hawai’i.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53834\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53834\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/","id":558,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[557,556,555],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB picked up its first win of the season over the weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team split two away games this weekend while also gathering its first win on the season, beating LMU in a 4-3 thriller on Saturday and then falling to the University of San Diego 3-4 on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos (1-3) first headed to Loyola Marymount University (1-3) where they played an enticing match and defeated LMU 4-3. This was a big win for the Gauchos, as they have now beaten the team three years in a row. The Gauchos won in a shootout, and this was clearly the theme of Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>Number one singles starter April Scatliffe had a substantial win over LMU’s Miya Jin 6-3, 4-6, 10-6. In second singles, Stacey Yam fell to LMU’s Jessica Perez 3-6, 2-6, and at three singles Paola Cos was beaten by LMU’s Kristine Kouyoumjian 1-6, 2-6. Melissa Baker, a new addition to the Gauchos, had a huge win at fourth singles, defeating Lauri Mueller 4-6, 6-1, 10-8. Priscila Garcia at fifth doubles dropped her match to LMU’s Reka Rohonyi 6-4, 1-6, 11-13. At sixth singles Luisa Ortiz Candido defeated LMU’s Julia Norlin 7-5, 6-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I think we played well and fought extremely hard today,” Scatliffe said. “Winning at LMU was a great booster for us because we went on this trip missing our number two and three players, so we were already at a deficit from the start, but ended up playing great tennis.”</p>\n<p>The game came down to the doubles matches for the Gauchos where the duos of Scatliffe/Garcia and Yam/Ortiz Candido came out with huge wins for the Gauchos to lift them to an overall victory of 4-3. With the victory, the Gauchos obtained their first win on the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB (1-3) continued their road trip heading to San Diego (1-2) on Sunday where another close battle was displayed by both teams.</p>\n<p>Scatliffe started again at first singles for the Gauchos, falling to SD’s Shani Blecher 4-6, 3-6. The Gauchos saw victories at their number five singles starter Garcia, who defeated SD’s Mikayla Morkel-Brink 6-0, 6-2 and at number six singles where Ortiz Candido beat SD’s Idil Haciraifoglu 6-3, 2-6, 1-0. However, these victories were not enough as the Gauchos were outlasted by San Diego 3-4.</p>\n<p>“San Diego was a ranked team and the fact that we won all of our doubles matches and we were only one match away from winning shows how tough we are,” Scatliffe said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still weeks away from conference play and therefore have plenty of time to get healthy and devise a supreme lineup. UCSB looks to face Washington St. followed by Washington in another road trip next weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53831\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53831\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches-2/","id":210,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[209,208,207],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Third Straight at Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-072.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-072.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is struggling as the Gauchos fell to eighth place in the conference standings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>During Big West play, there has been one dominant storyline for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ downfall is inconsistent play.

The Aggies move into a three-way tie for third place, improving to 9-11 overall and 4-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With a struggling team, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell changed the starting lineup, benching two of her three seniors and instead starting three freshmen, a sophomore and Zornig. The move worked as the Gauchos jumped out to an early 20-9 lead.</p>\n<p>“We just had to mix it up and I was going with effort,” Mitchell said. “It’s obvious what we’ve been doing so far hasn’t worked and we just wanted energy to start the game.”</p>\n<p>However, Davis responded, picking up its defensive intensity by switching into its trapping defense and offensively taking advantage of its size down low. The Aggies stormed back to take a one-point lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Opening up the second half, Santa Barbara came out flat once again. Three-point shots sparked a 7-0 fun for Davis, giving the Aggies a comfortable lead. In the second half, UCD shot 41.7 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have a lot of weapons on their team,” Zornig said. “They have good post players inside and then a lot of them can knock down the three. That’s their game and we knew that.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the second half, UCSB found ways to cut the lead to five or six points several times, but could never come up with the defensive stop needed to get within one possession.</p>\n<p>“At that point, it’s more mental than anything. You can’t trade baskets, especially when you’re down,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “There were a couple times where we would get a stop, we’d go down and score and then miss a box out or something like that. I know we had a couple of key mental mistakes in the second half and things like that cost you games.”</p>\n<p>The biggest discrepancy came at the free throw line. The Aggies, the best free throw shooting team in the Big West, shot 31-36 from the charity stripe while the Gauchos did not stand up to their second place ranking in conference, shooting just 18-29 from the line.</p>\n<p>“I’m not even going to spend the effort talking about their 36 attempts. It was our lack of knocking down the 29 attempts we had,” Mitchell said. “If you’re going to get that many attempts on the road, you have to focus. You win on the road by making layups, not turning the ball over and getting to the free throw line. We got there; we just didn’t knock them down.”</p>\n<p>Davis’ leading scorer, junior forward Sydnee Fipps, scored 21 points for Davis, but it was sophomore forward Alyson Doherty that killed UCSB and exploited its lack of height down low. Although averaging 11.7 points per game, Doherty exploded for a game-high 23 points on 7-11 shooting, including 9-12 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Nesbit led the team with 17 points while Zornig added 14 points and a team-high eight rebounds. In addition, in her first start in conference play, freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright finished the afternoon with nine points and seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Mi’Chael’s that blue-collar kid that is going to go after every rebound and that’s why we recruited her,” Mitchell said. “She stepped up tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home next week to take on Hawaii and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53824\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53824\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/","id":557,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[556,555,554],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Hawai’i Twice at Rob Gym","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB came away from this weekend with two important and impressive victories over Hawai'i.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 9 UCSB men’s volleyball team picked up a pair of wins against No. 11 Hawai’i in a weekend doubleheader.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos increase their overall record to 5-2, and their conference record to 4-2.

The Gauchos were slow to start and allowed Hawai’i to take the first set, a problem that they have consistently struggled with this season.</p>\n<p>Not daunted by this early lead, UCSB came back strong and showed its offensive dominance in the second and third sets. Licht made his presence known, recording 22 kills, the most of any Gaucho so far this season and one off his own personal best.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about getting in a rhythm and being confident knowing that we were the better team,” Licht said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos took a dramatic lead in the third set, at one point dominating the Rainbow Warriors 13-3. When they fell this far behind, Hawaii’s Head Coach Charlie Wade made a n interesting call and pulled all the starters, allowing them to catch a break before the fourth set. The Gauchos would finish this set with an impressive hitting percentage of .647.</p>\n<p>Despite their performance in the second and third set, the Gauchos encountered a roadblock in the fourth when the rested Hawai’i bench came out fighting. The Rainbow Warriors were victorious, sending the game to five.</p>\n<p>“It was the smartest move that anyone has made in a long time and it worked because they came back in game four and got us,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “We just had to regroup, we knew it was going to be a battle.”</p>\n<p>The fifth set remained relatively close as both teams traded points back and forth. The Gauchos held a 12-11 lead before Hawai’i had two straight attacking errors, putting UCSB at match point. The Rainbow Warriors fought back making it 14-13, but a block by sophomore setter Jonah Seif would end the match at 15-13.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s strong offensive performance was apparent in the numbers, with four different players hitting double digits in kills that night.</p>\n<p>“We adjusted our scouting report a little bit, but we knew that if we just played hard and executed that we were the better team and that over time we were going to win,” Licht said.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, a night earlier, the Gauchos were equally as victorious taking down Hawai’i 3-1. This game was especially important because the Gauchos were able to break the trend of slow starts and get a win in the first set.</p>\n<p>In this match the Gauchos had seven service aces to Hawaii’s zero, and out blocked the Rainbow Warriors 12 to 7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos extended their series win streak over Hawai’i to seven games, and they now hold an impressive 5-1 record at home.</p>\n<p>“A 2-0 week is always awesome. We have two down days to rest up and get ready to go and play USC,” Licht said.</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays USC on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/","id":5265,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5264,5263,5262],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Backed Into a Corner, Need Big West Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-092.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-092.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels to UC Irvine today","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s been a disappointing year for the UCSB women’s basketball team so far.</p>\n<p>Currently 1-4 in the Big West, Santa Barbara has lost on the road and at home.

You coach to win every game. The players play to win, so other than that it’s short-term memory and you get back to work.”</p>\n<p>Holding seventh place in the Big West, the Gauchos will have the opportunity to shake up the conference standings this weekend as Irvine sits just one place above them. The Anteaters are 9-10 overall and 2-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While most of its games have been played on the road, Irvine owns a perfect home record of 4-0.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem throughout conference play for UCSB has been consistency. In the team’s most recent loss to Cal State Fullerton, Santa Barbara played a solid first half, taking a 33-23 lead into halftime. However, the Gauchos broke down defensively in the second half, allowing the Titans 44 points.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a broken record, but we have to continue to do what we usually do, especially with defense,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “At this point in the season, everyone needs to know their role. Nothing has changed from the beginning to the season to now. We have to do what we do and do it well.”</p>\n<p>The only point of reliability for UCSB this season has been its offense. The Gauchos rank third in the conference in field goal percentage, shooting 40.6 percent. Their three senior guards in Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason average double-figures on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>Yet this week, the stress in practice is undoubtedly on defense. Not only has the Santa Barbara defense been uncharacteristically inconsistent this season, holding teams to 62.8 points during wins compared to 73.1 points during losses, but Irvine ranks second in the Big West in scoring with 71.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters may not be the tallest team, but they do have a big post presence inside. Irvine will work its offense around senior forward Camille Buckley, who ranks eighth in the conference in scoring with 15.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll mix it up,” Mitchell said. “We’ll have to be extremely disciplined, like we were the first half against Fullerton, and we’ll have to probably run two different people at Buckley at times looking to double team her because she’s that good.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Buckley isn’t the only offensive threat. Irvine surrounds Buckley with shooters, including senior guard Jennifer Tsurumoto, who ranks first on the team and fifth in the league in scoring with 16.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Any given night, they have Camille Buckley who has the chance to play at the next level. She’s a big time athlete, but they also have shooters,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced. Any given night, they can probably beat anyone in the conference.”</p>\n<p>After playing defense, it will be critical for the Gauchos that they secure the rebound, not only to keep Irvine from earning second chance opportunities, but to jumpstart the offense before Irvine can set its zone defense.</p>\n<p>Led by Buckley, who averages 9.4 rebounds per game, Irvine ranks second in the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 41.8 boards per game. UCSB currently ranks last at 34.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding is huge,” Mason said. “We only got outrebounded by three [against Fullerton], but it’s when we got outrebounded. It was at critical times and they got momentum off of it because they were knocking down threes.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/","id":553,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[552,551,550],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Hosts No. 11 Hawaii in Pair of Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos try to rebound from losses to UCLA and UC Irvine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This weekend’s matchups will be far from a relaxing time at the beach for the UCSB men’s volleyball team.

The match against UCLA was their first road game of the season and it was apparent that the Gauchos were not ready for the change of environment. The game against UCI, which was at home in Rob Gym, exemplified a strong comeback performance by UCSB as Santa Barbara came back from a 0-2 start to lose 3-2.</p>\n<p>“It would be huge for us to get the first win to start with; we are not even going to worry about the second night yet,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “That first night we have to come off our last loss and show that we are ready to play again.”</p>\n<p>In the third set against UCI, the Gauchos rallied for a comeback by making some changes at the service line and at the net. They came out serving the ball aggressively and found their blocking rhythm in the middle. In order to be victorious against Hawaii this week, a similar level of play will need to happen, but this time it needs to be demonstrated early in the game rather than in the third or fourth set. The Gauchos have struggled with slow starts this season, with similar situations occurring in the Stanford, UCLA and UCI games.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s team is well rounded this year, there are specific players that have especially stepped up in the past few games. Junior outside hitter Austin Kingi is one to watch on offense, currently leading the team with 56 kills. Kingi recorded a season high 17 kills in UCSB’s last game against UCI.</p>\n<p>“Austin has been a huge part of our success; he has been the steadiest guy on the entire team night in and night out,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>Another key to UCSB’s success this season has been its strong presence at the service line. Seif leads the team with nine service aces, and Kingi follows close behind with eight of his own.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors will enter today’s match riding the momentum of a three game winning streak, currently sitting at 5-2 overall and 3-1 in conference. They recently beat Long Beach State in five and swept UCSD in a two-game series.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been watching film all week and keying on their tendencies,” Seif said. “We know they are a strong serving team so we have been getting a lot of passing reps in. We know who they like to set and have been doing drills to replicate their offense.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior middle blocker Taylor Averill had a successful series against UCSD for the Rainbow Warriors. Averill had only one hitting error in both games and hit .708 while averaging 3.0 kills and 1.50 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>“The good part about it is the first match for us is Thursday. We have had four days to prepare for one team, which is rare in our league,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is scheduled to play Hawaii today and Friday at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53788\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53788\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/","id":5263,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5262,5261,5260],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":135,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
