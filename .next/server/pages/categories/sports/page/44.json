After a game that was mostly dominated by a Gaucho offense, the Highlander defense proved too stingy to allow any more than several shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, no Gaucho attempts hit the back of the net and all Riverside needed was one in order to shock their opponents; and that they did as their window of opportunity presented itself in the 87<sup>th</sup> minute of play.</p>\n<p>Thus, the men’s soccer season has now come to a conclusion. Besides a foul ridden game and countless rotational substitutions, not much went for either team throughout the entire match.</p>\n<p>The first save of the night came fairly early as Gaucho freshman forward Sahid Conteh landed a sweeping shot that was covered by Highlander goalkeeper Vincent Morales. UCSB’s following shot was even closer than the previous as a well placed header by midfielder Joseph Ammer collided with the post in the 13<sup>th</sup> minute. For the rest of the first half the Gauchos dominated the majority of possession, but without another key opportunity it remained quiet and scoreless.</p>\n<p>Following the second whistle signaling the second half start, a combined 19 substitutions were made during play as both head coaches sought after any switch that may tip the balance of the game in their favor. Soon after, it was Sanchez’ score that sent UCSB’s ‘Soccer Heaven’ into a state of shock as the Gauchos fell victim to an early round exit.</p>\n<p>Harder Stadium was gloomy as the game-winning goal took the breath out of everyone and the final whistle sounded. Exhausted Gaucho players fell on top of the pitch as the Highlanders celebrated their biggest upset of the year.</p>\n<p>The severity of the loss was evident as Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg spoke to his team on the field rather than in the locker room.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a trying and challenging season with lots of issues, going all the way back to Kevin [Feucht] getting hurt … so we’ve been playing catch up all year,” he said. “We went the first six games scoring three goals, the first three games scoring no goals, and ironically we ended the season just how we started it.”</p>\n<p>The coach’s words rang true as the Gauchos lack of offense decided not only the result of the postseason match, but several others throughout the year. Regardless of controlling the rhythm of games and minimizing opponents’ time of possession, the Gauchos just seemed to be missing that playmaking ability in the final third of their season.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we were getting close but frankly I got nothing from my bench tonight. No one came off the bench tonight and helped us, and that was my biggest disappointment,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ head coach would then go on and mention the importance of finding some bench production within their current 27-man roster. Altogether, hopes still remain high for this young and very talented UCSB roster.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the offseason, the team will work on adding the playmakers required in order to add to their future season’s total goal tally. For now, the Gauchos must put this loss behind them and focus on developing their star underclassmen as they shape the future of the UCSB men’s soccer program.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Santa Barbara is only one of four teams that have even taken a set from the Mustangs in that span.</p>\n<p>If it is going to upset the Mustangs, UCSB will need a much more consistent and well-balanced attack than what it had last time.</p>\n<p>After that sparkling first set, the Gauchos hit -.057 and .000 in the following two, which will never be sufficient against any team, let alone a powerhouse like Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We were able to keep Cal Poly below their attack average for the match,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “That will be one key. We also need to attack at a much higher clip.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, as usual, was a one-woman wrecking ball against Cal Poly, and the Gauchos will likely need something similar to a repeat of her 21 kills, eight digs and five blocks in the rematch.</p>\n<p>Since that match, the redshirt sophomore outside hitter has been on fire, averaging 24 kills per match along with 12.75 digs per game, earning some Big West and National Awards along the way.</p>\n<p>However, Ruddins isn’t the player Santa Barbara needs to worry about.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Gauchos will need high performances from other young guns to keep up the firepower.</p>\n<p>“We had three players that didn’t really produce offensively last time,” Lantagne Welch said. “If we can get at least two more going to have four producing, that will be important.”</p>\n<p>More specifically, Welch is looking for sophomore outside hitter Chloe Allen, sophomore middle blocker Charlie Robinson and freshmen middle blockers Kija Rivers and Nicole Omwanghe to step up and produce against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Adding that attack depth would do wonders against the stout Mustang defense, but it hasn’t quite clicked for the Gauchos so far this year.</p>\n<p>Allen is coming off a 13-kill performance against Hawaii and seems fully recovered from a midseason injury.</p>\n<p>Robinson and Omwanghe have shown flashes throughout the season, with Robinson’s 129 kills placing her second on the team, but they have yet to sustain their success for an extended period.</p>\n<p>All that attacking, however, won’t do much if the Gauchos can’t contain the Cal Poly attack, led by Adlee and Torrey Van Winden.</p>\n<p>The sisters smashed through the UCSB defense back in early October, combining for 39 kills and 48 total points.</p>\n<p>“[The Van Windens] are both great players and sure will get some kills,” Lantagne Welch said. “What we have to prevent is either one of them taking over. Keep them to reasonable numbers.”</p>\n<p>Not happy with her team’s defensive performance last weekend against Hawaii, Welch has made that area of the game a focus in practice leading up to the Cal Poly match.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors, another Big West powerhouse, never hit below .200 in any of the four sets on Saturday, something that UCSB won’t survive a repeat of against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, the Gauchos will get a second crack at Cal Poly and another chance to pull off the major upset.</p>\n<p>All it’s going to take is excellence in every facet of the game, this time for more than one set.</p>\n<p>UCSB travels to San Luis Obispo to take on Cal Poly on Friday night at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 2nd, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/","id":4966,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4965,4964,4963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joe Pasternack and the Gauchos Storm Into the T-Dome for Exhibition Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Gabe-vincent-cutout.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Gabe-vincent-cutout.png?resize=683%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Head Coach Joe Pasternack and the UCSB men's basketball team are set to make their debut with an exhibition game this Saturday.

Jackson was a three-year starter at Rice, while King II played in 20 games for Nevada last season after transferring from Brown University.</p>\n<p>Last season, Jackson was the third leading scorer on the team with 12.2 points per game, while his 2.3 assists ranked second best on the team. The Acton, Calif., native had season-ending knee surgery during what would have been his junior season in 2015-16, one year after averaging a career-high 14.5 points per game and leading the conference in three-point makes with 85 of them.</p>\n<p>King II averaged 3.7 points and 2.6 rebounds per game with the Wolf Pack and 12.1 ppg and 6.5 boards per match in two seasons at Brown. King II graduated from Nevada last year with a degree in business.</p>\n<p>Both players are expected to start and contribute right away to a Gaucho team that struggled in all facets of the game last season. Joining them will be a plethora of returners, including seniors Gabe Vincent, Alex Hart and Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the former, Vincent is coming off an ACL tear that ended his season back in February. Before that, the shooting guard was one of the few bright spots UCSB could count on as, before missing the final eight games of the season, he was averaging 14.8 points per game along with 3.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per match.</p>\n<p>Despite the injury, the Stockton, Calif. native is still a well-respected figure in the Big West basketball community, as he was the only Gaucho named to the Big West All-Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>Due to his barely getting back into game action for the first time in a while, expect Vincent to have his minutes limited Saturday, as well as maybe the first few games of the season, before making a return to the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>For Canty, this is his second year as a Gaucho after transferring from community college. Like Vincent, Canty was getting better with each game throughout the season, at one point leading the Big West in rebounds, but was sidelined for all of conference play due to academic ineligibility.</p>\n<p>In 10 games last year, the big power forward averaged 10.2 points per game along with 7.0 boards. This summer, Canty has worked incredibly hard in both the classroom and the weight room, as he is eligible to play, and he has slimmed down considerably in hopes that it can help diversify his game.</p>\n<p>The last senior on the team, Hart, was one of the main threats for the Gauchos when Canty was ruled ineligible to play. Last year, Hart, who plays center, played in all 28 games for UCSB, averaging 7.6 points per contest. He was able to really improve in his final eight games of the year, scoring in double figures four times, including a season-high 16 points twice.</p>\n<p>Other notable players to watch out for will be sophomore guard Clifton Powell Jr., who was a sparkplug off the bench for the ‘Chos last season, sophomore guard Max Heidegger, who had an average slash line of 7.6/2.1/1.4, and junior forward J.D. Slajchert, who brings tremendous energy every time he is out on the court.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the court, Fresno Pacific will also be looking to improve off of an average season that saw them go 7-20 on the year but 7-13 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Sunbirds were tapped to finish 11th in the PacWest Conference and had no players named to the preseason all-conference team.</p>\n<p>Under second-year Head Coach C.J. Haydock, FPU will look to rely on senior center Oliver Herting, who only averaged 6.5 ppg and 1.6 rebounds but is one of the few remaining members, as the team has added nine newcomers to the squad this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match won’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of the score, as they are expected to bull over their opponent, but what will be important is how they look doing it. With many new pieces in Santa Barbara, it will be interesting to see how Pasternack could make it all work.</p>\n<p>The team has been predicted to finish sixth in the conference this season.

That can largely be attributed to the strange way UCSB suddenly went into a slump.</p>\n<p>Without two of their best players in sophomore utility Ivan Gvozdanovic and junior driver Boris Jovanovic, the Gauchos have had to make considerable adjustments offensively and defensively.</p>\n<p>In response, the young Santa Barbara roster has been forced into action, which has definitely shown throughout their five-game slide, but the Gauchos have impressed their coaching staff in showing resilience as well as improvement.</p>\n<p>Although they lost a close match against Irvine in their last game, the Gauchos’ energy seemed to have returned, as they put together a comeback effort and rallied behind senior attacker Shane Hauschild.</p>\n<p>On the season, Hauschild has been one of the only bright spots, especially as of late, leading the team in almost all categories: steals (25), goals (28), points (42) and assists (14).</p>\n<p>Even though Hauschild recorded five total goals against Irvine, he can’t be expected to put up the same numbers against a better Pacific team, at least not without more help from his teammates.</p>\n<p>Granted, the sudden absence of Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic, two relied-on scorers, would throw a wrench into any program’s game plan, but the Gauchos have the weapons capable of making up for the lost production.</p>\n<p>Freshmen attackers Cole Brosnan and Jesse Morrison, in addition to redshirt freshman Adam Lott, have been part of the young supporting cast for the Gauchos, but they will still have to find a way to contribute more in order to take on the Tigers.</p>\n<p>With the Serbian duo out, senior utility Reed Cotterill has shown glimpses of last season, during which he was selected to the GCC All-Tournament Team.</p>\n<p>Cotterill, coming from Australia, likely has more of a green light in terms of looking to score if the Gauchos remain without their two former goal-leaders.</p>\n<p>An obstacle for UCSB this season has been a difficult schedule, but the Gauchos are familiar with playing the top programs in the country on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Despite their recent struggles, the Gauchos can find hope in the fact that Pepperdine last year ended up winning the GCC tournament while doing poorly during the season.</p>\n<p>If Hauschild and Cotterill bring the same energy to the pool that they brought against Irvine, the young supporting cast of Gauchos will likely be able to rally around their talented seniors and should, in turn, have a shot at the upset.</p>\n<p>Cotterill, specifically, will aim to take some of the load off Hauschild early on, as the Tigers will likely prepare to stop the man who had a hat trick within the first quarter last game.</p>\n<p>Pacific, coming off a close loss on the road against UCLA, will look to regroup before playing Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The UCSB coaching staff will have a difficult time preparing to stop the Tigers, as the Tigers’ offense is decently dispersed through a handful of scorers.</p>\n<p>In just three conference games, the Tigers have put up 37 total goals from nine different players, whereas the Gauchos have scored just 21 goals during the same number of conference games.</p>\n<p>A standout for Pacific, in particular, is redshirt sophomore Luke Pavillard. The Australian native has scored 52 goals overall on the season while also contributing 24 assists.</p>\n<p>Pacific showed in its most recent game that it can score rapidly and sporadically, as the Tigers posted a 6-1 fourth quarter in a comeback effort that would ultimately fall short against the Bruins. While Pacific will clearly want to utilize its offensive power, UCSB will have to do its best to contain any rapid scoring by the Tigers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will probably turn to a slower, more methodical game relying on key defensive stops in order to match up with the No. 5 team in the nation.</p>\n<p>The action will begin at Campus Pool on Friday, Nov. 3, at 7 p.m. at the No. 10 Gauchos look to get their first conference win of the season over the No. 5 University of Pacific.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 2nd, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79487\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/chos-hit-the-road-in-hopes-of-capturing-1st-conf-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79487\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/chos-hit-the-road-in-hopes-of-capturing-1st-conf-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/chos-hit-the-road-in-hopes-of-capturing-1st-conf-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/chos-hit-the-road-in-hopes-of-capturing-1st-conf-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/chos-hit-the-road-in-hopes-of-capturing-1st-conf-victory/","id":4890,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[4889,4888,4887],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prepare for Preseason Showdown With CSU East Bay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-09-print.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-09-print.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Basketball officially returns to the Thunderdome this Saturday when the Gauchos host the CSUEB Pioneers.

Signing after the Gauchos’ tournament run was junior guard Akilah Jennings, who transferred to UCSB after one year at Northern Colorado and one season at Foothill College.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar, who sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules after her departure from Seattle University, will be making her Gaucho debut this year.<br>\nUpon entering Saturday’s matchup, UCSB was tabbed to finish third in the Big West standings in both of the conference’s preseason coaches’ and media polls.</p>\n<p>Presuming that its starters will play for only the first quarter at most, Santa Barbara’s exhibition will serve as more of an experimentation period with its lineup considering some players will be sidelined.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting and a good opportunity for us to play somebody else. The third chapter might start with a bunch of Band-Aids on it because we’re a little dinged up, but at least it’s November,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’re going to hold Drew [Edelman] out because she’s got a right thumb that’s been sore. We’ve got a couple more bodies in that we didn’t have a week ago so we’re still a work in progress. For those that have been out and are coming back in, [the most important thing] is for them to get some reps and be in practice every day as their growth continues.”</p>\n<p>According to Henrickson, other Gauchos who have experienced offseason injuries and are gradually making their way back include sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez, Bates and Quintino.</p>\n<p>While exhibition games typically result in a Division I program facing some lower-tiered Division II, III or even less reputable schools, the Gauchos are going against one of their best preseason opponents of the Henrickson era on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Cal State East Bay enters the 2017-18 season with momentum following a 22-9, 16-4 CCAA record with the guidance of then first-year Head Coach Shanele Stires. Within the past two years, the Pioneers have made back-to-back Division II NCAA tournament appearances after capturing consecutive CCAA women’s basketball tournament titles.</p>\n<p>East Bay won 11 of its last 12 regular season games going into the CCAA tournament, where it won three straight games to win the title before losing to Western Washington in the first round of the DII NCAA West Regional.</p>\n<p>How CSU East Bay will do on the offensive end is most intriguing following the loss of former guard Shomari Harris, who led both the CCAA and Pioneers in scoring with 17 points per game (PPG). Another senior that will be missed is former center Remy Puou, who was the team’s second leading scorer with 10.2 PPG.</p>\n<p>Despite its DII status, East Bay presents a challenge that could possibly deliver an exhibition game that possesses a regular season feel, which is competition the Gauchos are ready to embrace.</p>\n<p>“When you’re scheduling [games dating back] a year ago, considering our anticipation of returning to the Big West tournament, it’s the right thing to do [to challenge ourselves],” Henrickson said. “We’re going to play against some players that we haven’t seen in their system. We’re trying to dig up some film on what they looked like last year. There’s going to be some things that we’re going to see that we’re not going to be able to anticipate. But then that’s where the use of timeouts and communicating in huddles help to make some adjustments on the fly.”</p>\n<p>With very little weighing on the outcome of Saturday’s exhibition, not much pressure is on UCSB, who won’t be at full health when they compete. With just one preseason game before its regular season tip-off, the Gauchos still have a chance to set a precedent as to what they hope to become this year.</p>\n<p>The exhibition between UCSB and CSUEB will take place in the Thunderdome at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Nov. 2, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

team’s disappointing 4-1 loss to archrival Cal Poly on the road, the UCSB men’s soccer team saw one positive come out of last weekend and that was the 3-0 loss that third place Sac State experienced to UC Davis; meaning that the second place seed was no longer up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, UCSB’s 15 total points in the standings have the team at 2<sup>nd</sup> overall on the Big West league table and the Big West North. The winner of the Big West South, Cal State Fullerton, only finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the Gauchos’ regular season campaign featured a conference record of 4-3-3. The team proved to be inconsistent at times whether it is at home or on the road, but dominant enough to net them yet another playoff berth. Overall, the Gauchos finished 6-7-5.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Concerning statistic, the team only totaled 13 goals across nine matches, yet held opposing sides to 17 scores against them. However, as much as this speaks volumes for both the offensive and defensive sides for the Gauchos, the team still can cherish a combined 3 clean sheets on the year to go with their quarterfinalist position.</p>\n<p>When reflecting back at previous analysis to commence the season; not many would’ve figured UC Davis to have topped not only their division but also the entire Big West board.</p>\n<p>This is due in part because of their early first-round exit in last year’s playoff. Nonetheless, the Aggies appear to be the team to beat and the Gauchos have yet to beat them even after two encounters this season. In fact, UCSB was outscored in those two contests 8-0.</p>\n<p>Now, UCSB will look ahead to their first-round opponents as they draw UC Riverside at home to kick off the postseason. The Highlanders finished their collegiate season with an overall record of 4-12-1 and 4-5-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>One of those five conference losses came in an out of division matchup, on the road, against UCSB. The result was ultimately a 3-1 victory for the Gauchos, but thanks to the whopping 10 total saves from UC Riverside’s goalkeeper Vincent Morales, the score didn’t run up anymore.</p>\n<p>Besides a very talented goalie, the Highlanders also boast a fairly prolific goal scorer in junior forward Antonio Lokossou.</p>\n<p>He currently leads his team in the goals category with a total 5 tallies and also maintains the most shots at goal with 26 on the season. Paired with the team assist team leader of sophomore forward Anthony Lopez who has three helpers and two goals to his name, the Gauchos would be wise to game plan with these two in mind.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Rodney Michael once again stepped up for his time and netted the redemption score in their previous 4-1 loss. On the year, Michael continues to lead his team in both categories with eight goals and three assists (tied with Ignacio Tellechea).</p>\n<p>Easily claiming the team’s regular season MVP consideration, his success also extends to a league level as he is tied for second most Big West goals scored and third most shots taken.</p>\n<p>Michael also earned Big West Freshman of the Year and Big West All-First Team Honors.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Alan Carrillo will also be a big key to the Gauchos postseason success if they enjoy any. The La Mirada native has allowed nine of his 24 goals allowed in the last three games.</p>\n<p>His 1.27 goals against average still rank fourth in the Big West, and his 50 total saves rank sixth, however, he must play better if he hopes to lead the Gauchos to the semifinals.</p>\n<p>He, alongside Michael, was named to the Big West All-Freshman Team while senior defender Randy Mendoza was named to the All-Big West Second Team.</p>\n<p>With a hopefully continued success through the postseason, and if the Gauchos could relocate their once solid defensive line, then UCSB can very well consider a deep run in the Big West playoff race.</p>\n<p>From here on out it’s simple, single elimination games and Wednesday’s victors will land themselves a ticket to Saturday’s semifinal games; thus propelling them that much closer to the following week’s Big West Finals and that coveted championship title.</p>\n<p>Big West early round championship locations still remain on campus sites, so the Gauchos will be hosting UC Riverside this Wednesday, November 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Jack Trush, Kyle Trush’s brother, scored for UCI with 1:56 to go, burying the Gauchos 5-3 for the first half of play.</p>\n<p>To start the second half, tensions rose after a few controversial calls and non-calls. This would show throughout the second half, as players would be ubiquitously tangled up with each other as they moved down the pool.</p>\n<p>At 6:21 in the quarter, Hauschild scored his fourth goal of the day with another strong shot from the top of the key to put the Gauchos within a goal. The Santa Barbara native seemed to be proving something during Friday’s contest, perhaps having his best game of the year but even more importantly driving the Gauchos’ attitude.</p>\n<p>With just under four minutes remaining, Kyle Trush added a goal for the Anteaters, giving them the advantage 6-4. Irvine’s scoring would continue to come in bunches, with the freshman Schuetze scoring at 2:11 to put the Anteaters up 7-4.</p>\n<p>Then, with 1:50 to go, Adam Lott scored off an assist from Hauschild to make it 7-5.</p>\n<p>Following an odd series of calls from the referees, Irvine’s Jack Trush was able to score with 21 seconds left. With the clock winding down, UCSB’s Cole Brosnan got the ball and made a nice move to score at the buzzer.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final 8 minutes, Irvine held an 8-6 advantage. A goal by sophomore attacker Jacob Halle at 5:52 in the quarter made it 8-7. Following Halle’s goal, the game featured minutes of rough fouls and the crowd giving the referees some advice and it looked like the chaos was helping neither side.</p>\n<p>Finally, at 2:40 to go, Kyle Trush converted to give the Anteaters the 9-7 lead.</p>\n<p>A penalty shot from Shane Hauschild with 2:16 left gave Hauschild his 5th goal of the day and moved the Gauchos within one.</p>\n<p>With 1:22 remaining and only down one, Reed Cotterill finessed an over the shoulder shot from set to tie the game 9-9. The senior added the exclamation point by facing the crowd and pumping his fist, giving the Gauchos momentum and a comeback hope.</p>\n<p>A focused defensive stand by UCSB ended in a deflating goal by Irvine’s Lovre Milos to give the Anteaters the 10-9 lead with 34 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t come up with a tying goal in their last possession, giving Irvine the victory.</p>\n<p>Justyn Barrios had another big day in the cage, despite being scored on ten times, as he had 11 saves. A few of those saves were one-on-one with an opposing player when the sophomore goalkeeper came up huge for the Gauchos in preventing the score from getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>For a young UCSB team that’s still without two of its best players, the loss can’t be too much of a surprise or even a deterrent. Last year’s Gold Coast Conference championship was won by Pepperdine, a 4th seed in the tournament, so the Gauchos have opportunities remaining.</p>\n<p>“We know there are hard games down the stretch, and I think this game showed any of these games you can come in and win. Whether we win or lose these games, we just want to be playing well,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said, “I thought we played well.”</p>\n<p>Although it still has a chance for postseason glory, this is the UCSB team that has now lost 5 straight. With or without their two better players of Ivan Gvozdanovic and Boris Jovanovic, the Gauchos will have to make some quick adjustments.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos haven’t been too far off, as they’ve shown signs of dominance earlier in the season. UCSB has a considerably young roster and so obviously the consistency that comes with a mature team hasn’t been prominent late in the season, but Friday’s tightly-contested matchup with Irvine showed promise for UCSB’s developing players.</p>\n<p>“We fought back a couple times and I was really proud of the effort of the guys,” Wigo noted, “a lot of the younger guys played some great minutes.”</p>\n<p>They’ll just have to channel that energy and follow the leadership of Shane Hauschild as they prepare to play their final games of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s penultimate match will be at 7 p.m. on Friday, November 3 against Pacific at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Michael’s scoring shot was the first UCSB since the Oct. 18 match against Sacramento State where Michael again scored all two goals of the match for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were offensively active, taking six shots in the first half, but only Michael’s was able to find the net.</p>\n<p>The play between the two teams was back and forth during the first half, much like the last meeting between the two familiar clubs.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 43rd minute when sophomore Kenneth Higgins received a heads-up pass from teammate Jared Pressley and took a shot that went just to the left of a diving Alan Carrillo.</p>\n<p>The point was not only the Mustang’s first of the match, but it was also Higgins’ first goal of the season and the equalizer left it all even at halftime, 1-1.</p>\n<p>If the story at the end of the first half was yet another Cal Poly &amp; UCSB draw, the Mustangs were quick to change that as less than four minutes from the beginning of the second half, senior Adam Olsen found himself at the far post when the ball deflected towards him and the senior was able to tap the ball into the net for the lead, 2-1.</p>\n<p>Olsen’s mark on the match was not left at the eventual game-winning goal, as the senior lobbed a high arcing pass to a waiting Kaba Alkebulan in the 51st minute, who ran past a defender to find himself alone in the box, who headed it past Carrillo, putting Cal Poly ahead 3-1. It was Jared Pressley who scored the final goal of the match in the 65th minute as the Mustangs would go on to win 4-1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the Gauchos did not find themselves ready to play their last minutes of the 2017 regular season, they did find themselves looking to make the Blue-Green Rivalry their last chance to get some momentum headed into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Throughout the month of October, UCSB has only won two games out of the eight they have played. The team has split the remaining matches between three losses and three ties.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Conference Tournament will begin on Wednesday, November 1 where the number two seeded UCSB Gauchos of the North Division will host the number three seeded UC Riverside Highlanders of the South Division.</p>\n<p>In their only match of the regular season, the Gauchos hosted the Highlanders and subsequently won the match 3-1.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79369\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79369\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/","id":1388,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1387,1386,1385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Team Takes a Humble Approach to Start the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-31-at-1.15.36-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-31-at-1.15.36-AM.png?resize=859%2C539&ssl=1","description":"With the official start to its 2017-18 season just weeks away, the UCSB women's basketball team is hoping to remain consistent going into its third year of the Bonnie Henrickson era.

By the grace of the ball clanking off the rim’s lip after a left corner three-point shot by Porter, the 49ers defeated the Gauchos 56-55.</p>\n<p>Despite the heart wrenching loss, the Gauchos will enter the new season with a confidence knowing that they’re capable of making that next big step: an NCAA Tournament appearance.</p>\n<p>“Pressure is a privilege. It’s nice to talk about the expectations. But I have to go back to Coach [Mark] French, and I’m a caretaker of a program that man built. We walk by 14 [Big West] trophies every day,” Henrickson said. “Concerning the ‘expectation,’ as a staff, we’ve done a good job of not talking about how the championship game ended. If that’s all we talk about, then you don’t have time to talk about culture, competitiveness, character and unselfishness, which are all of the things that gave us a chance at the end. [Of course] our players have an expectation to have a great year which comes about from the hard work it takes. Part of the excitement with this senior group and Sarah as a junior is how much they’ve gotten better since we’ve left Anaheim to now. For us, it’s about getting better every day.”</p>\n<p>Excluding what takes place on the court, each of the mentioned qualities truly does stick with each player and their mindset.</p>\n<p>Making the difference for Porter, who sat out in Henrickson’s debut year due to NCAA transfer rules, has been one specific dimension of the team’s dynamic: Culture.</p>\n<p>“Since day one, Coach Bonnie has talked about turning the program’s culture around,” Porter said. “She and the coaching staff have done so. I’m excited for the freshmen on the team because they’re joining a program that is going to make them better both on and off the court.”</p>\n<p>During the time in which she sat out, Porter was able to witness this culture manifest itself from the ground up. Usually displaying a reserved yet competitive demeanor while on the court, Porter’s poise are elements that have been further developed by Henrickson’s culture since being at the helm.</p>\n<p>It’s a characteristic that resonates throughout the program from top to bottom.</p>\n<p>As the leader of the pack, following a year in which she led both UCSB in scoring (11.7 points per game) and the Big West in field goal percentage (61.4), Edelman senses that the Gauchos’ potential still sustains much upside.</p>\n<p>“Last year was a rebuilding year. This year is totally different,” she said. “We have such better attitudes going around, better energy and everyone is working well together. Last year I didn’t want to overstep my [boundaries] since I was new and I didn’t really know how the team played together yet.

The defender knocked in her first goal of the year off of Colby Parker’s corner kick, and the moment was even more special as it was her last game as a Gaucho.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half played out evenly for both sides, although UCSB did get off many more shots than Cal Poly a number of quality shots for both squads were pretty equal and the goalkeepers for both squads had to make multiple saves to keep their teams alive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The physical nature of the Blue-Green rivalry also was present in the first half, even if it was the Gauchos who were often the aggressors (they doubled Cal Poly’s foul count in the first half 8-4) both squads had plenty of hard challenges that contributed to the chippy atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs must have taken the physicality to heart as they came out guns blazing in the second half, and found the mark in the 47th minute of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again it was a senior scoring in her last game, except this time it was midfielder Emily Hansen who knocked in the game-tying goal after Brittney Rogers couldn’t corral a Cal Poly freekick.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB dominated the half, however, tallying seven shots to Cal Poly’s one the Gauchos were operating at a high level on the offensive end for the last 40 minutes of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They weren’t able to put one shot past Mustang goalkeeper Sophie Brown however as the sophomore had a stellar half, stopping four shots in the half itself and totaling nine on the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The saves didn’t seem to affect the Gauchos who continued to attack the Cal Poly goal until the very last minute of regulation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going into the first overtime not much changed for the Gauchos while Cal Poly brought three pairs of fresh legs in. It was UCSB who looked like they had a boost of energy however as they put three shots on goals in the first overtime period, and if not for the heroics of Brown they almost certainly would have ended up winning the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The keeper made the three saves, however, and neither team took a shot in the second overtime period leading to the 1-1 tie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this wasn’t the result the Gauchos hoped for coming into their season finale, the game actually provided a lot of positives going into the offseason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The play of Christine Maurer continues to be a shining spot as the freshman showed countless times this year that she has potential to be a top player in the league in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great defense that the team played on Sunday also was emblematic of how good UCSB has been defensively to end the year.

That’s when we started rolling.”</p>\n<p>In the next set, however, Hawaii returned the favor. The visitors came flying out of the gates and took the first seven points of the set, pushing the Gauchos onto their heels from the outset.</p>\n<p>The onslaught continued mostly unabated for a while, as the Rainbow Wahine ran out to a 16-3 lead thanks to a barrage of kills. UCSB managed to stem the flow of blood at that point, and mus red two separate five-point runs to close the gap a little bit, but the deficit was ultimately too large to overcome.</p>\n<p>“Volleyball is a funny game, it comes in waves,” Nicole Welch said. “We were just a little rough early and we had to steady out. You’d think you’d be ready and fired up, but it was just a bit off to start the match.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii managed to hit above 20 percent in all four matches, a major contributing factor to their win on Saturday. Sophomore McKenna Granato led the Rainbow Wahine attack with 21 kills, a typical result for the standout outside hitter, and added 17 digs for a solid double-double.</p>\n<p>“Probably our biggest disappointment (Saturday) was our defensive effort,” Welch said. “That’s been really strong the last week or so and we really didn’t do a good job. We weren’t following our scouting report like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense might not have been clicking the way Welch wished, but the team’s service game was almost impeccable. UCSB had a season-high 14 kills, with Hasselmann’s six leading the way.</p>\n<p>“(Hawaii) has a really good middle, so part of our strategy was if we get them out of system, we don’t have to deal with her,” Welch said. “Obviously we wanted to serve aggressively and we were going to be okay with a few errors if we went at them really hard.”</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins led all players Saturday with 23 kills, and the redshirt sophomore chipped in 16 blocks as well for a double-double of her own. It was an excellent performance by any measure for the outside hitter, but one that the reigning National and Big West Player of the Week has managed to make almost ho-hum, a testament to her season-long run of dominance.</p>\n<p>Outside hitter Chloe Allen, who missed eight matches with an injury in the middle of the season, seemed back to full form Saturday evening. The sophomore posted 16 kills, her second-highest total of the season, and provided the Gauchos with a formidable second weapon.</p>\n<p>“Chloe struggled the last week and she really came to life (Saturday),” Welch said. “That’s important for our team, and for our team moving forward, so that was a great plus.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next match is versus Cal Poly at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, November 3 in San Luis Obispo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Wednesday night, much was at stake for the UCSB men’s soccer team. The Gauchos were in search of clinching the No. 1 seed in the Big West North Division standings in their final home match of the season.</p>\n<p>A 0-0 draw was the final result of the weekday game as neither of the two teams managed to net goals during the 90 minutes of regulation play.  Nearly changing the match’s narrative was the forward-to-forward connection of freshman Rodney Michael and sophomore Ignacio Tellechea.</p>\n<p>In the match’s 58<sup>th</sup> minute, Michael sent a cross from the wing of the field to Tellechea, who then struck the ball into the net. Unfortunately, the play was called offside and the score still remained 0-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“If you think about it, that right there was the four, five goals we needed. So, in the end, it just comes down to personnel and the function of forwards [not making plays quick enough and passing] and playing as forwards,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-6-5 and 4-2-3 in the Big West, while Sac. St. sits at 8-7-2, 4-3-2. Santa Barbara came into the match second in the division with 14 points, while Sac St. was third with 13.</p>\n<p>Following Wednesday’s match, no changes took place in the North Division standings as the Gaucho-Hornet stalemate led to one point for both teams, leaving UCSB in second (15 points) and Sac St. in third (14 points), however, UC Davis was crowned the Big West North Division champion after its 2-1 victory over Cal Poly on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The game whistle sounded and both teams were off to a booming start. The Sac State Hornets were the first to strike as Gaucho freshman keeper saved an open shot on goal. This would be the first of only two on target shots the Hornets had all night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then peppered in a couple shot of their own, but besides foul trouble from both ends, the rest of the first half remained pretty stagnant regardless of all the team substitutions. Both teams would end up with a combined total of 33 infractions on the night.</p>\n<p>A standout moment in regulation, was when a Red Card was given to the Gaucho bench in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute, in response to their passionate reaction to what the team felt was a no call.</p>\n<p>As for the second half of play, UCSB went ahead and took reign of possession. This eventually proved to be a recurring theme for the home side as it seemed every following counterattack was called offside as well leading to the Gauchos seventh overtime match of the season, the fourth that went into OT tied 0-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were instantly aggressive in the opening minutes of the first OT period, attempting three corner kicks in a row, but to no avail. There was only one shot attempted in the second OT period for either team, and that shot was by senior Kim.</p>\n<p>The lack of playmaking ability from the midfield was prevalent as all key passes from half field just seemed to be swallowed up by the Hornet defensive line. In the end, the end of the game had arrived and both teams settled for the draw.</p>\n<p>“Our forwards are young; they work hard and have loads of talent. But passing is sometimes an afterthought for them. So when they finally get into that situation, it’s too late, which is why we need a guy that can get up the field and make those passes,” Vom Steeg said. “Subsequently, it’s forward passing to forward so these passes end up being too short, too far or behind. Which is when the goalie comes running up at you and you won’t have enough time to run around him or chip the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this was the case for both teams. Regardless of all the counterattacks and offside calls, neither side was able to pull the trigger and earn the winning goal. Whether it was nerves or just quality defense on both ends, it was a great showing no doubt.</p>\n<p>Senior night was also upon us and some of the Gauchos were about to play their final regular season home game of the season. Players being honored recognized for their contribution to the team included: seniors Seo-In Kim, Omar Montalvo, Josue Salgado, Alex Liua, and Randy Mendoza. Each of these players started or were subbed throughout the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now head away for their last game of the season as they face Cal Poly in the last installment of this year’s Blue Green men’s soccer rivalry beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 28 at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/","id":1386,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1385,1384,1383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Aim to End Season on a Positive Note vs Blue-Green Rival","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite not having any playoff implications, the Gauchos will still be looking to knock off their big-time rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79111\" style=\"width: 489px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/sydney-magnin-settles-a-pass-from-downfield-hallie-browndaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79111\" data-attachment-id=\"79111\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/chos-aim-to-end-season-on-a-positive-note-vs-blue-green-rival/sydney-magnin-settles-a-pass-from-downfield-hallie-browndaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-07-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sydney Magnin settles a pass from downfield.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite underwhelming efforts in the wins columns — UCSB at 6-8-4, 2-4-1 and Cal Poly at 7-9-2, 2-4-1 — they each have remained solid on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Cal Poly place third and fourth in the league in goals scored, with one goal separating the two at 23 and 22, respectively.</p>\n<p>One player who has contributed to this boost in offensive production by the Gauchos is freshman Christine Maurer. Maurer is second in goals (6) and shots (41) along with being tied for third place in the Big West in goals as well.</p>\n<p>The midfielder scored the game-winning goal against UC Davis last week and could be adding another one to her tally of netters against a Cal Poly team that is tied for second in the Big West in goals given up with 24 on the year.</p>\n<p>This stat is both advantageous and a concern for UCSB as it is the team that the Mustangs are tied for second with.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos have actually tightened up on defense as of late. They haven’t allowed more than one opponent goal in their last five games while Cal Poly has given up two goals in two of its last four.</p>\n<p>The play of UCSB’s goalkeeper, Maddie Julian, who is third in the league in goals against with only 11 so far, is certainly a big part of this recent stinginess.</p>\n<p>It also certainly helps to have a senior defender like Kate Shoemaker in the back for better communication as well.</p>\n<p>Communication and help on the defensive end are going to be crucial against this Cal Poly team who likes to attack individually and take lots of shots.</p>\n<p>Although they are ranked top four in the conference in goals, the Mustangs are tied for second to last in assists (14).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos are going to need a strong ‘man-on-man’ performance, in addition to an efficient effort when providing help defense as the Mustangs thrive on opponent errors and low pressure around the top of the box.</p>\n<p>One dimension the Gauchos will need to improve on is not falling behind early in the game. In almost all of their wins, they’ve scored first.</p>\n<p>This goes to show that their style of play is great at retaining leads; however, their losses show that they aren’t as good at playing from behind.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this game still means a lot for UCSB. Although they are out of the playoff picture, they still have a chance to climb up a few spots in the standings.</p>\n<p>Finishing the season off strong also is important for gaining motivation in the off-season and following season.</p>\n<p>Lastly, for a few of these players, this will be their last time stepping out onto Harder Field, and an opportunity to beat the Mustangs on a day like that is one that they can only hope to capitalize upon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Sophomore Justyn Barrios is fourth in the GCC in saves with 100 on the season.</p>\n<p>An interesting development for the Gauchos this season has been the absence of stars Ivan Gvozdanovic and Boris Jovanovic. The Serbian duo had accounted for over a quarter of UCSB’s points and roughly 27 percent of Santa Barbara’s goals (as of Oct. 9).</p>\n<p>Without Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic, the Gauchos have understandably struggled to muster enough offense to take down opponents. In the last game that the Serbian duo played in, Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic scored a combined four goals, but the Gauchos haven’t won a game without them since.</p>\n<p>The absence couldn’t come at a worse time, either, as Santa Barbara had to face No. 1 USC and then go on the road for three more competitive games against some of the nation’s top programs. Although the absence of two of its best players provides some leeway for the team’s recent decline, it appears that if UCSB remains without Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic, it will have a rough end to the season. Friday’s game against the Anteaters should provide concrete insight regarding the expectations the team could potentially meet as things begin to conclude.</p>\n<p>“It’s not fun when some of your best players aren’t playing,” Wigo said, “but it gives a chance for other players to rise up.”</p>\n<p>Because the end of the season is near, the outcome of Friday’s game against the Anteaters will likely indicate the Gauchos’ fate this year. If Santa Barbara loses, the Gauchos will be 0-3 in the GCC and below .500 overall all while losing 5 games in a row. This isn’t an ideal situation for any team at the end of the season, especially a team whose two players accounting for a quarter of UCSB goals this year have been absent.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, since the Gauchos have already beaten the Anteaters once this year, they’ll be able to use that experience to their advantage. If the Gauchos pull off the upset, they will at least snap their losing streak and be above .500 overall.

It was a challenge that he embraced.</p>\n<p>His offensive prowess is not to be overlooked as he led the Celtics to the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference just last season. Not one soul in Boston could forget the tragic night Thomas’ sister passed away in a fatal car crash.</p>\n<p>Just days after, Thomas played in Game 2 of the team’s Eastern Conference Semifinal matchup versus the Washington Wizards, on the day that would have been his sister’s 23rd birthday. Thomas went off for 53 points in what was a thriller of a 129-119 OT win for the Celtics.</p>\n<p>So, with all of his undeniable guts and glory, why would Boston feel the need to trade Thomas?</p>\n<p>The answer is simple: Boston business.</p>\n<p>This concept of doing what it takes to win is nothing new for Boston, as it is the most storied sports city in the nation.</p>\n<p>Irving is an offensive powerhouse with more length and the gift of time on his side. Younger, faster and NBA Finals experienced, it is clear that Irving is a much better player than Thomas.<br>\nIrving is a commanding player who could lead the Celtics and possibly give them the edge versus a Cleveland team who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the last season’s NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Fans say it’s wrong and broadcasters ask, “Where’s the loyalty?”</p>\n<p>But has it been forgotten that just a few years back, when New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe went down against the New York Jets in 2001, a young Tom Brady took the starting quarterback position out from under him because of his superior play? In 2013, the Boston Bruins traded away a young Tyler Seguin, who was said to be the future of the team, for reasons never disclosed but was undoubtedly a move to make the team better.</p>\n<p>Loyalty is not a plausible factor in the sports world, at least not when it comes to Boston.</p>\n<p>Boston will do what it takes to win because that is the culture of the winningest city in the nation.</p>\n<p>Boston knows nothing other than winning, and this is nothing new. It’s easy to question the aspect of loyalty when you are faced with the unknown.</p>\n<p>When Brady took over for Bledsoe in 2001, nobody knew that he would later be considered the greatest of all time.</p>\n<p>There were still some who wanted Bledsoe back in his starting role when he came back healthy. Instead, once Head Coach Bill Belichick committed to Brady as his starter, he did what some thought to be a vicious move — he traded Bledsoe and did so within his own AFC East division to the Buffalo Bills.</p>\n<p>This move wasn’t made out of malicious intent; rather, it was made to make the Patriots team even better as they acquired the Bills’ first round pick in 2003 in exchange for Bledsoe.</p>\n<p>It was obviously the right move to start Brady because the Patriots have since gone on to win the Super Bowl in 2002, 2004, 2005 and most recently in 2015 and 2017.</p>\n<p>The same can be said with the Celtics. Though the trade of Thomas looms over as a cloud of uncertainty, in addition to having to deal with the loss of Gordon Hayward for the season, the fact remains that Danny Ainge and the front office believe the Thomas-Irving move will make the team better.</p>\n<p>Boston is a city of champions, and no sense of loyalty to a player will keep that mentality alive, but keeping the business-savvy outlook of winning will. Being willing to do whatever it takes to keep the team successful, no matter how controversial, is one of the many qualities that separates Boston from the rest.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 26, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/","id":1877,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[1876,1875,1874],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":44,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
