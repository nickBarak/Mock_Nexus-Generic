The other two, seniors Shyan and Tori Tsolis, both 1500 runners, were unable to reach their full potential to secure a spot in the following round.</p>\n<p>On the men’s side, Vaziri had high hopes for his prospects coming into the weekend but couldn’t quite put it all together on Saturday. He ended up finishing eighth in his heat and 32nd overall in his event with a time of 3:48.74, outside of the pool of qualifiers for nationals. This was disappointing considering the fact that he was ranked No. 9 in the West to start off the regionals.</p>\n<p>For the women, Tsolis came into the regional ranked at No. 15 in the 1500 but finished her heat with a 4:35.44 time that left her in the nine spot in her heat and the 40th spot overall.</p>\n<p>Also competing in the 1500 was junior George Baier, who finished 45th overall with a run of 3:56.01. He finished 12th in his heat.</p>\n<p>Three athletes represented UCSB in the javelin throw with two competitors on the men’s side and one on the women’s side.</p>\n<p>Senior Melissa Rake finished in 17th place in the women’s section with a toss of 47.56m for a fifth-place finish.</p>\n<p>For the men, junior Matthew Kuskey finished in 18th with a throw of 65.22m. He was fourth in his heat. Fellow junior Darion Williams was unable to record a qualifying toss.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the men’s team’s work were the performances of sophomore hammer thrower Jeremy Franklin and junior hurdler Myles McDonald.</p>\n<p>Franklin threw 61.69m to finish fifth in his heat and 15th overall in his event, just three spots away from qualifying for nationals.</p>\n<p>McDonald came close to qualifying but was unable to close it out. He ran a 51.86 second race in the 400m hurdles, finishing third in his heat and 18th overall.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho women’s team was completed by a couple freshman jumpers and a junior in the steeplechase.</p>\n<p>Freshman Alivia Schlueter jumped 11.59m in the triple jump, finishing 11th amongst her heat and 44th overall.</p>\n<p>Freshman pole vaulter Sierra Emrick leapt 3.82m to place 22nd in her heat and 44th overall.</p>\n<p>To round out the crowd, junior Maxine Goyette ran a 11:06.90 in the 3000m steeplechase to finish 15th in her heat and 43rd overall.</p>\n<p>Senior high jumper Emde will be competing in the NCAA Championships at Eugene, Oregon, next Wednesday through Saturday, June 8-11.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71545\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71545\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/","id":5702,"author":{"id":318,"name":"Duncan MacPhee"},"related":[5701,5700,5699],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Regular Season With Disappointment","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos lost their final series of the regular season but still have high hopes in making the NCAA tournament for the second year in a row.

Although it lost its final series, Santa Barbara still has a solid chance of making the 64-team NCAA tournament thanks to its fourth straight 30-plus win season. The Highlanders finish their 2016 campaign 26-29 overall, 12-12 Big West and finish tied for fourth in the conference standings, their best finish in the conference since 2010.</p>\n<p>UCSB closed the season on Saturday at home but had a very disappointing outcome, as it was shut out for only the second  time this season with the final score being 6-0. It was also disappointing for the two seniors, third baseman Ryan Clark and pitcher Justin Kelly, as they lost their final home game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The guys were trying but UCR played really well,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We couldn’t capitalize on some plays. It was one of those games.”</p>\n<p>UCR took an early 1-0 lead after the first inning; then both teams traded scoreless innings until the fourth. The Highlanders then blew the game open in the fourth and fifth innings as they scored two runs in both innings to take a 5-0 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>After adding one more run in the eighth inning, which would be the final run of the game for both teams, the game felt out of reach not just because of the 6-0 scoreboard but because of the lack of consistency on the Gauchos’ side.</p>\n<p>UCSB combined for only five hits on Saturday compared to UCR’s 11. Three of Santa Barbara’s biggest hitters, redshirt junior Andrew Calica, redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno and sophomore Austin Bush, had a terrible day as they combined to go 0-12.</p>\n<p>Clark and Kelly had decent outings in their final home games of their careers. Clark was one of only four Gaucho hitters to register a hit on the evening, while Kelly went 2 2/3 innings deep striking out four batters while also surrendering four hits and two earned runs.</p>\n<p>For UCR, junior Mark Contreras had a solid day going 3-5 (.600) with one RBI and freshman infielder Yeager Taylor hit his third home run of the season to end his first year on a high note.</p>\n<p>Before a frustrating loss to end the season, UCSB’s Shane Beiber battled hard for his team on the mound and led his team to a 2-1 victory to tie the series up for the time being.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was in control for most of the game as it scored one run in the second after an error by the visiting team and one in the forth after redshirt sophomore Josh Adams hit an RBI single to score catcher Dempsey Grover.</p>\n<p>Beiber was also amazing for his duration as he pitched an almost full game. In his 8.2 innings, the right-hander allowed six hits and one earned run, which came in the top of the ninth.</p>\n<p>UCR attempted to make its comeback in the ninth inning as redshirt senior Drake Zarate hit a home run to make the score 2-1. After the home run, the Gauchos brought in their ace reliever, redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson, to get the final out which he successfully did to get his eighth save of the season.</p>\n<p>Beiber picked up his Big West best 11th win of the season and became the first UCSB pitcher to pick up that many wins in a season since 1983. It was also his 22nd career victory, which is tied for third best in program history.</p>\n<p>Before that solid victory, the Gauchos started the series off the wrong way as they played a sluggish game that led to a frustrating and disappointing 3-1 loss.</p>\n<p>UCR got off to a quick start as Contreras hit a sac fly RBI to get his team on the scoreboard first. In the fifth frame, the Highlanders added two more runs thanks to junior Aaron Cisneros’ RBI single and Taylor’s sac fly RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded with a run in the bottom half of the fifth courtesy of Calica’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>However, that would be the only life UCSB could find all day as in the final four innings it was shutout not only on the scoreboard but on the hit column as it could not muster a measly single.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Sodders had a great game for UCR picking up his sixth win of the season after allowing only six hits all game and one run in seven full innings of play. Alex Fagalde finished the game in the ninth to pick up his third save of the season.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos had arguably their worst weekend of the season as they only scored three runs in three games while only registering 17 hits.</p>\n<p>It definitely was not something the team wanted to have as postseason play approaches, but it did, and UCSB will try to power forward and try to do some damage if it gets into the tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have to come back together and play well.” Checketts said. “Some guys are getting frustrated and we just have to regroup.”</p>\n<p>The NCAA will announce their 64-team tournament at 9 a.m. PST Monday, May 30.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

With a day one win, Santa Barbara had to face the No. 1 seed in the tournament in No. 2 nationally ranked junior Hayley Carter and senior Whitney Kay of North Carolina.</p>\n<p>Carter and Kay cruised past the first round themselves as they won two sets consecutively, 6-3 and 6-2, against Nour Abbes and Miki Kobayashi from Washington.</p>\n<p>The second day was not going to be a cake walk for either side as both teams entered the court with confidence.</p>\n<p>UCSB started off strong after a closely contested first set. The Gauchos won the opening set 6-4, but lost the following set by an identical score.</p>\n<p>On the verge of a major upset, Stojic and Dubavets managed to force a third set. Despite keeping the score close in a back and forth matchup, the Tar Heels evaded the Gauchos’ possible spoiler victory, winning the final set by a score of 10-7.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara exited the tournament sooner than it would have liked to, expectations for next season remains at an all-time high; especially when examining the fact that these two young tennis stars have only played one year together and have one more year ahead.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71559\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71559\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/","id":1108,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1107,1106,1105],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Secure Third in Conf.

RPI is used to rank sports teams based upon a team’s wins and losses and its strength of schedule, which currently stands at 19, the best of any team on the West Coast.</p>\n<p>Although slim, it is possible that UCSB could also jump up to second place in the conference standings if it were to sweep UCR, in addition to a series loss by Long Beach State, who is currently in second place in the conference.</p>\n<p>For the Highlanders, this weekend will be their last regardless of the outcome. Although they have won series over quality opponents such as LBSU and Cal Poly, they have not been consistent enough to be a great team. UCR has lost six of seven matches twice this season.</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos need to watch out for is junior outfielder Vince Fernandez, who was recently named Big West Player of the Week for his performance this past weekend in which he batted 10-19 (.526), scored six runs and batted in six over the course of four games.</p>\n<p>Fernandez currently leads the team in batting average (.361), slugging percentage (.529), on-base percentage (.439), runs scored (39), hits (75), RBI (41), home runs (8) and walks (28).</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to counter with strong hitters of their own such as sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (43) and home runs (7). When its hitting is on point, Santa Barbara looks nearly unstoppable. In the 20 games this season UCSB has gotten at least 10 hits; it has been able to come away with victories in 17 of those occasions.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also look to take advantage of the fact they are at home since they have scored 166 runs at home this season compared to 94 on the road. They also bat and get on base 60 points better at home while also pitching an ERA of 3.70 at home, which is much better compared to 4.49.

Two of the Gauchos’ three highest individual event rankings appear in this race.</p>\n<p>Senior Shyan Vaziri is the highest seed of any UCSB athlete in each of their respective events at No. 9 in the men’s 1500 with an impressive qualifying time of 3:42.23. Assistant Coach Peter Van Beurden and the rest of the team/coaching staff are excited to see what he has in store for them this weekend.</p>\n<p>“I can really speak on Shyan’s behalf that his goal is to be there with the top guys and to make it all the way to the final rounds of nationals,” Van Beurden said. “I think he’s definitely going to be focused and confident heading into these rounds, and he has some experience too.”</p>\n<p>Vaziri is one of three total athletes that will represent Santa Barbara in the preliminary round of the 1500, including somewhat of a surprise qualifier in junior George Baier (3:45.56) in the No. 45 slot on the men’s side as well.</p>\n<p>The third Gaucho qualifier in the event is grad student Victoria Tsolis on the women’s side, who boasts a No. 15 ranking in her best event with a UCSB record qualifying time of 4:19.02.</p>\n<p>Both Tsolis and Vaziri have had their sights set on nationals all season long, and now that they are both just one step away, it’s become a much more realistic goal.</p>\n<p>“I think the best shot [might be with] Shyan and Tori, just because they have all that experience, that championship experience, and they kind of know how to run their race,” Van Beurden said. “They have that finishing kick that’s necessary to make it through the round.”</p>\n<p>Another athlete who has set herself up to have a great shot at the next round is senior high jumper Jessica Emde, who is looking to get to nationals for the first time in what will be her third regionals appearance. Emde is ranked highest of all the Gaucho women with a No. 14 seed that she earned with a qualifying leap of 1.79m in her event.</p>\n<p>“I think that she finally has the tools that she needs to survive a meet like this,” Assistant Coach Cody Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Other Gaucho athletes qualifying for this weekend include three javelin throwers: juniors Matthew Kuskey and Darion Williams for the men along with senior Melissa Rake for the women.</p>\n<p>“My ‘jav’ throwers are healthy, their approaches are on and as a javelin thrower, you can’t ask for anything more than that,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>The last two spots on the men’s qualifying group are filled by sophomore Jeremy Franklin in the hammer throw and junior Myles McDonald in the 400m hurdles.</p>\n<p>The women’s qualifying squad also includes junior Maxine Goyette in the 3,000m steeplechase, freshman Sierra Emrick in the Pole Vault and upstart freshman qualifier Alivia Schlueter in the triple jump.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Pete Dolan is excited to see what his athletes can do this weekend with the opportunity to put themselves in nationals.</p>\n<p>“Top 48 in the west, top 48 in the East. Nobody gets through on a pass, nobody gets a prior PR, it’s just like you’ve got to compete on that day [to] make it through,” Dolan explained. “That’s the coolest thing about the meet.

The recruited players are familiar with the big moment and are ready to make an impact immediately, and they could very well compliment an experienced squad of UCSB players.</p>\n<p>Kicking off the top of the Gauchos’ recruiting class, junior college transfer and Community College Player of the Year Jalen Canty provides a much-needed presence on the block that UCSB will lack next year with the departure of seniors Beeler and Brewe.</p>\n<p>Starting all 33 games for the City College of San Francisco last season, the 6-foot-7-inch, 245-pound forward proved to be essential to his team’s success, averaging nearly a double-double with 13.1 points and 9.1 rebounds per game to help lead his team to a CCCAA State Championship.</p>\n<p>A defensive liability on the boards and versatile back-down post player, the former Washington State commit will be seeing quality rotational minutes from Williams and should mesh well with the team’s current arsenal of athletic forwards in Jarriesse Blackmon, Alex Hart and Ami Lakoju.</p>\n<p>Canty also has some ongoing chemistry with sophomore Gabe Vincent as both were former teammates on the AAU Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>Among other post-man recruits for Santa Barbara is the 6-foot-8-inch senior out of Besant Hill Academy, Felix White. A candidate for the First Team All-CIF Division VI, the international forward from Nigeria has the tangible skillset and basketball IQ necessary to excel at the next level.</p>\n<p>Aside from his team-leading averages of 17.3 points per game and 10.6 rebounds per game during his senior year, White compiled a cumulative 3.42 GPA during his three years at Besant Hill. This intelligence in the classroom is a trait White hopes to translate onto the hardwood next season against much bigger, faster and smarter talent in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With Big West premiere players such as Bryson and Green sealing their legacy in a blue and gold uniform, Santa Barbara will have to anchor itself with a new core of scorers this upcoming year.</p>\n<p>Surely Vincent and junior Eric Childress will be fundamental assets to the team’s offense; however, the two Conference Honorable Mentions now have some help with a collection of new wing players seeking to make an impact.</p>\n<p>Christian Terrell, Max Heidegger, Mickey Mitchell and Clifton Powell Jr. are all incoming talents capable of stretching the floor and attacking the basket.</p>\n<p>Terrell and Powell, both 6-foot-4-inch combo wings, add to the long list of versatile two-guards under Coach Williams. Named one of the elite players in the area by the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>, Terrell finished his four-year tenure at Sacramento High with a total of 1,279 points. The All-Metro conference player can be a threat on the perimeter, averaging a 35 percent shooting percentage from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Powell, a fifth-year senior out of Woodland Hills, CA has also grown in his scoring ability and lengthy frame as a result of an extra year at 22ft Prep School Academy in South Carolina. A bouncy guard with a knack for knocking down the three, both Powell and Terrell could stand as crucial second-string pieces that fill the void for key bench players T.J. Taylor and DaJuan Smith.</p>\n<p>In addition to these shooting guards are floor generals Heidegger and Ohio-State transfer Mitchell. Heidegger, a 6-foot point guard from just down the road at Oaks Christian, fits in a somewhat smaller category of Division I players, yet his ability to drive, kick and finish at the rim makes him an ideal player under Williams’ guard-oriented system.</p>\n<p>Though transfer regulations will force the 6-foot-7-inch Mitchell to redshirt this upcoming season, the combo forward could possibly have a substantial role in the future with three full years of eligibility remaining at UCSB.</p>\n<p>As the six seniors continue onward to their next phase in life, another set of basketball talent looks to carry on this culture of excellence and mold a new identity for the UCSB men’s basketball team. With pure skill meeting a hungry squad unsatisfied with last year’s Big West Semifinal loss, Williams and his crew might have more of a rewarding season than expected heading into early November.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 26, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/","id":336,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[335,334,333],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Add Six Recruits, Earn No. 24 Class","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Arguably the program's worst season ever, after a 7-20 overall and 3-13 Big West finish, the UCSB women's volleyball team will attempt to avenge its poor performance with a No. 24 recruiting class tha...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After recording program lows in overall and Big West wins with a 7-20, 3-13 eighth-place finish last season, it can be assured that the UCSB women’s volleyball program is determined to redeem itself in the 2016 season.</p>\n<p>Currently in her fourth year as Head Coach, Nicole Lantagne Welch will look to recapture the winning chemistry that amazed many in her debut season with the school in 2013, in which she helped lead the Gauchos to their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2010.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71389\" style=\"width: 566px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71389\" data-attachment-id=\"71389\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gauchos-add-six-recruits-earn-no-24-class/devin-joos-reaches-to-pass-a-short-ball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Devin Joos reaches to pass a short ball.

A four-year member of the varsity team, Allen also played for Santa Barbara Club Volleyball.</p>\n<p>Boasting a .362 hitting percentage at the end of her senior year, Rice presents a dual-threat skillset that can be productive both on the offensive and defensive sides of the net. Hailing from Redondo Union High School, she posted 32 kills and six blocks in a regional semifinals match this past postseason.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping her team win a Division IAA Championship her sophomore season, Rice’s high school career also includes a Third-Team AVCA All-America selection, 2015 Conference I Player of the Year honors and more.</p>\n<p>With a total of three middle blockers on its current 2016 spring roster, much intrigue has been directed towards the additions of Ennis and Robinson who both play the position as well.</p>\n<p>Preparing to make the trek from Virginia to Santa Barbara, Ennis attended First Colonial High School, where she put together an illustrious career with a program-record 1,340 kills. She is another proven winner added to the Gauchos’ roster, helping the Patriots win back-to-back Conference I Championships in 2013 and 2014. Ennis topped off her time spent playing in high school as an Honorable Mention AVCA Under Armour All-America recipient.</p>\n<p>Selected as one of the nation’s top 150 players in the nation in <em>Prepvolleyball’s</em> “Senior Aces” list, Robinson will enter UCSB next season after time spent with one of California’s best programs at Marymount High School of Palisades, Calif. Prior to the start of her senior season earlier this year, Robinson was ranked 16th amongst current players in the state in total kills.</p>\n<p>Helping ensure that plays and rotations go as planned will be the additions of libero Maxine Burke and Wisconsin transfer setter Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>Hoping to complement the play of sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi, a member of the Big West All-Freshman Team, Burke will be added to another impacted position as the Gauchos currently have three liberos aboard their team.</p>\n<p>Coming out of JSerra Catholic High School, Burke also played for Tstreet Volleyball Club. She was a Trinity League Second-Team selection in her senior season.</p>\n<p>The only player of this year’s recruiting class to participate on UCSB’s spring team, as other recruits wait to graduate, Juley will not have to redshirt in her first year with the Gauchos after redshirting her freshman year with the Badgers.</p>\n<p>Averaging 11.4 assists and 2.6 digs per match her senior year of high school, she helped Lyons Township High School earn a West Suburban Silver Championship. From LaGrange, Ill., Juley was an AVCA First-Team All-American in 2015 along with other accolades as she finished with 1,590 assists and 523 digs in her high school career.</p>\n<p>Assisting Coach Lantagne-Welch prepare this year’s team will be the hiring of Chad Gatzlaff as an assistant coach. He spent the last three seasons at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>\n<p>Along with Petrachi, another Big West All-Conference selection will be looking to have another productive year in senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt. For the second time in her career, Grunt was named a Big West Honorable Mention after ranking third in the conference in hitting percentage with a .335 average.</p>\n<p>Thus far, UCSB has played in three matches this spring. Beginning with its alumni match on April 9, Santa Barbara has faced Loyola Marymount and UCLA over the past two months.</p>\n<p>Although the preseason predictions of the Big West Media Poll are not always accurate in where teams will end up by the end of the season, last year’s third-place expectation may have been too much for the Gauchos, who declined after a 4-1 start to the season before enduring an 11-match losing streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 2016 regular season schedule has yet to be revealed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 26, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71429\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gauchos-add-six-recruits-earn-no-24-class/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71429\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gauchos-add-six-recruits-earn-no-24-class/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gauchos-add-six-recruits-earn-no-24-class/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gauchos-add-six-recruits-earn-no-24-class/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gauchos-add-six-recruits-earn-no-24-class/","id":5369,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5368,5367,5366],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Strong Pair Heads to Oklahoma for NCAA Tourney","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a successful regular season campaign, doubles pair junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets will look to dominate at the NCAA D1 Doubles Tournament beginning today.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1464150558792_2242\" class=\"yiv4529867077MsoNormal\"><span id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1464150558792_2241\">The UCSB women’s tennis team has concluded its season hitting all the major goals that Coach Simon Thibodeau had challenged its team to accomplish.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71388\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71388\" data-attachment-id=\"71388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-25/gauchos-strong-pair-head-to-oklahoma-for-ncaa-tourney/amanda-atanasson-returns-the-ball-to-the-opponent-jenny-luo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Amanda Atanasson returns the ball to the opponent.

The Bulldogs finish the season at 33-17 and will look to get back to its winning ways as, before the two-game losing skid they are currently on, they won eight straight.</p>\n<p>Gonzaga started off fast as sophomore outfielder Tyler Frost drove in three runs off a double to center field, taking an early 3-0 lead for his team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB responded in the bottom of the second frame as an RBI double from junior utility player Billy Fredrick and an RBI single from freshman infielder Tevin Mitchell made the score 3-2 still in favor of Gonzaga.</p>\n<p>It would not be long before the Bulldogs struck back, as the next inning redshirt sophomore infielder Nick Brooks hit a two-run homer to left field to make the score 5-2.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded with a run of its own in the bottom half of the frame to cut the lead to two runs, but that would be their last run for a long while.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the UCSB pitching staff responded by not allowing a single run in the final six innings to keep Gonzaga at five runs and setting up a chance for the Gauchos to win in walk-off fashion for the third time at home this season.</p>\n<p>The rotation consisted of freshmen Kyle Hatton, Kevin Chandler and Noah Davis. Hatton allowed all five runs during the first three innings, but in the final four he pitched, he allowed no runs and only three hits.</p>\n<p>Chandler pitched the eighth, allowing only one hit, while Davis pitched the ninth, allowing only two hits, picking up the win and making his record 5-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the final inning, the Gauchos batting finally came to life as they were able to score three runs on four hits to pick up a walk-off victory in its final nonconference game.</p>\n<p>The comeback began when redshirt junior infielder Ryan Cumberland hit a sac fly to right field to make the score 5-4. The redshirt sophomore JJ Muno hit an RBI single to tie the game up at five.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore Clay Fisher flied out, moving Mitchell to third to become the possible go-ahead run. Then sophomore Austin Bush was up to the plate. The Gonzaga pitcher walked him while also throwing a wild pitch on the fourth ball, which scored Mitchell and sealed the Gauchos 6-5 victory.</p>\n<p>It was another solid win for a team striving to rack up the victories as postseason play approaches. The 64-team NCAA tournament will be announced next Monday.</p>\n<p>With its final series coming up and 36 solid wins on the season, clinching a series win over UC Riverside and maintaining a third place standing in the conference should be enough to get the team into the postseason. However, there is still work to be done, and it will be interesting to see how this young team closes the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is against UCR at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium beginning Thursday, May 26 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In the fourth inning, the Gauchos were finally able to get on the board after a Kyle Plantier RBI single that brought them within four runs.</p>\n<p>After three more scoreless innings in the fifth, sixth and seventh, Bush finally struck in the eighth inning, hitting a grand slam to center field and tying the game up at five apiece. It was the first baseman’s seventh home run of the season and the first four-RBI homer of his young career.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover drove in the leading run, redshirt sophomore JJ Muno, for the Gauchos first lead of the game. It was Bush who struck yet again as he drove in three more runs with a double to left center, scoring Grover, redshirt junior Devon Gradford and redshirt sophomore Clay Fisher, making the score 9-5 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>That would end up being the final score of Sunday’s game after redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson picked up his seventh win of the season, bouncing back from a tough loss the previous night as he struck out two of the last three batters.</p>\n<p>Bush also became the first Gaucho to have a seven-RBI game in nearly 10 years as now UCSB assistant coach Chris Valaika hit seven against UC Davis on May 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Before clinching a tough road series victory, Santa Barbara suffered a heartbreaking 5-4 loss that came down to the final pitch and a throw from Muno that was just off.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were up 3-0 early after scoring two runs in the second and one run in the top of the third frame before UCI countered with three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning courtesy of sophomore infielder Cole Kreuter’s two-RBI triple and redshirt senior infielder Grant Palmer’s RBI sac fly.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters then took the lead after junior Adam Alcantara drove in a run to make the score 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied the game in the seventh inning thanks to redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s bunt, which scored Tevin Mitchell after a throwing error by the UCI pitcher.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, UC Irvine had a chance to win the game in regular innings as it had the final opportunity in the bottom of the ninth. After loading the bases thanks to a single, a walk and a hit batter, Alcantara had a chance to drive in the winning run to go home winners or hit into a double play that would end the inning.</p>\n<p>The junior decided to go with the former and drove in John Brontsema to secure the 5-4 win. That, however, does not mean the play was not dramatic. Alcantara hit a line drive to left field, where third baseman Muno snagged it on a beautiful dive.</p>\n<p>Then an off-balance Muno tried to throw the ball to home plate to get the runner out but it was a bit out of the catcher’s reach and Brontsema was able to score.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLt1BhfzgbsF30dnjYcB4kmrtryqjRQ4U1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>It was a heartbreaker for the Gauchos and for Nelson, who picked up his second loss in less than a week after starting the season with a perfect 6-0 record. However, the right-hander was able to bounce back in Sunday’s game, proving why he is on the watch list for the top pitcher in the country.</p>\n<p>Before that gut-wrenching loss, UCSB was able to start the series off the right way and pick up a solid 10-3 victory to set the tone for the rest of the matches.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the top of the third, where UCSB picked up three runs thanks to Muno’s RBI single and Grover’s two-RBI single. UCI countered in the bottom of the frame with one run courtesy of Alcantara’s RBI single, making the score 3-1 after three innings.</p>\n<p>Both teams scored two runs in the fourth inning to keep the lead the same for the Gauchos now at 5-3.  In the sixth, UCSB extended its lead by adding a run thanks to Mitchell’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, Santa Barbara really did some damage, capitalizing on an error by UCI to score one run and a balk by the pitcher which scored another run, making the score 8-3.</p>\n<p>Calica would drive in the final two runs in the same inning thanks to a single to right field, making the score 10-3. Both teams were unable to score after that, making the final score 10-3 in favor of the road team.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber had another solid day at the office, allowing 11 hits and three earned runs but striking out 10 batters while pitching his fourth complete game of the season. Bieber (10-3) is now only the 12th pitcher in Gaucho history to reach 10 wins on the season.</p>\n<p>It was a solid weekend overall for UCSB, whose season is coming to a close. It was a great way to end its average road record while also helping them pick up momentum as the playoffs approach.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game is at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium against Gonzaga at 3 p.m. on Monday, May 23.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

This unique mold of “strength” fits the character of 6-year-old Leah Still.</p>\n<p>A full-time daughter, “Uptown Funk” dancer and cancer survivor, Leah has permeated the hearts of many during her road to recovery. Daughter of current Houston Texan and former Cincinnati Bengal defensive tackle Devon Still, the two have come a long way since their experience of misfortune in June 2014.</p>\n<p>The then 4-year-old Leah was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma, an aggressive disease which attacked the preschooler’s vital glands and yielded a 50/50 chance of survival. The odds were unfavorably stacked against the NFL player and his daughter.</p>\n<p>While tears and agony barely consoled the hearts of her friends and family members, oddly enough the 4-year-old girl took on her challenge with a collected mind and grin on her face.</p>\n<p>After undergoing four months of radiation, surgery and remission treatment, results indicated a steady decline of Leah’s harmful tumors. There was no doubt about it: The upbeat child was beating cancer.</p>\n<p>Much like his daughter, who faced this dreadful disease head on, Still did not let this alarming setback hinder him from assisting his daughter. He wrote the slogan “Leah Strong” on his nasal strip every time he stepped on the field, and this motto quickly circulated through the nation, making everyone aware that Leah’s fight was bigger than she was.</p>\n<p>Fans on and off the gridiron showcased their united support for the 26-year-old Still, including the Bengals organization, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and New Orleans Saints Head Coach Sean Payton, who bought 1,000 Devon Still jerseys in response to the lineman’s cause. In total, over $1 million were raised for his daughter and other families locked in a similar battle with pediatric cancer.</p>\n<p>The brave Leah also received recognition from celebrities at the 2015 Espy Awards. Earning herself the Jimmy V Award, the highest honor for courage and perseverance, Leah officially joined the ranks of sports heroes such as the late Stuart Scott, former Rutgers star Eric LeGrand and Hall of Famer George Karl who have had their medical battles recognized on a grand scale.</p>\n<p>A successful triumph over life’s biggest obstacle led young Leah to become the flower girl in her father’s wedding last Sunday. Full of life and energy and ready for the big stage, it was Leah who stole the show on her father’s big day with her moves on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>This moment was a celebration of a new chapter in the Still family, but more importantly it signified a celebration of life itself. Leah’s battle with cancer was finally over. She surmounted her biggest obstacle, and that is definitely a moment that everyone could enjoy.</p>\n<p>Leah’s story is the story of a little kid with a big heart which warms the minds of many, a girl whose narrative proved to be just as inspiring as those of the athletes we adore today.</p>\n<p>On that day of matrimony for Devon Still, his daughter was not just his flower girl. She was a fighter, who persevered and is a living testament to the fact that when life’s struggles try to bring you down, you can still remain strong within.</p>\n<p>It is this idea of “strength” that will carry on in Leah Still forever.</p>\n<p>#LeahStrong</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Thunder forward Kevin Durant’s step back dagger of a jump shot with 30.7 seconds remaining was a silent reminder of who reigns supreme in the team’s coveted 1-2 punch made up of himself and Russell Westbrook.</p>\n<p>Despite a 10-30 shooting night, going 2-11 in the fourth quarter, KD stayed committed to what each and every generation of shooters and scorers are told: KEEP SHOOTING.</p>\n<p>Surpassing LeBron James as the NBA’s best player in some fans’ player rankings just a few years back, it seems as if many have forgotten about the former 2013-14 MVP, four-time scoring champion and seven-time All-Star in lieu of Westbrook’s breakout seasons over the past year and a half.</p>\n<p>Ruled out indefinitely after playing in 27 games last season due to a Jones stress fracture in his right foot which required three surgeries, Durant’s hype gradually faded away as his body of work was slightly overshadowed by the championship run of Curry and the Warriors, LeBron’s return to Cleveland and the post All-Star break outburst of his teammate Westbrook who ended the 2014-15 season with eleven triple-doubles.</p>\n<p>With Westbrook tying NBA legend Erving ‘Magic’ Johnson’s all-time single-season record of 18 triple-doubles this season, notions of Durant as the Thunder’s secondary option became more convincing than ever.</p>\n<p>While the glitz and glamor of triple-doubles can be mesmerizing, has anyone taken the time to acknowledge the expense Westbrook’s success has come with?</p>\n<p>Sure, Westbrook led the league in scoring last season with an average of 28.1 points per game, yet he led the NBA in turnovers per game with 4.4 and nearly replicated these results this season, finishing just behind James Harden with 4.3 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>Although Westbrook missed 15 games last season due to injury, which hindered OKC’s pursuit of securing the eight-seed, he was one of the most inefficient players during clutch periods of games in the regular season.</p>\n<p>According to <em>82games.com</em>, “clutch’ is defined as the period of the fourth quarter or overtime with less than five minutes left and neither team is ahead by more than five points. Westbrook’s volume of shots in late game situations display the ball dominance that occasionally detracts from the point guard’s impact on the court.</p>\n<p>Based on production per 48 minutes of clutch time, Westbrook averaged 51.2 total points, a scoring total that ranked third in the league. The five-time NBA All-Star was insufficient with his shot selection, taking 49.9 field goal attempts while shooting just 38.3 percent from the field and an abysmal 0.87 from beyond the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As expected with the return of Durant, Westbrook’s shot attempts in clutch time have endured a substantial decrease, which has served to his own benefit. Prior to the beginning of the NBA Playoffs, Russ concluded the season 14th in points with a 39.3 average on 32.1 field goal attempts in addition to shooting 38.9 percent despite a subpar 20.0 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>Aside from three-point percentage, KD has actually been more efficient in his return this season than his 2013-14 MVP campaign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71133\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71133\" data-attachment-id=\"71133\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/fullsizerender3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=566%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,165\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender(3)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=250%2C73&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=566%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71133\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?resize=566%2C165\" alt=\"Statistics courtesy of 82games.com\" width=\"566\" height=\"165\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?w=566&amp;ssl=1 566w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?resize=250%2C73&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71133\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Statistics courtesy of 82games.com</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71134\" style=\"width: 581px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71134\" data-attachment-id=\"71134\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/fullsizerender4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=571%2C195&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"571,195\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender(4)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=250%2C85&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=571%2C195&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71134\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?resize=571%2C195\" alt=\"Statistics courtesy of 82games.com\" width=\"571\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?w=571&amp;ssl=1 571w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?resize=250%2C85&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Statistics courtesy of 82games.com</p></div>\n<p>Certainly one must consider the major constraints of OKC’s roster last season; he lost some of its scoring with the trade of Reggie Jackson to the Detroit Pistons and had to acclimate the role of Enes Kanter into the lineup after receiving him from the Utah Jazz in a three-team trade including the New Orleans Pelicans and lost Serge Ibaka for 18 games due to injury. It’s easy to argue that Westbrook had no choice but do to it all on his own.</p>\n<p>However, the team went 7-4 in the 11 games in which the Thunder’s floor general recorded a triple-double. Nonetheless, Oklahoma City endured two losing streaks of two or more games during his scoring, rebounding and assisting run. Nonetheless, the team finished 2-9 when Westbrook scored 40 or more points last year.</p>\n<p>Yet in his eighth season it has been a milestone season for Westbrook. Along with tying Magic’s triple-double record, Westbrook set a career-high in assists per game with a 10.4 average, his first time in double-figures.</p>\n<p>Arguably one of the NBA’s top five players, the aim was never to degrade the outstanding talent and determination of Westbrook but rather to remind those that KD is the driving force in Oklahoma City potentially becoming the next world champions.</p>\n<p>Currently third all-time in career points per game with a 27.4 average, Durant was the first introduction of many NBA fans of our generation to the hybrid, big-man-with-finesse playing style that is commonly witnessed today.</p>\n<p>Not one sign of regression appears in KD’s game thus far, surpassing the Black Mamba’s streak of consecutive games with 20-plus points at 67 games.</p>\n<p>In comparison to who many consider today as the NBA’s best player in Steph Curry, KD finished with a comfortable difference against the back-to-back MVP who had a scoring stretch of 20-plus for just 14 games earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>Both 27 years old and in their primes, inevitably the Durant-Westbrook duo will go down as one of the best player combinations in NBA history. Yet while KD’s game on the court may not be the most illustrious to the eye, the label as the league’s best could be most fitting with the “Darantula” in years to come.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71131\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71131\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/","id":3306,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3305,3304,3303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season Wrap Up: UCSB Softball Ends 28-28 Overall","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to cap off the season winning four of its last six games, the UCSB softball team's season came to an end last Saturday in the team's road series at Cal State Fullerton.

Complementing these school records were 25 home runs and 256 RBIs in the team’s 56 game schedule. The longest winning streak the Gauchos managed to attain throughout the season was over the span of four games during their non-conference schedule which began at the Stacy Winsberg Invitational. In addition, on four separate occasions the Gauchos achieved a three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the season, the Gauchos had both impressive collective performances as a team and from individual players. The young, raw talent this team possessed managed to contribute to multiple victories this season and formed a foundation that will continue to benefit the team for years to come.</p>\n<p>Various players on the team emerged with admirable performances throughout the year. Senior infielder Arianna Palomares had a great end to her softball career ranking second in totals of 30 runs scored, 37 RBIs, 55 hits and 10 doubles which tied sophomore Jessica Johnston as a team-high.</p>\n<p>While batting third in the Gaucho lineup, she delivered clutch hits all year long and showed durability by playing in all 56 games and leading the team in at-bats with 180.  By the end of the season, Palomares had a .363 on base percentage, a .411 slugging percentage and a .306 batting average.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for UCSB, junior outfielder Kristen Clark will return for one more season, as she has been a valuable asset and leadoff hitter on this team since her freshman year. Clark made big improvements this season, earning multiple team highs and personal records of her own. Clark excelled with an outstanding .402 batting average for third best in the Big West, finished with an incredible .457 on base percentage and a .447 slugging percentage. Hitting atop the Gaucho lineup, Clark also led the team with 41 runs, 72 hits and 17 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer played at a veteran level in her first season as a Gaucho, tallying a team high 42 RBIs to rank third in conference play, and performed best when under pressure. Altmeyer had a team high 12 doubles and seven home runs while scoring 20 runs, and led the team with 20 extra base hits. Often batting cleanup, she finished the season with a whopping .500 slugging percentage, a .297 batting average and drew 22 walks to lead the team alongside Johnston.</p>\n<p>Aside from tying for the team lead in walk, sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston had an overall stellar year, and should be a force in the heart of the Gaucho lineup for years to come. She finished with a solid .322 batting average and a commanding .418 on-base percentage, both good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>The second year player also led the team with three triples, was second with six stolen bases and had 14 extra base hits. As stepping into the batter’s box is a risk each time, Altmeyer constantly displayed her grit and determination when facing pitchers despite being hit by a pitch seven times this season.</p>\n<p>Another key component to the Gauchos’ lineup was junior infielder Emily Brucelas, playing in all 56 games and ranking second on the team with five homeruns. She registered 50 hits, 13 extra base hits and 26 RBIs this year while scoring 27 runs.</p>\n<p>Also contributing was freshman infielder Melanie Menor with 47 hits on the year, none bigger than the clutch two-out home run she delivered against Fullerton to give the Gauchos the lead and the win on the last day of the season.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow had an outstanding year to close out her collegiate career, oftentimes putting the team on her back when they needed it most. Ludlow managed a stellar ERA of 2.87. She collected 10 wins on the season, pitching 41 games and tallied an impressive 157 strikeouts in 178.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin also found her place on the team earning eight wins this season while pitching 113.1 innings in 35 games with a 3.52 ERA.  She showed up on the mound in crucial times, striking out 62 hitters. Gulvin was reliable in the pitching rotation, and also provided a dependable go-to arm when senior starter Ashley Ludlow needed relief.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have many things to be proud of this season. For the first time in four years, UCSB swept rival Cal Poly and went 3-0 against UC Davis. As a team, the Gauchos scored 246 runs, had a .370 on base percentage and a .397 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>With most of its roster returning, there is no doubt that this team has a bright future ahead.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71100\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71100\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/","id":1183,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1182,1181,1180],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Checketts’ Method: A Winning Culture Reborn","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Since his arrival in 2011 and his coaching debut in 2012, Head Coach Andrew Checketts has brought a winning culture back to UCSB baseball.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71112\" style=\"width: 327px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71112\" data-attachment-id=\"71112\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/checketts-method-a-winning-culture-reborn/christinademarzo_andrewcheckettsbaseball_5-14-16_2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71112\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?resize=317%2C479\" alt=\"Head Coach Andrew Checketts has changed the culture of Gauchos Baseball.

The reason is simple: athletes don’t want to go play at a university where they won’t be competing for championships and garnering the exposure needed to reach the pro level.</p>\n<p>To turn around a program requires effort, dedication, money, but most importantly, it requires instilling a culture. Usually a program needs to instill a new culture to bring back a sense of attitude, and a new fire to show recruits that this will become a winning program.</p>\n<p>The UCSB baseball program is something that definitely needed a culture change back in 2011 when it was looking for a new head coach after the departure of Bob Brontsema who is still at UCSB, now serving as the assistant athletic director.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brontsema was a great coach as he attained the most wins in school history (483) after an illustrious 18-year career in which he also finished with the third best winning percentage (.503) in school history.</p>\n<p>Although Brontsema was a solid coach during his tenure, it was clear that after a 10-year hiatus from reaching a NCAA regional and not having won a Big West championship during his run, it was time for a change.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, a young, eager assistant coach awaited his coaching opportunity located in Oregon. A man who was renowned as one of the best pitching coaches in the entire nation as well as a great recruiter. His name is Andrew Checketts.</p>\n<p>Checketts was no stranger to California or the Big West conference as he coached at UC Riverside for four years prior to becoming an assistant coach at Oregon. He knew about UCSB, and once he heard about the vacancy, he held hope that maybe he would get that call so he could finally become a head coach for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>“When I heard the job become available I thought ‘I’d love to live in Santa Barbara and coach there,’” Checketts said. “That same day I went on a walk with my wife and kids, and, I’m not kidding, I got that call. At first I thought it was too good to be true so I sent it to voicemail, but when I check it later that day it was the AD [athletic director] asking me if I was interested and, of course, I was.”</p>\n<p>On June 22, 2011, UCSB announced that Andrew Checketts would become the ninth head coach in program history.</p>\n<p>Checketts knew the expectations of UCSB’s program and was more than ready to bring a new culture to the university’s ball club — something he has definitely instilled in the short five years he has been here.</p>\n<p>In his first season as the baseball coach, Checketts had 16 seniors on his squad to help make his transition a bit easier and managed to hire the right assistant coaches in play.</p>\n<p>“I knew the first thing any good head coach needs is a great staff, so the first person I got was [Eddie} Cornejo and he has been great,” Checketts said. “We assembled the best staff we could and quickly started trying to figure out what we wanted and how we wanted it done.”</p>\n<p>During his first campaign, the former Oregon State High School Player of the Year impressed everyone as he had the most wins by a first-year head coach in school history with 28. Checketts, who also serves as the teams pitching coach, had a historic throwing rotation that combined for a program best 451 strikeouts on the season.</p>\n<p>Although it was yet another year, the Gauchos did not go to an NCAA regional; everyone knew that the future looked bright. However, Checketts knew that the future would only be bright if he brought in a great group of recruits.</p>\n<p>Although money might have been tight at times, Checketts saw the potential UCSB had to offer young student athletes and began working his recruiting magic right away. In 2012, Checketts held the 18th best recruiting class — the best in school history to this day — 39th in 2013 and 32nd in 2014 all according to <em>Perfect Game</em>.</p>\n<p>“I think kids want to come to UCSB,” Checketts said. “It has unbelievable academics, great baseball weather and amazing location. I think this is one of the best places to go to school on the earth so it makes my job easier.”</p>\n<p>Since that first year in 2012, every year has been an improvement for the UCSB baseball team. The following year in 2013, the Gauchos broke their postseason curse and reached their first NCAA regional for the first time in 12 years, ending its last 22 games with a 16-6 record along with winning six consecutive series to enter the postseason with a 35-25 record.</p>\n<p>In 2014, although Santa Barbara did not make a regional, it posted more than 30 wins for the second straight season, making Checketts just the second head coach in program history to have back-to-back 30-plus win seasons.</p>\n<p>Finally, last year the team achieved a landmark milestone as the impact of the 2012 and 2013 recruiting classes reached their peak, and the Gauchos had arguably the best season in school history after going 40-17-1 to set a new record in most wins against a D1 schools. That season, Santa Barbara was selected to host the South region as the No. 1 seed in the 2015 NCAA Regionals for the first time in program history.</p>\n<p>Although it did not make it out of the first round last year, there is no doubt that the UCSB baseball team has the most significant piece it needs to eventually make a run at the College World Series: A head coach.</p>\n<p>Since his arrival in 2011, Checketts has made significant impact as the programs winning percentage has gone from .500 to .702. He has also played a major role in the pitching department as the programs’ career ERA has made a significant drop from 4.14 in 2012 to 2.45 in 2015.</p>\n<p>Checketts 137-87-1 overall record during his first four full years of coaching currently places him as the Gauchos’ leader in career overall winning percentage (.612) and career conference winning percentage (.556).</p>\n<p>This season the UCSB baseball team is still making noise as it again already registered more than 30 wins on the season and enjoyed the success of breaking a 30-year old school record in consecutive home wins, which is now at 17.</p>\n<p>Even with all this success, Checketts’ humble persona reminds him constantly he could not have done this without his predecessors. He also knows there is still much more work to be done.</p>\n<p>“You know I haven’t really looked up yet,” Checketts said. “We still haven’t won a championship and we still have a lot of work to do, so me and my staff just keep working hard to reach that goal. They deserve a bunch of credit because the continuity of this staff has certainly helped me grow a lot.”</p>\n<p>However, just because coach Checketts cannot truly accept all the praise he deserves, there are certainly no lack of people willing to give him said praise for all the incredible work he has done here at UCSB including his own players.</p>\n<p>“He has made me a more mature person and a better ball player,” redshirt sophomore infielder J.J. Muno said. “I knew he was a good coach, and he had an amazing staff and he was going to take this program to new places and I wanted to be apart of it.”</p>\n<p>“He always pushes me to be a better and better player and I will always be thankful for that.” sophomore first baseman Austin Bush added. “He knows how to push you to your limits and I love that.”</p>\n<p>Changing the culture at UCSB has been a successful endeavor so far but it is not over yet and Checketts is committed for the ride after signing a contract extension through 2020.</p>\n<p>“Nothing great is ever easy and instilling this culture has not been an easy thing. It has taken away time from my wife and kids but luckily I have the best wife who continues to push me,” Checketts said. “But I am dedicated to this program and passionate about Gaucho baseball and I am here for the long haul.”</p>\n<p>Certainly turning around a program is no easy feat, but it certainly is a rewarding one. To know that the time and effort put in to changing a culture has not been a waste certainly must be fulfilling if nothing else. And there is no doubt that newer recruits are seeing the culture change at Santa Barbara and want to come here to be a part of something special.</p>\n<p>Andrew Checketts has been a tremendous coach for UCSB and hopefully he stays at UCSB until he retires. With his immense dedication there is no doubt he will one day get to Omaha and hoist a National Championship for the Gauchos.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In those six games they were outscored 43-20.</p>\n<p>Being away from home is usually enough to get UCSB off its game, as it only has an 8-11-1 record; however, a close 4-3 win at UCLA this past Tuesday might have come at just the right moment so that it can go into the UCI game with some confidence.</p>\n<p>Since 2002, the Gauchos have struggled immensely against the Anteaters posting a 14-28 record. It also does not help that Santa Barbara has not won a series at UC Irvine since 1986, but will definitely look to change that this year as its playoff lives depend on it.</p>\n<p>As most of these conference series go, the home team usually holds the advantage in terms of winning, as the past has consistently shown. Last season, UCSB swept UCI at home; two of wins had only one-run differences. However, two years ago when the series was at the Anteaters’ home, they swept the Gauchos in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>UCI will rely on its batting success to get it through this series, as it currently boasts the top batting average (.280), the top on-base percentage (.363) and the second best slugging percentage (.374) in the conference.</p>\n<p>One big factor in that is sophomore Keston Hiura, who has a .382 batting average, third best in the Big West. His home runs (seven) and RBI’s (37) are also third best in the conference, while his slugging percentage (.580) is the best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s success in road games usually comes down to how the young pitching staff reacts to the pressure of the large road crowds. In their 20 road games this season, the pitching staff has allowed 91 earned runs compared to only 96 earned runs at home through 26 games.</p>\n<p>This month in particular, the inexperience and lack of depth has really shown itself, as the pitching staff has a combined 5.52 ERA, 54 earned runs and has allowed six home runs through 10 games. In the month of April, the throwing rotation had a 3.38 ERA, 53 earned runs and only four home runs allowed in 16 games.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the return of two solid pitchers from injury, redshirt junior James Carter and redshirt senior Justin Kelly, can help the struggling rotation. In his three appearances since his Tommy John surgery, Carter has been pitching five solid innings, allowing only five hits and no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>Kelly has also been solid as in 5.1 innings pitched he has allowed one run and four hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be no easy task for the Gauchos, but it certainly is necessary if they want to make a run at the postseason.
