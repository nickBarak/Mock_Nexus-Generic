Give her credit, she’s a good player, but we allowed her to get things too easy.”</p>\n<p>The loss marks the first loss to Irvine during the Carlene Mitchell rein as Santa Barbara remains winless on the road in Big West play.</p>\n<p>Following Buckley’s lead, the Anteaters outrebounded the Gauchos 43-28. They also shot 26-33 from the free throw line compared to 6-10 for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious there wasn’t an attack mentality in just the discrepancy with the free throws,” Mitchell said. “You’re not going to win on the road no matter who you’re playing if that’s the amount of times we’re sending them to the free throw line. And a lot of those free throws stem from the rebounding side of it. So, rebounding and free throws – that’s the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Similar to all season long, Santa Barbara failed to play a consistent game. The first half saw a back and forth game between UCSB and UCI until the Anteaters finished the first half on a 6-0 run to take a 38-30 halftime lead. Buckley contributed four of those six points.</p>\n<p>Then to open the second half, the Gauchos continued to fall apart. UCSB was unable to find the bottom of the net until 15:56 into the second half, allowing a 10-0 run by the Anteaters. The lead would be too large to overcome as UCSB could only play Irvine even the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>“They took it right at us and we had a turnover on the offensive end the very first possession that led to a layup on that end. It was just back to back,” Mitchell said. “It’s frustrating and our kids didn’t fight through it. You’d like them to be able to make one mistake and not let it carry over to the opposite end of the floor. It did two or three times.”</p>\n<p>With the victory, Irvine remains a perfect 5-0 at home. They improve to 10-10 overall and 3-3 in the Big West. Santa Barbara, on the other hand, drops to 6-13 overall and 1-5 in conference.</p>\n<p>“You have to be positive completely. As a team, we have to stay together and know what our strengths are,” Nesbit said. “We have to treat every game like we’re going in to win every time. It’s about being consistent and putting two halves together.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to rebound quickly as they make the long road trip north to UC Davis Saturday. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/","id":556,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[555,554,553],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Taking on the Best of the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Welcomes First Place UC Irvine to the Thunderdome Thursday Night","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After finishing a three-game road trip with a tough loss, the UCSB men’s basketball team faces a crucial test Thursday night when it hosts first-place UC Irvine at the Thunderdome.

The Gauchos will attempt to rebound from the loss when they return home, where they are 5-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>Irvine, meanwhile, had a six-game winning streak snapped when they fell to Hawaii on Saturday for its first and only conference loss so far this season.</p>\n<p>An interesting matchup to watch in this game will be UCSB junior center Alan Williams against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye. The 6’7” Williams ranks first in the Big West with 22.9 points and 10.6 rebounds, and is second in blocks at 2.4 per game. Ndiaye, however, is an imposing 7’6”, the tallest player in the nation, and leads the conference with 3.4 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>It will certainly be interesting to see how much of a defensive impact Ndiaye will have on Big Al, the seventh leading scorer in the nation.</p>\n<p>“Al will be fine against him. Al will be able to score. [Ndiaye] really affects the game, he’s huge. We’ve never played against anything like him, nobody has,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “At the same time he scores nine points a game. His biggest effect on the game is on the defensive end, he’s tremendously effective down there at taking away the rim. Al might have to hit jumpers but I think Al will find ways to be productive.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Anteaters are dangerous and versatile, ranking second in the conference averaging over 75 points per game. Senior guard Chris McNealy leads Irvine with over 12 points per game, while junior forward Will Davis II and freshman guard Luke Nelson each average just above 11 per game. Ndiaye along with sophomore guard Alex Young score above nine points per game to give the Anteaters a reliable starting five.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounds pulling down nearly 40 boards per game, while placing atop the Big West with a 48.5 field goal percentage. Ndiaye and Davis II each average just above six rebounds per game to lead the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good rebounding team, they have a plus-six average on the year rebounding-wise, which is a big number in college basketball. And that is not just Mamadou,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly will not go down without a fight, especially in front of a home crowd that has come out to support in recent games. In the last two home games, the attendance at the Thunderdome has averaged more than 4,500 fans per game.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can make this place really tough for opponents to come into. That’s our main goal: to get as many students out here as we possibly can,” Big Al said. “Every game is important when you get into conference, especially home games. You’ve got to win as many home games as you possibly can, and this one’s really important, so we’ve got to get it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the key number for the Gauchos seems to be 70. UCSB is 11-0 when they allow 70 points of fewer and 1-6 when allowing 70 or more. In order to defeat first-place Irvine, Santa Barbara will need to keep Irvine’s numerous offensive weapons in check.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will respond to Irvine with a trio of wing players who have supported Big Al from the perimeter. Brown along with sophomore guard Michael Bryson and senior guard Kyle Boswell have been impressive from three-point land this season, with the latter two each ranking in the top six in three-point percentage in the Big West. Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has helped facilitate the scoring with a conference best 5.2 assists per game and a 3.6 assist to turnover ratio which ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a good team.

Meanwhile, the Gauchos have been shifting their starters each match, as they have been trying to arrange their most efficient lineup, so the Gaucho who will be facing Mueller is yet to be determined.</p>\n<p>“We have to play on each court with toughness,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “LMU is similar to San Francisco. We have to just be more consistent, move better and we have to want it more than the other team on the court. I’m not panicking about the 0-2 start to the season; it’s a long season and the goal is for each match to help get us ready for the Big West.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara should hope that history repeats itself this Sunday as the Gauchos have beaten LMU the last three out of four meetings. The Gauchos do have a number of new teammates this year such as freshmen Melissa Baker, Kaiulani Boyer and Jaimee Gilbertson, all who look to be great additions to the women’s team.</p>\n<p>“We feel good about this Sunday’s match. I feel like these past few matches have really just been a means for us to adjust to the new atmosphere we now have as a team,” senior Kiersten Meehan said. “We have a lot of new members this year as well as people coming back from injury, which is something we never really have had to deal with before. I feel like we are getting used to these changes and becoming more of a unit and hopefully that will show against LMU.”</p>\n<p>Meehan started at number one singles for the Gauchos in their last meeting against USF. Meehan was defeated by Thyra Taune 1-6, 0-6. Yet, the women’s team looks to be in a state of repair and a win against LMU this Sunday could bring new life to the Gauchos and rejuvenate the team after an early season slump.</p>\n<p>“I think we all just need to be on the same page,” Meehan said. “We all need the same focus, same attitude and same will to win that day. It would make each of the seven matches an absolute battle for LMU to win if we are able to do this.”</p>\n<p>Games will start at 11 a.m. at the LMU Tennis Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/","id":208,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[207,206,205],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Richard Sherman on Point, Crabtree a Sore Loser","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=661%2C492&ssl=1","description":"Richard Sherman's trash talking is part of his game.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>First of all, let me begin by stating something that sometimes goes under the radar in the debate of Richard Sherman. Michael Crabtree started it. All season long, Crabtree has been talking about Sherman and about how overrated he is. He was never quite blatant about it, and most of his comments were said when few people were watching. He surely never said anything on the same stage that Sherman did. But he said it nonetheless, and it was a chip that Sherman carried on his shoulder all season long.</p>\n<p>Then after all that, Sherman still went to congratulate Crabtree on “a hell of a game”. After the final whistle, Sherman went to shake Crabtree’s hand, but his olive branch was met with a hand in the face. Crabtree might be more quiet and passive-aggressive about it, but the unsportsmanlike conduct went both ways and started with Crabtree’s “DeMarcus Cousins-esque” rejection of civility. Imagine what Crabtree would have said about Sherman if Crabtree wasn’t a loser this season.</p>\n<p>So after that, Sherman was a little fired up. He has just made the game-winning play, sending his beloved team to the Super Bowl. The adrenaline was still pumping, and Sherman’s eyes had a fierce, hungry look in them.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He had just proved all his critics wrong, yet, again, but there was still unfinished business to attend to. He wanted it to be perfectly clear to the whole world that his Seahawks were not the underdogs against anyone, including the red-hot 49ers and the mighty Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Sherman has had to defy the odds and make his statement through actions his entire career. Crabtree was a first-round draft pick, Sherman was a fifth-round pick. Crabtree is making top-ten-pick money, while Sherman is making the league minimum.</p>\n<p>Crabtree is being labeled as having the best-hands of all-time, a distinction that completely disrespects previous 49er legends such as Jerry Rice, while Sherman was still an unknown entity to NFL fans even this season. Yet Sherman has been to multiple Pro Bowls and leads the best defense in the NFL, while Crabtree is just a good player on an average offense.</p>\n<p>Even Crabtree’s after-the-fact retort was weak. After the game and the interview, Crabtree tweeted “Film don’t lie. Show me the tape where the guy is the best.” Well Mike, we could show you that tape of the final play of the game a thousand times, and you still won’t get the picture. The fact that there is no other tape besides that play is a testament to the extent of which your quarterback fears Sherman Island.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question: Who do you want on your team? Seattle fans and Sherman’s teammates alike adore their star cornerback. He has demonstrated loyalty, intensity and excellence ever since he came to Seattle, and his trash talking is funny and endearing to everyone who isn’t on the receiving end of it. Pete Carroll approves of Sherman’s aura and believes it inspires the rest of the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>Sherman backs up his trash talk on the field and is a well-spoken, respectful, interesting dude off the field. I don’t think any “thugs”, as Niner fans refer to Sherman, have graduated from Stanford with a GPA hovering around 4.0.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Sherman is the best cornerback in the game, and if his intensity and trash talking in the game are part of what makes him the best in the world, that’s just something fans must live with. The 12th man is behind Sherman every step of the way and love who he is on and off the field.</p>\n<p>While Sherman’s postgame interview might have been a little off-putting to some, it was an extreme and highly publicized moment. It was the culmination of years of adversity being overcome, expressed in the heat of the moment after a positive gesture was rejected. Crabtree needs to shut his mouth and hit the practice field if he wants to say anything about Sherman in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/","id":3250,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3249,3248,3247],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Thug is No Way to Describe Richard Sherman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=661%2C492&ssl=1","description":"Critics have been wrong to call Richard Sherman a thug.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>If you haven’t heard the name Richard Sherman, maybe it’s time you read some headlines once in a while. The talented Seattle Seahawks cornerback has emerged as one of the most popular yet polarizing figures in the game of football thanks in large part to his postgame rant after the NFC Championship game. In case you need a refresher, Sherman yelled on camera, criticizing 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree and proclaiming himself the best cornerback in the game. Within minutes, Sherman was trending on Twitter, and he immediately became a national sensation.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have received much criticism, both online and in the media, and rightfully so. His behavior showed poor sportsmanship and took away from what truly should have mattered — his teammates and the team victory. Instead, Sherman took the spotlight to belittle an opposing player who he had just trumped on national television, causing media and fans across the nation to focus more so on his antics rather than the Seahawks advancing to the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>But the way in which many have responded to Sherman is troubling and brings up an interesting and disturbing discussion. Many people, particularly online, resorted to calling Sherman a “thug,” a word with an extremely negative connotation. Is Sherman a loudmouth? Sure. Can he be described as cocky and at times arrogant? I wouldn’t argue against it. However, calling Sherman a thug and making him a villain out of a mishandled interview is certainly now way to him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sherman came from the poor neighborhood of Compton, worked hard in high school to graduate as the Salutatorian with a 4.2 GPA and received a scholarship to play football at Stanford. Once at Stanford, Sherman continued to excel, graduating with a 3.9 GPA and a degree in Communication while balancing football and a spot in the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He is also working towards a Master’s degree from Stanford.</p>\n<p>In addition to his academic excellence, Sherman is a generous and philanthropic man, often visiting underprivileged schools and providing students and athletes with the necessary resources that are often taken for granted in the classroom and on the field. Sherman even went as far as signing a contract with students, stipulating that if they were good students and members of the community, he would continue to provide them with classroom materials.</p>\n<p>A Stanford-educated man who has no criminal history and has shown a knack for helping children and the underprivileged certainly does not sound like a thug to me. Whether it is racism or even poor judgment and word choice on the behalf of critics, a thug is no way to describe Richard Sherman.</p>\n<p>His antics are over the top at times, but that, along with his talent on the field are what make him such a popular player. Sherman is the only defensive player in the top-10 of NFL jersey sales, and those numbers have skyrocketed in the past month.</p>\n<p>As far as his claim to be the best cornerback in the game — I’d have to agree with Sherman. The last two years he has been named All-Pro first team, registering eight interceptions in each season, a league high this year. In only three seasons of play, Sherman has registered 20 career interceptions. Not bad for a player who switched from wide receiver to cornerback in his final year at Stanford.</p>\n<p>A fifth round pick in the NFL draft by Seattle, Sherman has excelled in life every step of the way in the face of tremendous opposition. If you’ve ever heard him speak, aside from the notorious NFC Championship Game interview, you’d know Sherman is an intelligent and well-spoken man.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have certainly garnered him more haters, but with that come more and more fans as well. When examining Sherman for the man he is on and off the field, and not only judging him on the one instance of poor behavior, it is hard to justify the hate. I am surprised to admit to myself that I am a Richard Sherman fan, something I never thought I’d say.</p>\n<p>You can be sure he’ll be in the spotlight come Sunday and all eyes will be on him and his actions during and after the game. Sherman is no villain, just a fiery competitor. Best of luck to you, Richard, this Super Bowl Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/","id":3249,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3248,3247,3246],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Fullerton at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs-PETER-VANBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs-PETER-VANBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB gave up a lead to Fullerton, falling to the Titans at home for the first time since 1991.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Cal State Fullerton guard Chante Miles wasn’t her team’s leading scorer Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>She even finished the game three points below her season average, but in the critical moments, she showed up in a big way.</p>\n<p>Despite taking a 10-point lead into halftime, the UCSB women’s basketball team found itself up just four with a little under eight minutes to go in the second half.

She’s such a great ball handler. There were a couple times we gambled in the backcourt, and she made us pay by attacking and getting to the rim.”</p>\n<p>After UCSB regained the lead, taking a slight 55-52 advantage, Miles converted a layup in transition and earned the foul, completing the three-point play to tie the game with 3:27 remaining.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Miles drove into the lane and dished the ball to junior forward Kathleen Iwuoha for the layup, giving the Titans a three-point lead.</p>\n<p>Finally, after Santa Barbara missed a jumper to bring the game within one with 24 seconds to go, Miles was fouled and hit the two clutch free throws to ice the game. She finished the afternoon with 11 points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, it’s hard to guard a great player like that one-on-one,” Mitchell said. “That’s not what our defense revolves around, so it was probably the rotation in why she was able to attack and get a couple and-ones.”</p>\n<p>After winning 40 consecutive games against the Titans, UCSB has now dropped the last two. Saturday’s win in the Thunderdome marks the first win in Santa Barbara for Fullerton since 1991 as the Titans improve to 7-11 overall and 3-2 in the Big West. The Gauchos drop to 6-12 overall and 1-4 in conference.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB struggled with consistency. After holding the Titans to 23 first half points and 29.2 percent shooting from the field, the Gauchos allowed Fullerton 44 second half points.</p>\n<p>“It’s disappointing because that first half was the style of play we’ve been waiting on the defensive side of things,” Mitchell said. “The game of basketball is two halves, and they made us pay for all of our mistakes in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Five players finished in double-figures for the Titans, and the team hit an incredible 10 shots from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“When you’re making threes and everybody’s feeling it, you get in a certain type of rhythm,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “It gathers momentum for the team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also featured three players in double-figures with senior guard Melissa Zornig leading the Gaucho offense with 20 points. Mason added 18 points and a team-high eight rebounds while Onome Jemerigbe added a career-high 11 points.</p>\n<p>The loss concludes a three-game homestand for Santa Barbara. Next week, the Gauchos go on road, facing UC Irvine and UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53705\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53705\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/","id":552,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[551,550,549],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 16 UCSB Opens Season at Winter Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6-peter-vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6-peter-vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB opened the season with a 2-5 record at the UCSB Winter Invitational this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Kicking its season off as the hosts for the UCSB Winter Invite, the No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team began its year with a 2-5 start this past weekend.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos’ solid start to the year quickly turned into a tough five game losing streak, their opening weekend finale against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps proved to be their best performance thus far.

After the Bears got out to a quick 4-0 lead after the first quarter, sophomore utility Samantha Murphy scored the Gauchos’ first goal of the game to cut the lead to three. However, the Bears answered back with four more consecutive goals heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>Going into the third quarter with a large deficit, sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson gave the Gauchos their second goal of the match. Cal answered with three goals of its own, taking a dominant 11-2 lead into the final period. Junior utility Lauren Martin was one of the few bright spots for UCSB during the game, scoring two goals in the fourth quarter, but the Gauchos were outplayed once again and finally fell 14-4.</p>\n<p>Playing No. 5 Arizona State early on Saturday, Santa Barbara came out strong with Martin scoring the game’s opening goal. The Sun Devils answered with three goals of their own, but freshman attacker Carly Christian scored two straight before the end of the first period, making it a one-goal deficit at 4-3 heading into the second.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos again started the second quarter strong as Hudson scored first to tie it at four goals apiece, but Arizona State began to pull away with another three consecutive scores heading into the half.</p>\n<p>In the second half, UCSB found goals from freshman attacker Jenna Solberg and Murphy, but the team was unable to pull off the comeback and lost 11-6 for its second-straight loss.</p>\n<p>Against No. 8 San Jose State Friday afternoon, the Gauchos’ offense got off to a slow start. UCSB was shutout in the first quarter but its strong defense kept them in the game by giving up only one goal.</p>\n<p>Just after the second quarter began, Hudson tied the game at 1-1. As they did multiple times over the weekend, though, the Gauchos gave up three consecutive goals to the Spartans and went into the half trailing 4-1.</p>\n<p>To have any shot at coming back, UCSB needed a big second half, and it got one. Martin scored two goals, including one coming off of a set, and Christian added another to give the Gauchos three in the quarter and head into the fourth trailing 6-4.</p>\n<p>In a tightly contested fourth quarter, UCSB took the game down to the wire. Hudson scored her second goal, and Martin scored two more to bring her total to four on the day. Still trailing 8-7, Christian tied the game.</p>\n<p>However, with just 1:11 remaining, San Jose State was able to beat sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw and come away with a 9-8 victory. Brokaw ended the game with eight saves.</p>\n<p>In their first game of the season, the Gauchos were brought down to earth quickly as they gave up a goal just 15 seconds into the match. Sophomore utility Jessie Porter answered back to tie it at one and Christian scored her first career goal to give her team the lead.</p>\n<p>Before the end of the half, Christian contributed her second goal of the match while sophomore utility Michelle Dunn and freshman utility Megan Linder also scored to give UCSB a 5-3 lead at the half. In the third, Martin scored once more to make it 6-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to hold on in a low-scoring fourth quarter, ending the game with a 7-6 win and their first of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB gets next weekend off before heading on the road for the UCSD Triton Invite on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/","id":5086,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5085,5084,5083],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Road Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-9-peter-vanndenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-9-peter-vanndenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated Riverside Thursday night before falling to Cal State Fullerton in a televised contest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The ability to close out games has become an area of concern for the UCSB men’s basketball team as the Gauchos finished this weekend with a 1-1 mark.

With a chance to give the Highlanders a late-game lead, Johns made the first free throw but missed the second, avoiding what could have been an epic collapse for UCSB.</p>\n<p>In the overtime period, six of the eight points UCSB scored came by the way of free throws. Bryson scored the final four points of the game for Santa Barbara, an impressive feat considering he had all of one point scored in regulation.</p>\n<p>With a chance to tie the game, Riverside freshman guard Sam Finley missed a three-point jumper with one second remaining to secure the 68-65 win for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Big Al led UCSB with 21 points and seven rebounds, while Harmon and sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added 11 points. Boswell added 10 points off the bench for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Chris Patton led Riverside with 23 points behind an impressive 10-13 night shooting. Finley added 20 points and Johns pitched in with nine points and 11 rebounds for the Highlanders. Including a Saturday victory over Cal Poly, Riverside now holds a 7-13 record and a 2-4 mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces UC Irvine Thursday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January 27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/","id":551,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[550,549,548],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Defending Champions","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-1-PETER-VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.UCI-1-PETER-VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has dropped its last two matches after starting the season with three consecutive victories.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team closed out a tough week with a second loss against No. 8 UC Irvine in Saturday night’s game.

Not only did Santa Barbara come out flat from the service line, but weak blocking at the net and multiple attack errors were no competition for UCI’s exceptional level of play.</p>\n<p>“What it comes down to is playing aggressive. For us we need to make sure our guys are playing aggressive and playing to win,” Tyson said. “As long as we are doing that, we have our shot, no matter how good their service is.”</p>\n<p>The Anteaters scored an impressive 11 service aces in Saturday’s game, nine of which came from the first two sets.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos performance in the third mirrored a similar comeback situation that happened in the Stanford match a few weeks earlier when UCSB came back to win. Dominant blocking at the net from sophomore setter Jonah Seif and redshirt junior middle blocker Jake Staahl, in combination with nine UCI errors, led to a strong nine-point Gaucho victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB continued this momentum into the fourth set. Junior outside hitter Austin Kingi was a large contributor to the Gauchos late game offensive push, finishing with a team high of 17 kills.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Irvine came out aggressive in the final set, leading into what would ultimately come down to a blocking game. Redshirt junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen and Staahl had a combined block that tied the match at 4-4. Staahl and Seif followed with another, giving the Gauchos a one-point advantage. UC Irvine responded with two blocks of their own, making the match an even tie.</p>\n<p>“It was pretty amazing how we were able to come back from being two down, and eventually have match point,” senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson said. “We were blocking pretty well at that point.”</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the final set UCI held a 12-10 lead before UCSB scored four straight and had match point at 14-12. Two consecutive Gaucho errors kept Irvine in the game. After tying it up at 14-14, two kills from UCI junior opposite Zack La Cavera and a final Irvine block sealed the match with an Anteater victory of 3-2.</p>\n<p>“In the end, hitting two balls out was really frustrating, especially when we knew we had the game in our hands,” Thompson said.</p>\n<p>Despite their late game rally, the Gauchos couldn’t pull the win after another slow start.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine improves to 5-4 overall and advances to 2-3 in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>This week UCSB will host the Hawai’i Rainbow Warriors in a doubleheader on Thursday and Friday night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January 27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53717\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-defending-champions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53717\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-defending-champions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-defending-champions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-defending-champions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-defending-champions/","id":5267,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5266,5265,5264],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Second Consecutive Match to Open Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/w-tennnis-PETER-VANdenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/w-tennnis-PETER-VANdenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to 0-2 this season after losing to the University of San Francisco.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team looked to obtain its first win of the season in its season opener Sunday, but fell to University of San Francisco 7-0 at the Recreational Center Tennis courts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fall to 0-2 on the season while USF remains undefeated at 4-0.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was looking to rebound after their 7-0 season opening loss to UCLA last week, but were unsuccessful against San Francisco Sunday.

Tuane’s powerful serve and accurate backhand led to the quick defeat of Meeham 1-6, 0-6. Meeham, however, was dealing with a sore shoulder and quickly had it on ice after the game. This noticeably affected her match, as she was unable to put optimal force throughout her game when it came to serves and forehand hits.</p>\n<p>Scatliffe faced USF sophomore Sophia Holmberg in the second singles, which was a relatively close match in the first set, but slipped away from her in the second set as Holmberg out-played Scatliffe 3-6, 2-6.</p>\n<p>Third singles starter freshman Jaimee Gilberston lost in a close contest to USF sophomore Andrea Ka, losing in a tiebreaker. Fourth singles starter junior Stacy Yam then lost to USF junior Marina Nikolic. Fifth singles starter junior Paola Cos was defeated by USF junior Milica Hadzi-Tanovic and sixth singles starter freshman Melissa Baker fell to USF sophomore Brooke Irish.</p>\n<p>“We really just need to play better from start to finish, but there were glimpses of goodness from here and there where we felt confident,” Thibodeau said. “We still have some work to do, but we aren’t far. I’m glad it’s still early in the season, and we are just going to keep getting better, so I’m not too worried about the 0-2 start.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have not hit conference play yet, so the 0-2 start does not have a huge impact on them at this point in the season. The women’s team looks to bounce back and gain their first win of the season in their next match at Loyola Marymount this Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The team has lost eight of its last nine, with its last victory dating back to almost a month ago when UCSB defeated Seattle Dec. 28.</p>\n<p>“I think we all know our potential, so it’s frustrating, but at the same time, we’re staying positive,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “There’s still a lot of season left. As long as we all stay positive and stay on the same page, I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>One of two teams still winless in conference, the Gauchos need to make a run quickly in the ultra-competitive Big West this year.</p>\n<p>The other team still chasing its first conference victory is Riverside. The Highlanders are also extremely hungry for a victory having lost 10 consecutive games. They enter the Thunderdome with a 4-13 overall and a 0-4 Big West mark.</p>\n<p>“We’re both backed in the corner as far as our record and Big West standings,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “There’s no panic, but there is a sense of urgency. We just need to take care of business at home the next two games, and we’ll be at the same record we started out at this point last year. We know what to do. It’s just a matter of buckling down and getting it done.”</p>\n<p>One fatal flaw for UCSB in Big West contests so far has been falling behind by large margins and needing to play catch up late in the game.</p>\n<p>“There’s no reason for us to dig ourselves holes like that,” Mitchell said. “This team is a little uncomfortable with who to go to and through when we need a basket, so everyone puts themselves on an island and tries to do it on their own. You can never do that. It takes five players on the court, so they need to learn to trust each other.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ offense is plenty capable of scoring, ranking first in the Big West in field-goal percentage the majority of the year, Santa Barbara knows that defense is what wins it games and that they must return to their defensive prowess from previous years. Right now, UCSB ranks fifth in scoring defense, giving up 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Opening up conference, we knew we had to write it across our chest as being a defensive team first,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “That will lead to offense and transition baskets, but it has to start with defense. We know that.”</p>\n<p>Commanding the attention of any defense in the conference is sophomore guard Brittany Crain. Crain leads the Hinglanders in virtually every category, but also tops the Big West in scoring with 19.7 points per game, including 22.0 points during conference play. She also ranks first in conference in steals with 2.1 per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to stick to fundamental defense, just really bother her,” Nesbit said. “You try to make her job difficult and contest her shots and stay in front of her.”</p>\n<p>However, the Highlanders do feature four players averaging double-figures. One player that the Gauchos will keep an eye on is senior center Natasha Hadley. The only senior on the squad, Hadley has given Santa Barbara trouble in the past as she was Riverside’s leading scorer against UCSB in both matchups last year, averaging 17.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We have to get it done on the defensive end,” Zornig said. “It’s obvious we can score. Our offense is fine this year. But on the defensive end we’ve been struggling, so if we focus on that, we should be fine.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53667\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53667\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/","id":580,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[579,578,577],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seek First Win of the New Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB hosts San Francisco","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team looks to host its home opener this Sunday against San Francisco.

Our third freshman Kai [Kaiulani] Boyer is just getting back from an injury and we are really looking forward to her to add her skill and competitiveness,” said Scatliffe.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face San Francisco on its home turf this Sunday.

Closing games is big for us, so if we clean that up a little bit we definitely feel confident for Riverside and Fullerton this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has won its two most recent games after dropping the conference opener to Cal Poly, rebounding with a home victory over Long Beach State before a road victory at Cal State Northridge, the first game of the Gauchos’ three-game road trip.</p>\n<p>In last week’s victories, sophomore guard Michael Bryson shot an incredible 12-16 while garnering his second Big West Player of the Week honor this season.</p>\n<p>“It feels great [to be honored]. We got two big wins that were really necessary for us to get after losing to Cal Poly,” Bryson said. “Me being able to be a part of those wins was definitely great.”</p>\n<p>Bryson’s play was pivotal to the Gauchos’ success last week, as leading scorer Alan Williams was limited to an average of 14 points in the two contests. The junior center leads UCSB and the Big West with 22.8 points per game, good for fifth in the entire nation.</p>\n<p>Big Al also ranks sixth in the nation with 11 rebounds per game and is second in the Big West at 2.4 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“We want other guys to step up. We saw the problem when it was just Al in a game where everybody else just couldn’t seem to get it going,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “It’s a group conversation about how we need to get other people involved, we need other people to step up, make plays, be aggressive, and I think we did a much better job of that the last two games.”</p>\n<p>When scouting Riverside, Big Al and the rest of the UCSB big men will certainly face a tough matchup against sophomore Taylor Johns. The 6’7” forward leads Riverside in points at 12.8 per game while ranking third in the conference in rebounds (8.2) and blocks per game (1.9).</p>\n<p>“I make it a mission to stop whoever I’m matched up against,” Brewe said. “If I am matched up against Riverside’s big guy, it’s going to be my personal mission. I know it’s Al’s mission and Sam’s mission to really stop him and keep him contained. That’s going to be part of the game plan, and we feel like we have the physical presence and the ability to do so.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have lost four of their last five games, the lone victory being an 81-69 comeback win over UC Davis. UCSB split the season series with Riverside last season with each team winning on its home floor.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’re not going to overlook them. We need to be edgy, and we’ve already lost a home game — that puts you in a little bit of a hole,” Coach Williams said. “We need to win as many road contests as possible. You want to be in the championship hunt, it’s about how many road games can you win, and we need to make sure we take advantage of any opportunity we have on the road.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton, meanwhile, has also lost four of its last five contests with the only victory coming in a 78-73 home contest against Riverside. The Gauchos also split last year’s contest against the Titans, winning at home and falling on the road.</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Riverside on Thursday is scheduled for 7 p.m., while Saturday’s contest at Fullerton is set for a 7:30 p.m. start on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/","id":554,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[553,552,551],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Conference Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB defeats UC Riverside 74-61 at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be early in the season, but the UCSB women’s basketball team could not afford another loss.</p>\n<p>Going into last night’s game against UC Riverside, the Gauchos were 0-3 in the Big West and had lost eight of their last nine.

Riverside, on the other hand, remains the lone winless team in league at 0-5 and 4-14 overall.</p>\n<p>After struggling to start league, averaging just 9.3 points in Santa Barbara’s first three league matches compared to 18.2 points per game during the preseason, senior guard Nicole Nesbit returned to her typical offensive force. She led Santa Barbara with 20 points, six rebounds and four assists with eight of her points coming during a game-deciding 12-0 run for the Gauchos in the second half.</p>\n<p>Zornig also stepped up for UCSB, tallying 16 points, including eight straight points for the Gauchos down the stretch to seal the game.</p>\n<p>However, unlike most games, the Gauchos received offensive production from more than just its seniors. Jasmine ware added 12 points and 11 rebounds, her first career double-double, while junior center Clair Watkins and freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe added eight and seven points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I’d say it’s about time,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said of Ware’s effort. “I understand the expectations when Jasmine came in here were the same as Clair; everyone thinks it’s supposed to be instant and sometimes it’s a process for kids. We always knew. Jas has great athletic ability and a knack for rebounding. Tonight she stepped up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded Riverside 55-30, including 21-6 on the offensive boards, which led to 23 second-chance points. The Gauchos also outscored the Highlanders 34-6 in the paint.</p>\n<p>“In practice we constantly go over rebounding drills over and over, so I think just taking the drills that we do in practice and moving it to the game is what it’s about,” Ware said.</p>\n<p>After missing a multitude of easy layups throughout the first half, Santa Barbara found its offensive stride in the second half. Down 51-50 with just over 17 minutes remaining, Nesbit completed a three point play to spark a 12-0 run for UCSB. Nesbit earned two three point plays during the spurt.</p>\n<p>“Nic’s a gamer and she knows she’s going to get most team’s best defender on her most nights, but she has the ability to score in multiple ways and she found her legs tonight,” Mitchell said. “Her teammates have confidence in her as well as the coaching staff.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Riverside crept back into the game, going on a 6-0 run to decrease the margin to just five points. For the Gauchos, another senior responded, with Zornig dropping eight straight points to keep the Highlanders at bay and seal the victory.</p>\n<p>For Riverside, Brittany Crain continued her offensive dominance in the Big West, scoring 19 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will finish its three game homestand tomorrow when it hosts Cal State Fullerton. Tip-off is set for 7.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-earn-first-conference-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-earn-first-conference-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-earn-first-conference-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-earn-first-conference-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-earn-first-conference-victory/","id":550,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[549,548,547],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Season With Loss to UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-tennis-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-tennis-file-photo.jpg?resize=682%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB opened the 2013 season with a tough loss to UCLA.

The number one doubles match saw sophomore Catherine Harrison / sophomore Kyle McPhillips of UCLA defeat senior Kiersten Meehan / Scatliffe of UCSB 6-1. The Gauchos came to play against the Bruins, but the skill level just did not add up for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a team, we have been trying to improve our aggressiveness and focus during important points for our matches. We have been doing a lot of specific point play during practice which require a certain amount of shots to be hit in a specific area, which helps with our focus and shot selection tremendously,” Scatliffe said. “We also do drills that are high in intensity and encourage little or no errors for an extended amount of playing time.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos start the season with a loss, they look to bounce back with their home opener this Sunday against San Francisco. The match is set to begin at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/","id":662,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[661,660,659],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":136,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
