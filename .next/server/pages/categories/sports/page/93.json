Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>By securing the sixth seed with a win over Pepperdine this past weekend, the No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team’s quest for its first MPSF Championship in school history begins with a match against No. 2 Cal on Friday.</p>\n<p>“I though defensively we played well.” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We are really excited for this up-coming game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently riding a two-game winning streak with an overall record of 16-9 and finished conference play with a 5-5 record. Cal, the third seed in the tournament, has won five of its last six matches and holds a 21-5 record finishing MPSF play with a 7-2 record. The Golden Bears are seeking their first MPSF championship since 2006.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The quarterfinal match this Friday will be the fourth meeting between these two teams this season. The Bears have defeated the Gauchos in the last three matches by scores of: 12-5, 12-5 and 12-8.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been going over the last three matches on film.” Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge said. “We are really confident we can win.”</p>\n<p>In the last matchup at Campus Pool, UCSB had a chance to pull off the upset against then No. 4 Cal when they were tied 8-8 after the third. In the final frame, Santa Barbara was held scoreless and gave up four goals in its third loss to Cal this season.</p>\n<p>“We improved in each game we played them this year.” Wigo said. “The last game was our best performance, went tied into the third. I think we can do that again and this time we will finish.”</p>\n<p>The Golden Bears are led by two top-10 MPSF scorers in freshman attacker Johnny Hooper and freshman utility Odysseas Masmanidis. Hooper is the third leading scorer in MPSF with 65 goals while Masmanidis ranks seventh with 56 goals this season. The two freshman have combined for 15 goals against the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB must also be weary of Colin Mulcahy, the Sept. 7 KAP7/MPSF Player of the Week recipient. The senior attacker has scored 47 goals on the season, third most on the team, including a five goal performance this past weekend against Stanford. He has accounted for five goals in three matches against Santa Barbara this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to be ready defensively.” Wigo said. “They are a tough team and they are talented.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Golden Bears are led by junior goalkeeper Lazar Andric who has tallied 210 saves this season and has an impressive 10.2 saves per game. He holds the fourth highest saves total in a single match this season when he has 19 against Pacific on Oct. 10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will want another big performance from star senior Derek Shoemaker who has been on a hot streak recently with seven goals in the last two matches. The attacker leads the team with 42 goals.</p>\n<p>Right behind him is sophomore Shane Hauschild who has 35 goals on the season, good for second on the team. Other key factors are freshman Boris Jovanovic who has 26 goals this year and junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton who has scored at least two goals in the last two matches.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the pool, UCSB knows it has one of the best goalkeepers in MPSF history, senior Chris Whitelegge. Whitelegge is currently at 850 career saves which is only five saves from the No. 3 spot and 39 saves from No. 2. However, Whitelegge has struggled against Cal allowing 12 goals in each of the last three matches.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Gauchos will go as far as their star seniors take them. The seniors have played a big role all season whether it be offensively, defensively or in the leadership roles. Intensity will also be a big key to the game, as UCSB will need to take the game to Cal instead of the other way around. Most importantly, the intensity needs to last four quarters to in order to pull off the upset.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face off against Cal in the quarterfinals of the MPSF Tournament on Friday, Nov. 20 at USC’s Uytengsu Aquatic Center at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Golden Bears are 2-0 after picking up their second straight blowout victory to open the season, outscoring their opponents by an average of 25 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We have a tough preseason schedule every year. It’s all about building,” sophomore guard Gabe Vincent said. “We played a much better game than we did at UNO and now we’re looking to play better than we did at Cal. There’s a lot of things we’ve got to work on and shooting might be one piece but we have a lot defensively to work on as well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off a season-opener in which UCSB shot just 34.9 percent from the field, things weren’t much better to open the game at Cal as the Gauchos missed their first seven shots before center Ami Lakoju’s got them on the board at the 14:38 mark, already trailing 8-0 prior to the freshman’s layup.</p>\n<p>Berkeley’s junior guard Jordan Mathews came out hot, knocking down a pair of triples and converting a three-point play during the Bears 13-2 run to open the game. He went on to finish with 16 points and seven rebounds while going 3-6 from deep and 6-9 from the field.</p>\n<p>From there, senior guard Tyrone Wallace took over as he led Cal with a 15-point first half, including 8-9 shooting from the free throw line to give his team a 47-28 lead heading into the break. The Bears shot 50 percent in the half compared to just 32.3 percent for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior guard John Green was miscredited with a third personal foul in the first stanza, causing him to play only nine minutes before the foul was reversed in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a much better effort in the final 20 minutes, outscoring Berkeley 39-38 on 14-29 shooting as a team, but the end result was never in question.</p>\n<p>One bright spot for UCSB was the play of senior guard Michael Bryson, who played his first game of the season. The Gauchos’ leading returning scorer and rebounder scored 23 points on 8-18 from the field and an impressive 4-8 from three to lead his team on offense.</p>\n<p>Wallace finished with game-highs of 24 points and six assists on an efficient 6-10 shooting night and 11-13 from the line to lead Cal. Freshman forward Jaylen Brown scored in double-digits for the second consecutive game, recording 17 points to go along with seven boards.</p>\n<p>UCSB now shifts its focus to Saturday’s game against Oregon State. With two impressive 20-point wins in their first two games, the Beavers are currently 2-0 and will play Rice later tonight.</p>\n<p>“We need to get stops,” Vincent said. “The more we can keep them out of the paint and off the free throw line like the other two teams we’ve played have been, the better off we’ll be and we can get out, run more and get more possessions.”</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Drew Eubanks has shot a remarkable 13-15 from the field through his first two career NCAA games, averaging a team-high 16 points a night. The Beavers have a total of five players averaging double-figures to start the year, including two off the bench, and are shooting a solid 49.6 percent as a team.</p>\n<p>Reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton II, son of NBA great Gary Payton, is another player shooting lights out at 55 percent. He averages 14 points and a team-leading 5.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to handle them just like we do everybody else,” Vincent said. “We’re going to play them straight up, keep them off the line and keep them out of the paint, make them shoot over us instead of around us.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, John Green has continued to show his growth coming off his first full season without missing significant time due to injury. He is currently second on the team averaging 17 points a night but has also been extremely helpful on the boards, pulling in a team-best nine per outing.</p>\n<p>Vincent is the team’s third leading-scorer at 10.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first home game of the season will be played early at 2 p.m. this Saturday against Oregon State in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/","id":400,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[399,398,397],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Competitive Edge Translated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Her life has revolved around volleyball for a vast majority of her life, but that hasn't stopped Emilia Petrachi from outperforming opponents in other forms of competition as well.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66599\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1516152861\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66598\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66599\" data-attachment-id=\"66599\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/eric_swenson_nexus_womens_vball_9-11_vs_smu_cropped_005-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Eric Swenson\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Emilia Petrachi shifts her weight in preparation for a hard outside hit straight to her.

While Petrachi played well at the high school level, she excelled at the club platform, playing for Liu Jo (LJ) Volley. Petrachi joined the club in 2013 and was placed on its Series A2 team.</p>\n<p>The decision to place her on the secondary team did not persist as her talent prompted her promotion to the Series A1 team in August 2013, making her the youngest member of the club for the remainder of the year and the following 2014-15 season. Petrachi’s addition to the club’s premier team was justified by her winning of the region’s Best Libero award in 2014.</p>\n<p>Her performance on the court exceeded the expectation that she would have a developmental role on the team, but being the club’s youngest member was overwhelming at times, as she wasn’t the only elite talent on the court anymore.</p>\n<p>“Being the youngest was hard because I needed to catch up with the experience of the others,” Petrachi said. “There were people that were 35 years old, 20 years old and myself as the youngest. But it for sure helped my growth as a volleyball player and person.”</p>\n<p>At the pinnacle of her volleyball career, Petrachi possessed veteran talent, but as a youth she was dealing with the responsibilities and pressures of playing school and club volleyball.</p>\n<p>While she was a vital asset to her high school’s volleyball team, Petrachi discovered a balancing component to her performance on the court that offered a unique twist to her identity as a competitor.</p>\n<p>This three-round translation competition is known as the Certamen Carolinum, testing students on their ability to translate Ancient Greek and Latin. It’s a form of competition that is reminiscent of a spelling bee, but with a foreign pizzazz that makes it just a tad bit more intriguing.</p>\n<p>Once introduced, it became the newest task that Petrachi was determined to conquer.</p>\n<p>Her fear of failure proved unfit for a competitor of her caliber. While learning a multitude of languages is common and tends to be innate within the European culture, Petrachi’s trouncing of the competition was unforeseen as she became a three-time winner.</p>\n<p>She won the translation competition twice in Latin and once in Ancient Greek, two languages that are convergent of her native language of Italian.</p>\n<p>“I like competition — I like to be the best in everything that I do,” Petrachi said. “It came naturally because I liked it and I wanted to be the best.”</p>\n<p>Although a well-known individual for her play on the court, it wasn’t Petrachi’s notoriety as a libero which earned her the opportunity to participate in the competition. In addition to being selected by a former high school teacher, her merits in the classroom and pure enjoyment for the competition led to her continued involvement.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t feel the pressure,” Petrachi said. “I competed really loosely, without the fear of losing.”</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s offering of courses in translation studies, no competition similar to the Certamen Carolinum exists. Although her schedule as a student-athlete wouldn’t permit time to create a rendition of the competition on campus, Petrachi remains confident with her translation abilities.</p>\n<p>“If there will ever be a competition, I will be ready to attend it,” she jokingly said.</p>\n<p>The story of a student-athlete succeeding off the court in an activity such as a translation competition may be striking for many, but it is Petrachi’s method in her decision to attend UCSB that is even more shocking, making her UCSB’s first international athlete in nearly 15 years.</p>\n<p>The college recruiting process is an exhausting experience for student-athletes — coaches calling at all times of the day with recruiting pitches, university visits, expectations of friends and family and the pressure of deciding where to dedicate the next four years of their life are all influences that help determine athletes’ future collegiate careers.</p>\n<p>For some prospects, their sights have always been focused on a dream college and are fulfilled with a scholarship offer. In today’s generation of sports, in which middle schoolers end up on high school teams and off seasons are submerged in training, young athletes in their pre-teens even receive offers from universities.</p>\n<p>However, the stresses of the recruiting process do not always follow suit. Guiding Petrachi’s decision to attend UCSB was a rare approach: intuition.</p>\n<p>Petrachi had never been to California. Visits to New York and Jacksonville, Florida served as her introductions to the American lifestyle. Still, this time could not make up for a lifetime in another country.</p>\n<p>Unlike most students, who are able to seek comfort from their families just hours away, Petrachi’s busy schedule also doesn’t permit the time for traveling the 5,000-plus mile distance that separates her and family in Italy.</p>\n<p>“It’s been tough because it’s a completely different world,” Petrachi said. “I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t visit the campus or meet the coaches before coming here.”</p>\n<p>One Skype conversation with the team and personal research of the university were her only ideas of life in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Despite her unfamiliarity with the city, new team and coaching staff prior to the start of the season, Petrachi’s decision to attend UCSB didn’t solely revolve around her future in volleyball.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to a place where I would feel good even if I wasn’t playing volleyball,” she said. “I know volleyball can be upsetting at times. I needed a place in which I could shake off the homesickness. It’s [UCSB] right on the beach, I.V. is a little community, and it’s great and I’m happy.”</p>\n<p>Enjoying her new journey as a Gaucho, Petrachi’s first-year with the UCSB women’s volleyball team has been impressive despite the team’s struggles this season.</p>\n<p>Her overall average of 4.73 digs per set ranks second in the Big West Conference while she ranks third overall in the conference with 407 total digs. Petrachi is just one of three players in the Big West to break the 400 mark this season and recently earned her second Freshman Player of the Week award on Monday.</p>\n<p>She is 88 digs away from reaching former Gaucho Leah Sully’s single-season record of 495 digs, which ranks 10th all-time in program history.</p>\n<p>“It’s been an honor to become the libero for this team,” Petrachi said. “I try to give the best that I have. I want to be in the top five because I know that I can be in there. It’s an honor that I owe to the team.”</p>\n<p>Trusting her instincts to guide her future, Petrachi knows that UCSB is the right place for her and is appreciative of Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch for the opportunity to play on her team.</p>\n<p>“She went beyond the role of being a coach,” said Petrachi. “She helped me with integrating with the girls, making me meet people and ask questions. I’d probably be lost without her.”</p>\n<p>At 7-18 overall, 3-11 in conference play and with two matches remaining this season, UCSB is still young and will have to find a way to fill in the void of losing five seniors at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>But the future is promising for UCSB, especially with the tremendous talent and competitiveness that Petrachi has to offer.</p>\n<p>A gut feeling suggests that Petrachi will be the centerpiece in helping translate the Gauchos’ upside for the future.</p>\n<p>For more information on the Certamen Corlinum translation competition, visit its official website: www.certamencarolinum.de</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66598\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66598\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/","id":1993,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1992,1991,1990],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Searching for Upset of No. 8 Hawai’i on Senior Night, Will Face UCI to Close Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos close out their season with a pair of matches this weekend including their home season finale against Hawaii.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the first time in program history, the UCSB women’s volleyball team will finish a season without double-figure wins.

Just to play as hard as we can and have fun.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will end its season on the road, facing UC Irvine next Tuesday. After being swept by Hawaii, the Anteaters are 12-14 overall, 6-8 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began its conference schedule against Hawaii which resulted in a 3-0 sweep of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With its sweep of UC Irvine on Tuesday, the Rainbow Wahine clinched the Big West Conference title outright. Hawaii is currently the only Big West team with an undefeated conference record at 13-0 and is 23-1 overall.</p>\n<p>Its third conference title in the past four years, Hawaii earned its eighth Big West and 24th overall conference title. Since its 3-1 loss to No. 11 UCLA on Sept. 6, Hawaii has been the epitome of a championship caliber team. The Rainbow Wahine currently possess a 18-match winning streak, their longest since winning 19 straight in 2012.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s success this season is no coincidence as it has been one of the best defensive teams in the country. The Rainbow Wahine led the nation in blocks per set with a 3.37 average. Continuously stifling offenses, Hawaii’s .143 opponent hitting percentage ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>With statistical rankings atop the nation, it’s no coincidence that Hawaii has dominated nearly every statistical category within the Big West.</p>\n<p>Conference leads in hitting percentage (.287), blocks (3.37), kills per set (14.05), service aces per set (1.52) and opponent hitting percentage (.143). A total of three Hawaii players rank within the top five statistical leaders in hitting percentage, blocks per set and services aces per set.</p>\n<p>While no team revolves around one individual, junior opposite Nikki Taylor has been the Rainbow Wahine’s best player.</p>\n<p>The fourth player in Hawaii history to earn four Big West Player of the Week honors, the reigning conference Offensive Player of the Week has registered at least 20 kills in three of the team’s last four matches. Her averages of 4.36 kills per set and 0.44 service aces per set lead the conference while she ranks third in blocks per set with a 1.24 average.</p>\n<p>Although the odds do not favor UCSB, the combination of playing on its home court and motivation from the occasion give the Gauchos a chance to compete versus the Big West’s best.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be aggressive,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’re going to have a big size disadvantage against Hawaii but we still have to find a way to use that to our advantage. Making sure that we get our hands on the block and that there’s no tentativeness in our play.”</p>\n<p>Helping establish UCSB’s aggressiveness is freshman libero Emilia Petrachi. Due to UCSB’s lack of size, the Gauchos’ front row defense may not earn many blocks, leaving many dig opportunities for Petrachi. She recently earned her second Big West Freshman of the Week award after 20-plus back-to-back dig performances last weekend.</p>\n<p>Another chance to avenge a loss in the first meeting presents itself in the Gauchos’ rematch against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite Santa Barbara tying the match 1-1 after two sets, the Anteaters managed to earn a 3-1 victory. Close finishes in the final two sets, back-to-back 25-23 set victories, allowed UCI to edge UCSB for the win.</p>\n<p>“The Irvine match was very recent,” Lantagne Welch said. “We had three two-point sets with them. All we needed was a point here and a point there, and that match is a different story.”</p>\n<p>It was expected that freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha, the team’s leader in kills (318), would be the leading force in Irvine’s attack against the Gauchos. However, redshirt senior outside hitter Marisa Bubica carried the Anteaters to victory with a match-high 19 kills and finished with a .341 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Wins to end the season would be an encouraging finish for a team that has struggled to meet its expectations. But as the collegiate careers of five seniors come to an end, the journey of the players is most rewarding.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big deal,” Lantagne Welch said. “Seniors grow and progress throughout their careers. It’s a special moment, seeing them come along not only as volleyball players but people.”</p>\n<p>The Senior Night matchup versus Hawaii will begin at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 21 in the Thunderdome. UCSB’s last match of the season on Tuesday, Nov. 24 at UC Irvine will start at 7:00 p.m. and will be played at Crawford Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66605\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66605\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/","id":5089,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5088,5087,5086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Cal State Bakersfield Looking for First Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos play Cal State Bakersfield tonight looking for their first win of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66553\" style=\"width: 266px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"38935930\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66603\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66553\" data-attachment-id=\"66553\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/dioseline-lopez-drives-down-the-court-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-10-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"Dioseline Lopez drives down the court.

Both the Gauchos and Roadrunners will be battling for their first wins of the season as CSUB is coming off having its 22-game home winning-streak ended in its 80-74 loss to Pacific last Friday.</p>\n<p>However, the Ducks made a shocking statement in their season opener with an upset victory over North Carolina on the road that knocked the Tar Heels out of their No. 22 ranking to start the year. Now 1-0 overall, the 79-77 triumph even earned Oregon one vote in the AP Top 25 rankings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB hopes to avenge its 74-64 loss to Cal State Bakersfield last season. Despite a career-high 16 points from junior guard Onome Jemerigbe, outshooting the Roadrunners 48.1 percent to 42.9 percent and double figure scoring from two other Gauchos, Santa Barbara still fell short. The Roadrunners shot lights out from three, making 52.4 percent of their long distance attempts to earn the come from behind victory.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for UCSB, former guards Brooklynn Hinkens and Tyonna Outland, the duo that scored 32 of the Roadrunners’ 74 points, are no longer with the program after graduating.</p>\n<p>But the Gauchos will have new concerns with defending senior forward Batabe Zempare. Not much of a scorer, having averaged just 9.5 ppg last season and eight in last year’s meeting against the Gauchos, she tallied 19 points on 52.9 percent shooting in the Roadrunners’ season opener.</p>\n<p>While her role on the team will include more scoring, Zempare is most effective in the paint when crashing the boards. Alongside her 19 points, she also recorded 19 rebounds for her first double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Cal State Bakersfield’s all-time leader in career rebounds entering her senior year with 813, Zempare’s team and conference high of 9.9 rebounds per game last season ranked 38th in the nation. Additionally, she led the WAC and Bakersfield with 14 double-doubles which ranked 27th in the country.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunners’ loss of two veteran guards could be beneficial for the Gauchos and their backcourt of seniors in Jemerigbe and Jasmine Ware, who scored 12 against CSUB last season. Although Ware fouled out late in the game, the two combined shot 12-for-20 from the field.</p>\n<p>Toning down the team’s average of 20 turnovers per game will be most important, especially against Bakersfield, who recorded eight steals against Pacific.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s matchup will be the Gauchos’ second meeting against a Pac-12 opponent this season.</p>\n<p>They face a greater challenge in Oregon, who has proven so far that there is no single strategy to containing their offense.</p>\n<p>The Ducks made 50.8 percent of their shots and were able to upset North Carolina with its tremendous perimeter shooting, making 13-of-29 attempts for a 44.8 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>Four players scored in double figures in Oregon’s season opener, and leading the way was sophomore guard Lexi Bando. She scored a team-high 18 points, tallying 12 of her points from beyond the arc on 4-for-8 shooting from deep.</p>\n<p>Helping create these opportunities on the perimeter is the Ducks’ length in the paint. Rebounding the ball for Oregon are forwards senior Jillian Alleyne and redshirt junior Jacinta Vandenberg.</p>\n<p>Vandenberg, a transfer from Fresno State, sat out last year as a redshirt and is still finding her role within the Oregon system as she only played 20 minutes in the team’s first game.</p>\n<p>With a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds in the upset of North Carolina, Alleyne is the leading force in the Ducks’ frontcourt. Entering this season, she ranked No. 16 in the ESPNW preseason list of top-25 players in the nation.</p>\n<p>Named an AP third-team All-American for the 2014-15 season, her streak of 21 double-doubles from her sophomore through junior seasons, is the third longest in NCAA history and is a Pac-12 and program streak record.</p>\n<p>She also holds single-season records for the conference and program in rebounds (519), double-doubles (29) and her 27 rebounds versus Portland State as a freshman is the most in a game in both Pac-12 and school history.</p>\n<p>Alleyne’s career achievements earned her invitations to the USA junior team camp tryouts in 2013 and World University Games and Pan-Am Games camp in 2015.</p>\n<p>UCSB has been outrebounded 97-75 in its last two games this season. Despite being undersized in the paint, Santa Barbara must find a way to be aggressive with boxing out and outhustling the Ducks for rebounds.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s home opener on Nov. 19th versus CSUB begins at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome. UCSB will travel to Oregon to face the Ducks this Sunday, Nov. 22nd in Matthew Knight Arena at 12:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/","id":398,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[397,396,395],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Valiant Effort from No. 15 UCSB Falls Short in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Playing in their first Big West final since 2011, the Gauchos fell 1-0 to Cal State Fullerton despite a 22-6 advantage in shots.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66463\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"750721530\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66505\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66463\" data-attachment-id=\"66463\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/msoccer_vsfullerton-20151114-dustinharris-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Before CSU Fullterton's defense can get to it, Nick DePuy traps the ball.

With their fourth straight win, the Titans secured their second consecutive Big West title while improving to a 13-7-1 overall, 6-3-1 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB’s season is not over despite the loss, as it will play in the NCAA Tournament this Sunday. The Gauchos received a first round bye and the No. 15 seed in the tournament and will host the winner between South Carolina and Furman’s first round game which takes place on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“You start the season with one goal in mind and that’s to be the number one team,” Vom Steeg said. “For us, that starts with making the NCAA Tournament. That’s what we strive for.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton also qualifies for the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year and will play Santa Clara in the first round on Thursday. Head Coach George Kuntz improved to an outstanding record of 13-1-1 in the Big West Tournament with the win, earning his sixth Big West title in the process.</p>\n<p>In a match that was dominated by the Gauchos from the opening whistle, it felt for much of the game as if the home side was bound to score at any moment. UCSB saw several close scoring chances in the first half clang off the crossbar, including a free kick by sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht from 30 yards out.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara headed into the break with a 9-2 advantage in shots and the game’s only shot on frame through 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>The second half began with a bit of a momentum change as UCSB’s freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg was subbed out due to injury and Fullerton found itself with possession more consistently.</p>\n<p>“Justin’s been dealing with a shoulder issue for about 2-3 weeks now. He warmed up today before the game and dove and he said he just can’t dive to his right,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “Realistically, he’s probably not going to get through the season. Obviously Justin is very disappointed right now.”</p>\n<p>Although recording just two shots in the first half, the Titans doubled that mark in a matter of seconds, as Bell gave Fullerton all it would need to come away with the upset victory. After a throw in, a shot from the right side by senior midfielder Julian Okai came hard off the right post and fell right to Bell, who knocked in his first goal of the season past sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute.</p>\n<p>“When the throw went in, unfortunately [junior midfielder Josue Espana] just couldn’t clear it. It’s just luck, really. They got the ball and they scored,” sophomore center back Fuad Adeniyi said. “Tonight I think the whole back four did a really good job, but unfortunately that’s the game that we play. One slip-up, one mistake can cost you the whole thing.”</p>\n<p>The shocking turnaround forced the Gauchos to go into an all-out offensive mode, putting attacking players in at nearly every position outside of center back. Junior Ismaila Jome led the onslaught down the left wing, beating defenders and sending in a number of crosses for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB finally got the chance it was looking for in the 82<sup>nd</sup> minute, after junior forward Nick DePuy blocked a pass in the midfield which led to his own breakaway. Before the nation’s second-leading goalscorer could get a shot away, he was taken down from behind by Fullerton’s Ricardo Covarrubias just outside the box, who was sent off with a straight red card.</p>\n<p>Playing up a man, the Gauchos continued to send everything they had forward, resulting in their best scoring opportunity of the game in the 85<sup>th</sup> minute. DePuy working a perfect 1-2 combination with freshman defender Sam Strong on the right side of the box, but his right-footed strike went wide of the far post and the Gauchos’ attempted comeback fell short soon after.</p>\n<p>“The sequence with about seven minutes left was our best soccer,” the older Vom Steeg said. “You’ve got Nick at that back post with everything to shoot at and he’s your best scorer. We had him 8 yards out to tie the game up a man and we know where that would’ve gone with them having the red card.”</p>\n<p>DePuy led his team with eight shots, three more than the entire Fullerton team, but UCSB was hurt by the fact that only six of its 22 shots were on goal. It was just the third time all season that Santa Barbara reached the 20-shot mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have not won a Big West Championship since 2010 and last played in the final in 2011, when they lost to UC Irvine 3-2. The road to their first NCAA championship since 2006 begins on Sunday when they host either South Carolina or Furman in the NCAA Tournament Second Round.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/","id":1472,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1471,1470,1469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Childress Tips In Game-Winner, UCSB Defeats Nebraska-Omaha 60-59","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Playing without senior Michael Bryson, the Gauchos finish the game on a 9-1 run to come away with a close win in their first game of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66481\" style=\"width: 195px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1809710560\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66506\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66481\" data-attachment-id=\"66481\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/john-green-drives-toward-the-hoop-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"John Green drives toward the hoop.

The basket was Childress’s only one on the night, capping off a 9-1 run over the final 4:19 to give the Gauchos a 60-59 win.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara earned the victory despite playing without senior guard Michael Bryson, the team’s leading returning scorer and rebounder from last season, who was suspended for one game by the NCAA for playing in an unsanctioned summer league game in July.</p>\n<p>Shouldering the load in Bryson’s place was senior guard John Green, who led the way with game-highs of 22 points and 13 rebounds. However, with Green fouling out with 3:54 left to play, Childress and sophomore point guard Gabe Vincent took over to bring UCSB back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a close first half, the Mavericks finally took control thanks to a 25-4 run in the second half to put them up 58-51.</p>\n<p>With his team down by seven with less than five minutes to go, Vincent knocked down a deep three just 25 seconds prior to Green fouling out. Childress followed that up by knocking down two clutch free throws at the 3:02 mark to cut the lead to 58-56.</p>\n<p>Omaha’s Tre’Shawn Thurman went 1-for-2 at the line with 1:36 left to go, leading to a pretty driving score by Vincent just eight seconds later to make it a one point game at 59-58.</p>\n<p>A pair of missed three-point attempts by the Mavericks gave the Gauchos possession with 38 seconds left. After deciding not to call for a timeout, UCSB freshman Justin Burks failed to connect on a three with 22 ticks to go. Childress was able to rise up and tip the ball out to senior guard T.J. Taylor in the corner, leading to a Gaucho timeout with 12 seconds left.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Mitch Brewe received a pass from Vincent and put up a shot with four seconds left that rimmed out, but Childress was there for the put back and Omaha was unable to get off a final shot.</p>\n<p>It was a poor shooting night for both teams, as the Gauchos finished shooting just 34.9 percent (22-63 FG) and the Mavericks not much better at 34.7 percent (17-49). UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams was surprised to come away with the win given his team’s 20 turnovers compared to just 10 assists, but the Gauchos were helped out by Omaha’s similar mark of 19 TOs and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>Brewe finished with nine points and five rebounds off the bench on a solid 4-5 shooting night. Senior guard DaJuan Smith reeled in a career-high eight rebounds, including four on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Omaha had three players score in double figures, including Thurman with a near double-double at 10 points, nine rebounds, and Randy Reed, who recorded 14 points and eight rebounds while going a perfect 8-8 from the line.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back in action tonight on the road against Cal with tip-off set for 7 p.m. at Haas Pavilion. The Golden Bears came into the season ranked No. 14 in the nation and defeated Rice 97-65 in their season-opener as five different players scored in double figures.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/","id":399,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[398,397,396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Scoring Spree in Season Finale Helps Gauchos Clinch No. 6 Seed in MPSF Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_9157-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_9157-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"For the first time since 2013, the No. 6 UCSB men's water polo team finished with a winning overall record at 15-9 after Its 17-8 rout of Pepperdine on Sunday.

The Waves have now lost their last six games, and seven of their last eight.</p>\n<p>As a result of the loss, Pepperdine will have the ninth seed in the tournament and will play a tie-in game versus Long Beach State. As the sixth seed, UCSB will have a rematch against No. 2 Cal, who secured its third seed with a victory over No. 5 Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With much at stake, the Gauchos responded by putting on one of their better performances this season. Although they started off a bit sluggish, an onslaught of 13 goals in the second-half helped propel them to a win in the final game of the regular season.</p>\n<p>The match started with the Waves going up 1-0 after scoring on their first possession. Shoemaker answered back for UCSB, scoring back-to-back goals to give it a 2-1 lead at the end of the first quarter. Once the Gauchos took the lead, they contained it for the game’s entirety.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened up the second period with a goal from junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton. Shoemaker completed a hat trick with just under a minute left in the frame and gave his team a 4-1 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine commenced the second half with another strong score, but was countered when sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild scored a deep goal to keep the UCSB lead at a margin of three.</p>\n<p>Senior two-meters Liam Gaughan and Nick Jordan extended the lead with goals of their own, making the score 7-2. UCSB would add three more goals to its total while only surrendering one score to take a commanding 10-3 lead in the final frame.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter consisted of a lot of scoring by both teams, but with no doubt of who the winner would be. The Gauchos outscored the Waves 7-5 in the fourth and won 17-8. Scorers in the final frame included Jordan, Hauschild, freshman driver Boris Jovanovic, junior utility Tor Jenson and junior two-meter Anthony Buljan.</p>\n<p>Along with the impressive victory, UCSB also set a new season-high for points in a game coincidentally just one week after it had set its previous season-high. Santa Barbara also set a season-high for points in a half, doubling its previous mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end the season on a high note with a two-game winning streak and a nine loss season, their lowest total since 2008. They also end the season with a winning road record of 4-2 for the first time since 2013.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB improved upon its underwhelming performance in MPSF play last year in which it did not win a single game. This year, Santa Barbara won four conference games and finished with a winning overall record, something it hadn’t accomplished since 2013.</p>\n<p>While each accomplishment is a sign of progression after a frustrating conference finish last year, the Gauchos season is far from over. Their match against Cal will be the fourth meeting between the two squads. The Bears have won each of the previous three matches this season.</p>\n<p>Defeating Pepperdine was a great way to end the regular season, but the real season has only just begun for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face-off against Cal in the quarterfinals of the MPSF Tournament on Friday, Nov. 20<sup>th</sup> at USC’s Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 1:00 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

A total of five Gauchos had three or more fouls and the team finished with 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Much credit is deserved by the Cougars’ defense as they recorded 15 steals and nine blocks to hold UCSB’s offense to a 25.6 percent shooting night and 14.3 percentage from long distance. Washington State benefitted from its stout defense by scoring 25 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for Washington State to adjust to the Gauchos’ offense after UCSB earned a 13-11 lead at the end of the first quarter. Santa Barbara’s first possession resulted in a made jump shot by senior guard Jasmine Ware.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 45.5 percent from the field, making 5-of-11 shot attempts in the first quarter. Miller’s one make from behind the perimeter was her only field goal in six attempts from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Two quick fouls early in the second quarter sent UCSB freshman forward Kali Jones to the bench. With the core of the Gauchos’ offense on the sidelines, it prompted Washington State’s takeover.</p>\n<p>Despite a slow start in the first quarter, freshman forward Borislava Hristova was a driving force in the Cougars’ 13-4 run to open the second quarter. Her eight points helped Washington State outscore UCSB 20-8 in the quarter to take a 31-21 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Hristova finished with a game-high 15 points on six-of-nine shooting. She sank 50 percent of her three-point baskets, making two-of-four attempts and grabbed six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Washington State continued its scoring rally with an 8-2 run to begin the second half, gaining a 39-23 lead. Aside from the one layup made by senior center Melissa Maragnes, UCSB was limited to five free throw attempts to close the quarter.</p>\n<p>With a 43-28 lead entering the final quarter, WSU increased its lead to as many as 19 points with 3:11 left in regulation. The Gauchos came within 13 but could not trim the Cougars’ lead to any less as Ware made UCSB’s only three-point make of the fourth quarter as the game ended with WSU winning 61-44. Ware was the Gauchos’ leading scorer and rebounder with nine points and seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>When shot attempts won’t fall, a coach can only encourage their team to keep shooting in hopes of overcoming the slump. But an extra 12 shot attempts wasn’t enough for UCSB to shake its shooting woes.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos nearly replicated their shooting performance from the opening night as they recorded a 27.3 field goal percentage and a 15.8 three-point percentage against Idaho.</p>\n<p>Unlike Friday’s impressive start, UCSB didn’t score until halfway through the first quarter. It started 0-of-7 from the field and didn’t record its first make until the 4:36 mark of the game. This wasn’t until after Idaho’s 8-0 run to begin the quarter.</p>\n<p>Just when the Gauchos may have been trimming their deficit with a Miller three-pointer, three consecutive three-point field goals increased the Vandals’ lead to 17-5 to force a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>Draining one of the three-point makes was sophomore forward Geraldine McCorkell. She scored half of her game-high 14 points in the first quarter. Idaho restrained UCSB from scoring for the rest of the quarter to take a 19-5 lead at its ending.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 13 points in the second quarter was its highest for the game. Junior forward Mi’Chael Wright and sophomore guard Makala Roper scored two baskets each but their respective efforts weren’t enough to bring Idaho’s lead within single digits. The Vandals matched UCSB’s 13 points to take a 32-18 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>While UCSB wasn’t perfect from the free throw line, going 9-for-15, the Gauchos couldn’t find another source of scoring. Eight of the Gauchos’ points in the third quarter were scored from the free throw line as they shot eight-of-eight from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>With 39 second remaining, Santa Barbara’s first field goal in the quarter was a layup by Roper. She scored a team-high 13 points while shooting 5-of-11 from the field. A layup at the buzzer by Jones was UCSB’s last field goal in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Still, Santa Barbara did play solid perimeter defense as it held Idaho to 38.2 field goal and 27.6 three-point percentages.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB did turn the ball over 17 times. While the Vandals had 12 turnovers, they outscored UCSB 21-8 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>Down 22 points, UCSB didn’t score its first field goal until the 5:21 mark of the fourth quarter. Helping Idaho close the game was senior guard Christina Salvatore and senior forward Ali Forde. Both registered 10 points to help the Vandals secure their 64-42 victory.</p>\n<p>Next for UCSB is its home opener this Thursday, Nov. 19<sup>th</sup> versus Cal State Bakersfield.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66500\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/gauchos-offense-out-of-sync-in-season-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66500\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/gauchos-offense-out-of-sync-in-season-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/gauchos-offense-out-of-sync-in-season-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/gauchos-offense-out-of-sync-in-season-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/gauchos-offense-out-of-sync-in-season-opening-weekend/","id":389,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[388,387,386],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Season Series Versus CSUF, Split with UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-1 win over Cal State Fullerton on Friday ended the UCSB women's volleyball team's five-match losing slump.

The duo’s total of 51 assists contributed to the team finishing with a season-high of 59.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite a compelling performance the previous night, Santa Barbara could not follow up its win as it was swept by UC Riverside on Saturday. UCSB loss in straight sets by scores of 15-25, 23-25, and 21-25.</p>\n<p>The victory over the Titans ended UCSB’s five-match losing streak heading into the weekend, but Saturday’s outcome added another loss to the Gauchos’ records of 7-18 overall and 3-11 in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton continues to plummet after Friday’s loss and being swept by Cal Poly on Saturday. The Titans sit at 0-26 overall, 0-14 in conference matches, matching their second worst start in program history.</p>\n<p>However, it was a historic ending to the weekend for the Highlanders as they broke a program record for conference wins, earning their fifth in the sweep of UCSB. The 3-0 victory was the team’s second sweep of the season, creating another UCR record.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s quick start to open the match against CSUF led to it maintaining the lead throughout the entirety of the first set. An early 4-0 scoring run handed the Gauchos an 8-3 lead but would be trimmed as the Titans answered back with a 4-1 run of their own to pull within two at 7-9.</p>\n<p>Having the best season in her collegiate career, Grunt’s surge of three consecutive kills helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 13-7. Her 13 kills matched a season-high in attacks to go along with a .346 hitting clip. Grunt was the only Gaucho to record a solo block.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the first set with a .368 hitting percentage, holding Fullerton to a .135 clip for the 25-15 victory and 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Fullerton slowed down UCSB’s attack to a .286 hitting percentage in the second set and took an early 5-2 lead. But the Titans’ short stint of scores did not last long as they could not surpass the Gauchos’ defensive prowess.</p>\n<p>In addition to CSUF’s six errors, Santa Barbara allowed just seven kills to hold the Titans to a .028 hitting percentage. The Gauchos’ 76 digs were their second-most in a match this season. Leading UCSB in defensive scoops was freshman libero Emilia Petrachi with a match-high 26.</p>\n<p>Exchanges of scoring runs between the two teams resulted in Fullerton taking a 13-10 lead, ensuing a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the timeout was a reinvigorated Santa Barbara team as it achieved a 4-0 scoring rally of its own to force a CSUF timeout. But the Gauchos’ dominance persisted, extending into an 11-1 run that put them up 21-14 and eventually led to a 25-19 set victory.</p>\n<p>Five of Grunt’s 13 kills appeared during the set while UCSB notched four of its nine service aces as well, the total being its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>CSUF countered with an outstanding .448 hitting percentage in the third set. Most notably, Fullerton never trailed as it had 13 kills and zero errors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Katelyn Nielsen provided the spark to the Titans’ 16-5 run, tallying an individual 5-1 scoring run. She finished with a career-high 13 kills and helped lead Fullerton to its 25-14 win to cut the Gauchos’ lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>But Nielsen’s breakout performance was not enough to prevent UCSB from taking a 25-17 win in the final set for the 3-1 victory. UCSB’s .371 hitting percentage to end the match was its highest for the evening. Another four aces would appear as Sheffield had a match-high three.</p>\n<p>While neither team hit over a .300 clip in any set of Saturday’s match, UC Riverside’s offense was just enough to edge UCSB, specifically in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Villanueva registered another double digit hitting performance with 12 kills but was outperformed by the excellent attack of UCR’s senior outside hitter Helena Peric. She recorded a match-high 18 kills for the fourth time this season to lead Riverside to its 3-0 sweep of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Hawai’i next Saturday, Nov. 14<sup>th</sup> in its last home match of the season. It will also be the team’s senior night in which five players will be honored.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/","id":5088,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5087,5086,5085],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Confident Heading into Rematches After Success Earlier in Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Two weeks remain on the schedule for the UCSB women's volleyball team.

Despite earning victories over the Titans and Highlanders in previous meetings earlier this season, the Gauchos have struggled when playing on the road and are 1-6 in away matches.</p>\n<p>The troubles for Fullerton continue to pile up as it remains winless this season. CSUF is 0-24 overall and 0-12 in conference play. Dating back to the end of last season, the Titans are now on a 27-match losing streak.</p>\n<p>Still performing at a high level for the Titans is junior outside hitter Paige Reed. Overall, she ranks fifth in the Big West in digs per set with a 3.95 average. Since the start of conference play, she has moved up to fourth place, averaging 4.26 digs per set. She leads Fullerton in digs with 179.</p>\n<p>With regard to teams getting better, the gradual improvements throughout UCR’s season have resulted in some historical highlights for the Highlanders, who are 9-16 overall and 4-8 in conference matches. For just the fifth time in program history, Riverside won back-to-back Big West matches with their five set victory over Cal State Northridge and sweep of CSUF last weekend. Its nine overall wins is its most since 2005.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the sweep of Northridge handed UCR its fourth conference win of the season, tying its program record for Big West wins.</p>\n<p>Despite earning the 3-1 victory, Santa Barbara’s offense seemed to be a little disheveled by the Highlanders’ defense, having finished the match with a .152 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>“We need consistency,” Lantagne Welch said. “A lot of that stems from our serve-receive and our passing. Riverside is a really good defensive team. We’ll be more ready for that this time. If we’re passing the ball well, we’re going to have opportunities to score.”</p>\n<p>Improvements on the defensive end will be important for UCSB as well in hopes of containing the Highlanders’ senior outside hitter Helena Peric.</p>\n<p>She recently earned Big West Offensive Player of the Week honors after a phenomenal performance against CSUN. She tallied a career-high 23 kills and had 12 digs for her second double-double of the season to go along with a .308 hitting percentage. She continued her dominance with 15 kills, six digs, two service aces and a .379 hitting clip against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ containment begins at the net, a component of their defense in which they have excelled.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s average of 2.10 blocks per set ranks third overall in the Big West. In three of its last four matches, UCSB has registered double-digit blocking totals. The centerpieces to the Gauchos’ denial at the net are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield.</p>\n<p>They both rank within the top 10 overall of the Big West rankings in blocks per set and total blocks. Sheffield holds the team lead in both statistical categories with 82 blocks and a 0.95 blocks per set average while Grunt is second with 78 blocks and a 0.91 average.</p>\n<p>While UCSB was unable to find much success offensively in its first match versus UCR, it did respond with a .302 hitting night against Cal State Fullerton the following night. The Gauchos’ confidence helped carry them to a strong attack but they must find that same determination when they are out of sync as well.</p>\n<p>“It comes and goes,” Lantagne Welch said. “When we’re doing well, we’re very confident. When we struggle, we lose it too quickly. That’s something about getting tougher in that scenario and knowing that teams are going to make big plays and we’re going to mess up some. That’s okay, it’s just we need to respond right away.”</p>\n<p>ESPN3 will nationally broadcast the match between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton this Friday, Nov. 13th at 4:30 p.m. The Gauchos will bring their weekend to a close at UC Riverside on Saturday, Nov. 14th at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/","id":5082,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5081,5080,5079],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Goal Springs No. 17 UCSB to Big West Final","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After defeating UC Davis for the third time in 2015, the Gauchos will play in their first Big West Tournament Championship since 2011 this Saturday against Cal State Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66388\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"603435463\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66391\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66388\" data-attachment-id=\"66388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/mens_soccer_ucd_111115_eric_swenson_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ahinga Selemani crosses the ball in for an unsuccessful attempt on goal.

Anytime you play a team that if they lose their season’s over, you’re going to get everything they have,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We played well tonight.

However, UCSB completed a perfect 3-0 sweep of Davis in 2015, dropping the Aggies to 8-10-3 overall, 3-5-3 conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now host Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Tournament finals this Saturday. The Titans overcame an early 1-0 deficit against Cal Poly last night to take a 3-1 win at home, thanks to a second half brace by sophomore midfielder Diego Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Fullerton enters the championship game this Saturday as the No. 1 seed in the Big West South, boasting a record of 12-7-1 overall, 7-3-1 conference.</p>\n<p>After having 11 days off since their last regular season game, the Gauchos came out rested and healthy on Wednesday night. The game marked the third consecutive year that UCSB has entered the semifinals with home-field advantage and the No. 1 seed, but in the past the Gauchos have not been able to get the job done despite playing at home, going 0-3 in the postseason since 2013.</p>\n<p>That all changed last night thanks to a timely one-two between Selemani and sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who was placed in a more attacking role than he has been for most of the season. After receiving the ball back on the give and go, Selemani fired a shocking shot in from 25 yards out to give UCSB its only goal against Davis all season that didn’t come from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to finally bring a playoff win at home,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’ve had so many letdowns in front of our fans, but to finally get into that Big West final it’s a new experience for all of us and it’s a really good opportunity to make some noise and get into the NCAA Tournament.”</p>\n<p>It was the fourth goal for Selemani all season, justifying his All-Big West Second Team selection in his first year with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“My goal was basically to get as many chances as I could,” Selemani said. “I was fortunate enough to get a ball from Kevin in the second half. It’s a strength of mine to put the ball on my left foot and I was lucky enough to get it past the keeper.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara gained control of the game about 15 minutes in. Dominating possession for the rest of the first half and finding several good scoring chances. Junior Ismaila Jome, who has missed significant time this season with an ankle injury, was dangerous nearly every time he touched the ball, torching defenders and sending balls in from the left wing. However, Davis was able to keep the game scoreless all the way until the break.</p>\n<p>“I had the luxury tonight of this being the first time that I can remember going into the Big West Tournament with a full complement of players,” Vom Steeg said. “[Davis] got tired, we were able to press them a little bit, we needed one good shot and Ahinga got that for us tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies picked up the pressure in the second half, attacking UCSB hard on the counter. They found their best chance to score in the 54th minute, when a header by freshman forward Kristian Heptner forced freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make an outstanding one-handed, diving save just inside the post.</p>\n<p>It was a relatively quiet night for Vom Steeg, but his two saves in the game helped give UCSB its second consecutive 1-0 victory, both of which came against Davis.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was a great game. It was entertaining,” Davis Head Coach Dwayne Shaffer said. “I give all the credit to Santa Barbara, that’s probably the best team I’ve seen in Santa Barbara in five years. I was impressed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will now shift its focus to Saturday’s game, when it will play a Fullerton team that it took two overtimes to defeat at home just over a month ago.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament Championship will be played Saturday night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of November 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66391\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66391\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/","id":1463,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1462,1461,1460],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Visits Midwest for Season Opener, Bryson Suspended","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After a strong exhibition performance, in which senior guards Michael Bryson and John Green combined for 43 points in a 66-45 win over SFSU, the UCSB men's basketball team will be on the road at Nebra...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The post Big-Al era officially tips off this Friday when the UCSB men’s basketball team heads on the road to face Nebraska-Omaha in both teams’ season-opener.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66358\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"922315923\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66357\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66358\" data-attachment-id=\"66358\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/michael-bryson-searches-for-a-way-past-the-defender-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"Michael Bryson searches for a way past the defender.

Senior guards John Green and Michael Bryson handled the offensive load in that game, scoring 23 and 20 points, respectively.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a series of unfortunate injuries kept Green out for much of his collegiate career, he was finally able to stay healthy last season, playing in all 33 games. His averages of 11.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game earned him an All-Big West Honorable Mention. He figures to be one of the team’s most critical players in his senior year, especially with the departure of UCSB great Alan Williams.</p>\n<p>Alongside Green as one of the team’s two starting guard/forward combo players is Bryson, the only Gaucho who was named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team. With averages of 13.9 points and 4.8 rebounds a game in 2014-15, Bryson was named First Team All-Big West. Unfortunately for UCSB, he will be unavailable for Friday’s game after he was suspended by the NCAA earlier this week for playing in an unsanctioned summer league game in July.</p>\n<p>With their most proven, consistent scorer out of the lineup, the Gauchos will need to rely on their other role players to provide a scoring punch. That shouldn’t be a problem for reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent. The sophomore had averages of 10.1 points and 2.1 assists per game last season and was second on the team in threes with 57, knocking the long ball down at an efficient rate of 41.6 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have huge shoes to fill in the middle with Williams, the program’s all-time leading rebounder and second all-time leading scorer, now playing in the Chinese Basketball Association. However, if Head Coach Bob Williams continues to stick with the starting lineup he used against San Francisco, which included two point guards in Vincent and junior Eric Childress, the former inside-out approach that utilized “Big Al” in the center position may be replaced with a small ball, guard-heavy offensive style.</p>\n<p>Nebraska-Omaha has not played since August, when it went a perfect 4-0 on a tour through Italy, outscoring its foreign opponents by an average margin of 48.5 points per game. In the Summit League Preseason Poll, the Mavericks were picked to finish seventh out of nine teams in the conference this season, with no players being named to the Preseason All-Conference first or second teams.</p>\n<p>Friday’s game will be the first of 10 non-conference games away from home for UCSB. The Gauchos will play only three non-conference home games this season and two games on a neutral site when they face Akron and Iona in Las Vegas over winter break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not played a season opener without Big Al since 2011. Playing without him in 2014-15, the Gauchos went an impressive 5-2, a mark which gives them confidence that they will be able to succeed this season playing without their focal point from the last three years.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s and Nebraska-Omaha’s seasons tip-off at 5 p.m. this Friday at Ralston Arena in Nebraska.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of November 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66357\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66357\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/","id":397,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[396,395,394],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Make Season Debut on the Road at Washington State, Face Idaho on Sunday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson prepares for her first regular season game with the UCSB women's basketball team this Friday at Washington State.

Certainly, limiting turnovers and improving at the free throw line were areas of focus in this week’s practices.</p>\n<p>“We shot 43 percent, you can beat a lot of people shooting 43 percent. The problem is we didn’t get enough shots,” Henrickson said. “The free throws are a confidence thing and you have to earn your confidence.We’ll get better there but we’ve got to take care of the ball and not turn it over.”</p>\n<p>While it will be Bonnie Henrickson’s official debut as UCSB’s head coach, it will be a rematch between the Gauchos and Cougars. Last season’s meeting resulted in an 81-55 Washington State victory over UCSB in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Despite the lopsided defeat, UCSB trailed by just seven points, 28-35, at halftime. With the losses of former All-Pac-12 guards Lia Galdeira and Tia Presley, both of whom are pursuing professional playing careers overseas, the Washington St. lineup has lost a significant portion of its scoring.</p>\n<p>When combined, Galdeira and Presley averaged 36.7 points and 9.5 rebounds per game and had a total of 172 steals last season. The two scored 45 of the team’s 81 points against UCSB and Galdeira registered a game-high four steals. Apart from the former backcourt, no other WSU player averaged double-digit points per game.</p>\n<p>The Cougars, however, seem to have a solution for the absence of the guards after a 79-37 exhibition win over Lewis-Clark State College this past Sunday. All 14 of the players on WSU’s roster scored, while freshman forward Borislava Hristova recorded a game-high 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting, two-of-three from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB had the size advantage in its exhibition bout versus Cal State Dominguez Hills on Sunday, but will be challenged by the height of the Cougars. A total of seven players stand 6 feet and taller for WSU, the tallest being sophomore center Bianca Blanaru at 6 feet 5 inches.</p>\n<p>However, after shooting 11-of-12 from the field for 22 points and grabbing a game-high eight rebounds in her collegiate debut for UCSB, it may take more than size to contain freshman forward Kali Jones.</p>\n<p>Her ability to post-up and use her power in the paint along with her soft release when shooting the short jump hook or finishing at the basket with a layup could be the difference in overcoming the Cougars’ tall frame on defense.</p>\n<p>Jones came off the bench in UCSB’s exhibition loss, playing 29 minutes. Due to an ankle injury, Jones did not start in the Gauchos’ preseason game on Sunday but still managed to play and  will be ready to start for Friday’s season opener.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t know until shootaround that morning that she would even play,” Henrickson said. “She hadn’t practice all week because of the ankle. She would have started had she not had the ankle issue because she has been the most productive big.”</p>\n<p>In addition to her play, UCSB’s ability to convert points off turnovers will be pivotal, as the Cougars had trouble handling the ball in their exhibition victory, recording 22 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Another chance at redemption presents itself in UCSB’s visit to the University of Idaho this Sunday.</p>\n<p>Last year’s contest nearly went into overtime, but ended with a UCSB turnover and two makes at the free throw line by former guard and current member of the Perth Lynx, Stacey Barr, who scored a game-high 20 points for the 47-44 Idaho win.</p>\n<p>The Vandals faced Lewis-Clark State College on Friday, routing the Warriors in a 93-58 exhibition victory. Idaho was spot on from three-point distance, draining 41.7 percent on 15-of-36 shooting from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Connie Ballestero led all players in scoring and assists with 17 points and six helpers. She shot four-of-seven from the field, all of her made field goals being three-pointers in which she attempted five from long distance.</p>\n<p>The three ball proved to be the difference in last season’s meeting between the two teams. While Idaho made just 9-of-25 of its attempts from the perimeter, UCSB recorded a 7.1 three-point percentage on 1-of-14 shooting from deep.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos made 25 percent of their three-point attempts on Sunday. UCSB’s offense does not revolve around perimeter shots but being able to sink some from long distance would definitely be helpful.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos must find a way to defend the three ball and keep the Vandals off the perimeter. While this will be no easy task, Santa Barbara’s mindset suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p>“We know the feeling of last year,” senior guard Jasmine Ware said. “We have good intensity and a competitive mindset, just looking at the scouts and knowing the players. Not giving up points in transition and being able to stay down and guard someone one-on-one, that’s the big thing we’re working on.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s season opener at Washington St. this Friday, Nov. 13 will tip off at 8:30 p.m. Its game at Idaho on Sunday, Nov. 15 will begin at 2:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66364\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66364\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/","id":396,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[395,394,393],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From Sacrifice to Paradise","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensWaterPolo_10-3-15_4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensWaterPolo_10-3-15_4-web.jpg?resize=600%2C590&ssl=1","description":"Mitchell Hamilton was a key water polo player at the school of his dreams through his first two years of college, but had to make the move to UCSB to continue playing the game he loves.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66371\" style=\"width: 385px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensWaterPolo_10-3-15_4-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1295815293\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66361\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66371\" data-attachment-id=\"66371\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/from-sacrifice-to-paradise/mitchell-hamilton-passes-the-ball-to-a-teammate-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensWaterPolo_10-3-15_4-web.jpg?fit=600%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,590\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Mitchell Hamilton passes the ball to a teammate.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Moving away is always a difficult thing to do. No matter the age, moving away from the people you made bonds with and the places you grew attached to is something that most would like to avoid.</p>\n<p>Sometimes though, moving away to a new place is the only option to keep on doing what they love. This is true about UCSB’s own Mitchell Hamilton, a junior sociology major who had to leave his dream school to come to Santa Barbara and continue doing what he loves most: playing water polo. It is a decision he certainly has come to love and embrace.</p>\n<p>Hamilton grew up loving water polo. He was a star polo player in high school, leading his team to four league championships. He was also honored with achievements such as First Team All-America and First Team All CCS. However, he says he owes all his success to his mother, the person who encouraged him to play such a demanding sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I started playing water polo when I was in seventh grade,” Hamilton said. “My mom was the one who pushed me into water polo and I really owe a lot to her.”</p>\n<p>Being the great high school player that he was, Hamilton had many options to continue his playing career. Ultimately he settled on Cal, a school he admired growing up, not only for its academics, but also its consistently good water polo program.</p>\n<p>Hamilton seemed to have made the right choice at the time. As a freshman, he scored 16 goals for the Golden Bears and was a key player on the team. Cal eventually made it to the MPSF Championship against USC before losing the match 9-5. Still, as a freshman Hamilton played a big role, scoring two goals in that game, a good sign for the future.</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Hamilton again registered 16 goals along with 15 assists. Once again he was a big factor on the team even though it didn’t make a run as deep as the year before.</p>\n<p>“I loved Cal. The players were great.” Hamilton said. “I liked the competiveness that went on in practice. I felt like everybody was really fighting for a spot to travel every practice.”</p>\n<p>Although Hamilton showed great promise and had a great two years at Cal, something always bothered him. He kept on having troubles with the coaching staff. The issues got so bad that he decided to leave the water polo program after his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>“After a while I didn’t see eye-to-eye with the coach, which is why I left the program.” Hamilton said. “I didn’t want to play for him anymore. It was a tough personal choice.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton now was faced with the toughest choice of his young adult life; to return to Cal without ever playing water polo again or leave the school he loved. He decided to take a semester away from school to really think about what he wanted, working as a math tutor and caterer in the meantime.</p>\n<p>“It was actually really fun,” Hamilton said happily. “It was nice to make some money and just take time off. My family was also very supportive, something I am thankful for.”</p>\n<p>While Hamilton was deciding his next step during the 2014-2015 campaign, the UCSB water polo program was suffering its worst season ever. The Gauchos finished 11-15, winless in conference play, and finished seventh place in the MPSF championships.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Wolf Wigo knew his roster was more than talented to make a better run next year but he also knew getting a player like Hamilton wouldn’t hurt. The two were almost meant for each other. Hamilton needed a new start and Wigo needed another attacker to replace Eric Van de Mortel, who graduated after last season as one of UCSB’s top offensive players.</p>\n<p>“When Wolf reached out and contacted me, he really highlighted the great opportunities I would have at UCSB,” Hamilton said. “And the guys on the team are all a bunch of winners, which are the type of people I like hanging out with.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Hamilton was swayed and decided to come play his remaining two years of eligibility at Santa Barbara, a decision that has been beneficial for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Since coming here, Hamilton has set new career highs in both goals scored and steals with 21 and 18 respectively. He has also become a team leader and is a guy that the whole locker room respects.</p>\n<p>“My new career highs are cool but I’m not worried about that,” Hamilton said. “I’m just really happy to be on such a great water polo team and contributing to wins.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton’s modesty is admirable; however, his head coach knows that he is a big factor on this team and is happy that he decided to join.</p>\n<p>“He’s the fastest guy on this team,” Wigo said. “He helps with the counter-attack and he’s a great player enjoying a great season. He’s also a guy that works everyday as hard as he can and sets a good example for the younger guys. I’m really proud of him.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton is not just a hit with the coaching staff, but also with the players. He is a great locker room guy that the players love being around. This is no more apparent than with seniors Derek Shoemaker and Chris Whitelegge.</p>\n<p>“He plays a huge role on this team and his shot is deadly,” Shoemaker said. “He’s my roommate and I love hanging with him. He’s a great influence and he’s been a great teammate.”</p>\n<p>“He’s just such a skilled player.” Whitelegge added. “I remember playing against him when he was at Cal and he was good then, I’m glad he plays for us now. He’s great to be around and his positive energy constantly rubs off on the team.”</p>\n<p>With the seniors departing soon as the season is coming to an end, Hamilton will be the new face of UCSB water polo, something that he has earned with his great play and something he hopes to keep living up to.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, leaving Cal was very hard, but it seems to have paid off for Hamilton. He has been able to be a factor on a team that has been very welcoming of him and he has come to love the atmosphere of Santa Barbara in general.</p>\n<p>“I love the ocean, and the girls are beautiful here,” Hamilton jokingly said. “I just really love it here and I love this team. I love being back on a team with a bunch of great dudes, playing a game I love. SB is beautiful and everybody seems like they are happy to be here.”</p>\n<p>Leaving is certainly a tough thing to do, but sometimes in the end, it is worth it. It has worked out for Mitch Hamilton and it has most definitely worked out for anyone associated with UCSB water polo.
