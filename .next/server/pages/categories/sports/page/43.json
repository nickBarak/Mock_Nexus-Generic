The Anteaters are coming off a tough 8-7 loss to Long Beach State last Friday.</p>\n<p>With a win, they would have been the recipient of a first-round bye, but instead, they face UCSB, a team they have defeated two of the three times this season.</p>\n<p>The two teams first met at the Triton Invitational where the Gauchos outlasted the Anteaters 14-12 in overtime. UC Irvine would win the next two matches by a combined total of four goals, and the last meeting came down to the final possession.</p>\n<p>The main point is that these two teams while having a big discrepancy in the record, are actually pretty well-matched.</p>\n<p>UCSB certainly has a lot going for it, with its five players earning All-GCC honors being headlined by seniors Reed Cotterill and Shane Hauschild earning first and second team accolades, respectively.</p>\n<p>Cotterill, a utility, led UCSB in drawn exclusions with 25 while also adding 18 goals. Hauschild, an attacker, led the team in most offensive categories including goals (33), assists (18), steals (29) and points (51).</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Ivan Gvozdanovic was named an All-GCC Honorable Mention despite missing the final seven contests of the season due to an undisclosed injury. At one point, he was leading the team in goals before being passed up by Hauschild. The Serbian native finished with 24 goals and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>In fact, the biggest reason for the Gauchos’ lackluster performance in conference play was the non-availability of Gvozdanovic and junior driver Boris Jovanovic. Both players were headed for career-high seasons, but injuries derailed their season as well as the team as a whole.</p>\n<p>However, if Santa Barbara proved anything last Friday, it’s that it still can beat quality teams in this conference thanks to the efforts of players like Hauschild and Cotterill, who will most likely be playing their final matches in a UCSB uniform this weekend.</p>\n<p>Even with that, UC Irvine will certainly not be an easy first-round match for any team, especially the sixth-seeded Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Irvine is led by utility Lovre Milos, who finished tied for second in the GCC in goals scored with 61. The senior was also the league’s leading assist man with 43.</p>\n<p>Milos has had a decorated four years as an Anteater, with at least 60 goals in the past three seasons and a career-high 92 during the 2014-15 season.</p>\n<p>Despite redshirting last season, the senior has not missed a beat as the league’s leading point-getter with 104 and has snatched the fourth most steals with 43 swipes.</p>\n<p>Along with the senior, the Anteaters are also confident due to the fact they have freshman phenom, Fynn Schuetze. The attacker from Hildesheim, Germany was named the conference’s Co-Newcomer of the Year after a standout 36-goal, 18-assist campaign.</p>\n<p>In the cage, senior Matej Matijevic is still one of the best goalkeepers in the league, racking up 278 saves this season, the second-highest total, and the fifth highest save percentage with a .625 mark.<br>\nHe was also an All-First Team GCC recipient.</p>\n<p>Other key notables include seniors Robby Stiefel, who went 52-10 in the sprint battles, and Kyle Trush, an honorable mention, who was second on the team in assists with 20.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ struggles have mostly come in the back end due to injuries, the team is certainly still talented enough to pull off a run and try to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a long time.<br>\nLast season, UCSB was the No. 1 seed in the GCC tournament and was quickly upset, ending its hopes.</p>\n<p>This year is the exact opposite. No expectations, no pressure, no anything. Maybe this is what the Gauchos want.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on UC Irvine at 6 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 17, at the Anteater Aquatics Complex, the site for this year’s conference tournament.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Suddenly, UCSB found themselves down 11 points with 8:18 left in the fourth and would have to gouge their way back if they wanted a shot at winning the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to have turnover woes, with two turnovers early in the final frame preventing them from gaining any headway.</p>\n<p>Powerfully pursuing the challenge of fighting an uphill battle, halfway through the fourth quarter, Santa Barbara began to gallop back into the game, offsetting their scoring struggles with a 9-2 scoring clinic as time dwindled down just under five minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>The visiting Gauchos grew electrifyingly aggressive on defense as the quarter went on, with a series of great defensive stands resulting in UCSB taking four charges down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Down eight with 2:26 to go, the Gauchos rallied off five straight points to cut the score to 61-64 with just under 36 seconds left thanks to a surge led by yet another Bates three-pointer and topped off with a clutch layup by redshirt Junior guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Porter’s layup, things seemed to be going Santa Barbara’s way, as after an intentional foul by the Gauchos, the Broncos junior guard Dru Toleafoa proceeded to miss both free throws giving the visiting team the opportunity to tie the game up in the next possession.</p>\n<p>However, the anticipated late-quarter comeback was immediately put to rest when the Gauchos had a calamitous turnover by freshman guard Danae Miller on the inbounds play. UCSB tried to continue playing the foul game but to no avail as its fate was sealed losing its first game of the season, 68-63.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 45.8 percent on 22 for 48 shooting, while the home team shot at a better 47.1 percent on 24 for 51 shooting.</p>\n<p>21 Gaucho turnovers had a massive impact on the outcome of the game, as there were too many giveaways late in the game for Santa Barbara to recover. Each mistake proved to be more costly than the last, as Santa Clara scored 19 points off those turnovers.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman had another consistent high scoring game.

Santa Barbara’s dependence on the second-year guard is not only in terms of scoring, but also includes the duty of running the Gauchos’ offense.</p>\n<p>Down in the post, both Jalen Canty and Leland King II will be battling on the frontlines of what the Gauchos like to call the “rebound war.”</p>\n<p>King II scooped up a game high nine rebounds in UCSB’s last game against NDSU while Canty notched seven, but it will be a whole new battle against the strong frontcourt of the Panthers, who currently average 34 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ post-game conference this past Saturday, UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack stressed the value that this team gives to winning rebounds and loose balls. This is valuable as doing such dirty work is essential when going up against any Power-5 conference opponent such as Pitt.</p>\n<p>The Panthers come into the game 0-2, which means the Gauchos are more than likely going to withstand a big burst of energy to start the game. Pitt has trailed to start the second half in both of their games this year, something the coaching staff will certainly be looking to change.</p>\n<p>It’s going to be up to UCSB to keep the home crowd out of the game and match Pitt’s runs, which starts on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>One major aspect of the defensive game plan for UCSB will be limiting the production of Pittsburgh’s two most dynamic players, junior guard Jared Wilson-Frame and senior forward Ryan Luther.</p>\n<p>The junior combo guard out of Hartford, Conn., is averaging 17.5 points per game so far,and is most lethal when maneuvering his 6’5” frame into getting a good shot over smaller defenders.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Luther has been a force in the paint thus far. He was the team’s leading scorer last year and has shown solid production for both rebounds and scoring as he is currently averaging 16 points and 9.5 rebounds through two games this season.</p>\n<p>Last game, the Gauchos were able to stifle NDSU’s offense with an active and switch-heavy defense. It was easier to switch against the Bison because their best player was a guard, but having to face a skilled big man like Luther offers a different concern for their defensive game plan.</p>\n<p>How UCSB communicates on pick and rolls will be a big factor in how effective their defense is on Wednesday, as switching too much can lead to big mismatches.</p>\n<p>If Saturday’s game was any indication, the Gauchos have a lot of firepower. They turned in their first 80-point performance since the first round of the Big West Tournament in 2016 with ease and have a few players that can catch fire at any time.</p>\n<p>However, a hot shooting night may not just be enough while on the road. Going forward with this next slate of opponents, high discipline on both ends of the floor will be the most important goal for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Pitt at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, November 15 at the Petersen Events Center. The game will also be streamed on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Their most recent faceoff with the Broncos was in the 2016-2017 season, which resulted in a 69-58 loss for the Gauchos at home.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has not defeated Santa Clara since Nov. 23, 2013 while on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 48.5 percent on 33-for-68 shooting against Northern Arizona last game, with four Gauchos scoring in double-digits. Freshman guard Sarah Bates led the team with a commanding 25 points, helping keep UCSB’s offensive success afloat.</p>\n<p>To replicate another win, UCSB will need to come out with the same firepower, as was the case against the Lumberjacks. The Gauchos shot 7-for- 9 from three-point range in the first quarter and 14-for-30 from downtown overall.</p>\n<p>Despite the Gauchos’ offensive surge beyond the arc – defensively, they seemed sparse.</p>\n<p>Allowing the Lumberjacks to score on 47.4 percent shooting, the Gauchos woefully permitted Northern Arizona to score 14 points off 11 turnovers, and was beat by NAU on the boards.</p>\n<p>Defense will be a key factor in the bout against Santa Clara, as the Broncos established a strong defensive presence against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara forced 20 turnovers and tallied 16 steals in its matchup against the Titans. Santa Barbara will need to be cautious when in possession of the ball as the Broncos scored 22 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>A crucial player for the Broncos to look out for will be Santa Clara junior guard Emily Wolph, who is fresh off a career-high 27-point game.</p>\n<p>In addition to Wolph, the Broncos have found a way to share the wealth as a result of other players scoring. Senior guards Taylor Berry (14), Kyla Martin (11), and senior forward Morgan McGwire (11) all scored double digits in the Broncos’ loss to Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Broncos loss to the Titans at home was highlighted by a 7-minute scoreless stretch in the fourth quarter. It will be essential for the visiting Gauchos to take advantage of such stretches if they occur by being assertive offensively.</p>\n<p>UCSB goes into the game having lost the rebound battle between itself and Northern Arizona (38-43). An advantage on the boards could ignite success for the Gauchos considering that Santa Clara only recorded 28 rebounds against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>An opportunity to win the battle on the boards could translate into the extension of possessions which turns into buckets.</p>\n<p>Bench play will also have an enormous impact on the game, as UCSB’s bench outscored the Lumberjacks 26-14. Santa Clara had subpar production from its bench last game, only scoring 15 as a unit.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos undeniably have more depth than the Broncos. During their last game, Santa Clara had three players well over 30 minutes of playing time, while UCSB only had two players who scarcely played over half an hour.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has to be sure to exploit Santa Clara’s endurance and keep the momentum in its favor by using the depth of its roster in hopes of out hustling the opposing team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will go head-to-head with Santa Clara at the Leavey Center on Tuesday, Nov. 14 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/","id":657,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[656,655,654],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Use High Scoring Effort to Open Season With a Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-13-at-9.27.10-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-13-at-9.27.10-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite being on the road, the UCSB women's basketball team stepped up when it mattered most in its season opener.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_76249\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1916164957\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79658\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76249\" data-attachment-id=\"76249\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/aliceah-hernandez-pivots-around-her-opponent-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_11-web.jpg?fit=1366%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1366,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Aliceah Hernandez pivots around her opponent.

The redshirt junior, part of a three-guard lineup coach Henrickson used Friday, also added seven assists.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While Porter struggled finding her shot against the Lumberjacks, Aliceah Hernandez was feeling it from deep Friday night. The sophomore guard made 5-of-7 attempts from beyond the arc, racking up 15 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game up aggressively, leading 27-21 at the end of the first quarter; however, the Lumberjacks found a way to turn things around before halftime. NAU’s ability to out-rebound the Gauchos 43-38, al while forcing 11 total turnovers were instrumental parts of its effort to stay in the game.</p>\n<p>Additionally, big performances from Lumberjacks Olivia Lucero and Kenna McDavis powered Northern Arizona’s big offensive night. The duo of redshirt seniors combined for 47 points, with Lucero pouring on a game-high 26 to go along with a game-high 11 assists.</p>\n<p>McDavis, a forward, went to work on the glass, grabbing a game-high 13 boards. UCSB scored 18 points in the quarter. With the momentum shifting, the Lumberjacks led 47-45.</p>\n<p>After the break, Santa Barbara regained its composure, stepping it up offensively by utilizing its skilled forward in the paint. The Gauchos fed Edelman in the third quarter, allowing the redshirt senior to score nine in the period as part of a 30-point quarter to regain the lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bench outscored the Lumberjack second rotation 26-14, fueling a comeback of sorts after the lackluster second quarter. With Norther Arizona also having a strong offensive quarter, the 30-point quarter for Santa Barbara only gave the Gauchos a 75-72 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos demonstrated great composure down the stretch Friday, never trailing in the final quarter to the persistent Lumberjacks. Using a clutch three-pointer from Hernandez and free-throws from Bates, the Gauchos held on to win 96-93.</p>\n<p>Despite the win, Santa Barbara got beat in the paint Friday, being outrebounded as mentioned and outscored in the paint 44-36. Notably, UCSB only forced five turnovers and failed to convert any of those turnovers into buckets while the Lumberjacks scored 14 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>While there’s obviously a learning curve one game into the season, it seems the Gauchos have all the pieces for success this year. Some tweaks on defense will need to be made, but the team’s mix of returnees and newcomers such as Bates makes UCSB a tough team to gameplan against.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79658\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79658\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/","id":655,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[654,653,652],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Max Heidegger Sets Career High in UCSB’s Season Opener vs NDSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-13-at-10.11.18-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-13-at-10.11.18-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Excitement filled the T-Dome as Head Coach Joe Pasternack and the Gauchos took on North Dakota State.

To start off, senior forward Leland King II (23 points, 9 rebounds) and senior guard Gabe Vincent (7 points, 8 assists) provided a steady veteran presence for the somewhat jittery Gauchos, scoring or assisting the first nine points of the game.</p>\n<p>It was a heartwarming sight for the Gaucho faithful to see Vincent knock down the first three of the game, and for him to set his career high in assists in his first real game back from last year’s season ending knee injury.</p>\n<p>For NDSU, much of the offensive load was put on senior Paul Miller from the jump. The guard managed to muster up 18 points, five rebounds, and six assists but was hounded by the UCSB defense the entire game and was not really able to get in his comfort zone at any point.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, leading UCSB was Heidegger, who established his presence in the first half with 17 points, making all of his four field goals from beyond the arc while going 5-5 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>At one point, following four straight points by King II, Heidegger knocked down back-to-back three pointers to put UCSB up by ten with two minutes to go.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t too worried about my shot, even when I missed my first three,” Heidegger said. “Because I had to fill in for Marcus [Jackson], I was just trying to get the offense going and let the scoring come to me”.</p>\n<p>He ended with eight three pointers in the game, tied for second most in program history and one shy of the record nine three pointers that former Gaucho Michael Bryson made against Seattle in 2015.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went into halftime up by nine, 40-31, which was mostly the result of a stifling switch heavy defense which forced the Bison into tough shots and passes the whole half.</p>\n<p>For the second half, UCSB remained consistent, as both Heidegger and King II continued to call their own numbers and drained shot after shot giving the Gauchos a 15 point lead five minutes in.</p>\n<p>A major factor for this second half run that both Coach Pasternack and Gabe Vincent pointed out postgame was “winning the rebound war”. In the second half, the Bison only got one offensive rebound, completely cutting out any second chance opportunities.</p>\n<p>The fight and energy that senior forward Jalen Canty brought down to the block definitely had something to do with that.</p>\n<p>The Oakland native did an outstanding job of leveraging his strength against the often taller forwards of NDSU. He was a factor both offensively and defensively, scoring 13 points on 4-8 shooting along with three “And-1” continuation calls, and on the defensive end he had the second most rebounds on the team (four defensive and three offensive).</p>\n<p>Later in the second half, Canty’s ability to score and draw fouls in the post was key to stopping a Bison run which cut the lead to nine at 70-61 following two made free-throws by the Bisons’ Miller.</p>\n<p>Overall, the season opener went down perfectly. Hot shooting from Heidegger and King II kept the game exciting for the crowd, while the gritty Gaucho defense secured the win. The UCSB community is desperate for a great team to rally around, and if this team continues to keep up the defensive intensity, commit to ball movement, fight for every rebound and most importantly “honor the process” as Pasternack would say, then the outlook for UCSB’s season could be promising.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

On the first point, Petrachi’s dig led to a kill by Ruddins, a trend that would be continued throughout the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead, but Irvine battled back, tying the set at nine. UCSB maintained the lead for a majority of the set, but following a five-point run, Irvine was able to cut the deficit to 18-17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a timeout by fifth-year Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, the Gauchos were able to recover their momentum, as freshman middle blocker Nicole Omwanghe spiked the ball straight down. UCSB would never look back, and Ruddins hit from the outside ultimately sealed the set for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second set similarly featured a strong start by the Gauchos, and after an ace by junior setter Lexi Rottman the team jumped out to a 4-1 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We always want to emphasize quick starts,” Lantagne said. “We really wanted to go to the match and not let it come to us. Sometimes as a younger team we wait for a little, and tonight we wanted to go out there and put our best game on the floor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB truly captured the momentum of the set when Rottman stretched out and pancaked the ball, and as the crowd cheered Ruddins recorded a kill to give UCSB a 15-11 lead, a lead they would never relinquish as they jumped out to a 2-0 set advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in the third set, UCSB failed to follow their formula for success from the previous two sets, falling behind early and never fully recovering. While it was able to tie the score twice, it never gained the lead during the set, and Irvine was able to extend the match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth set featured much of the same, as the Gauchos fell behind 5-1 in the beginning of the set. UCSB continued to battle in the set, and after two missed serves from Irvine and an ace by Rottman, Santa Barbara took a 16-15 lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB continued to battle for the rest of the set, but missed serves and hits ultimately doomed the Gauchos. Despite a late four-point rally to pull the score to 24-23, Irvine spiked the ball to generate a fifth, deciding the set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Overall we were playing good volleyball [during those sets], they were just able to go off on runs,”Lantagne said. “ We were winning the other parts of the game, we just needed to manage that better, side out more efficiently, and focus on our execution.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first point in the fifth set, Ruddins slammed the ball straight down, and the team channeled that momentum throughout the rest of the set. Three consecutive kills by Ruddins gave the team an early 5-1 lead in the set. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But perhaps Ruddins most impressive point occurred after a short run by Irvine made the score 13-8. Adjusting to a serve that was pushed too far to the left, Ruddins faded to the left and was able to spike the ball down, deftly avoiding the net as she came down. Sophomore middle blocker Charlie Robinson clinched the victory with a solo block on the next point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got a spark with that early run in the fifth set, and we were able to get [Ruddings] some good looks,” Lantagne said. “Once we got going, the chemistry and confidence were infectious.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday was Ruddins second-career 30 kill effort, following the 36 kills she tallied on August 26th against Florida State.

The midfielder scored six goals for UCSB this year, good for second on the team, and earned a starting spot and leading role for years to come. Her goal total was the most tallied by a freshman within the program’s last two seasons.</p>\n<p>Schornstein and Ball were both selected to the All-Big West First Team, the former making it for the first time while the latter ends her career with two first-team selections.</p>\n<p>The two played vastly different roles but were both vital for the success of the team over the last four years. Schornstein was a defensive stalwart during her time at UCSB and had both the tasks of maintaining the defense and creating the attack. Her ability to do both so well was what led to her starting 75 of 77 possible games in her career.</p>\n<p>Ball, on the other hand, was one of the greatest attacking threats UCSB has ever had, and this year she became the first UCSB player in a decade to score 10 goals or more in consecutive seasons. She led the Big West in goals (10) and points (22) and consistently carried the Gauchos to victory when the team wasn’t playing well as a whole. The impact that these three players had this year was immense; however, the team as a whole still had some setbacks that they will certainly look to address in the offseason.</p>\n<p>One focus for the Gauchos going into next season will be tightening things up on the defensive side of the field. UCSB gave up more goals than all but two other teams in the league this year, tying Cal Poly at 25, which is a statistic that Head Coach Paul Stumpf will surely want to correct going into his 20th season.</p>\n<p>Still, that stat is partially deceiving, as the Gauchos did not give up more than two goals in a game in their last month of play, which shows that they have the potential to become one of the stingiest defenses in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, two glaring questions remain going into next year: Can UCSB maintain consistency on the defensive end for the length of an entire season? And how is it going to fare with two of its best defensive presences in Schornstein and senior defender Kate Shoemaker having already played their last games as Gauchos this past Sunday?</p>\n<p>Another big question is going to be how the Gauchos will replace the offensive production of Ball, who was a huge reason that UCSB ended the season as one of the top offensive teams in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished fourth in the league in goals (24) and third in the league in assists (23), which is a good indicator moving forward that the majority of its goals were a byproduct of good ball movement and passing and not just the result of amazing skill by Ball, who deserves acclaim for her production.</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, one answer to this question of offensive production that the Gauchos will surely be hoping for is the continued improvement of Maurer, following the newcomer’s standout season. Although Ball is leaving some huge shoes to fill, Maurer seems more than capable of taking on a bigger role as she transitions into her second year.</p>\n<p>This last season was rough at times. The Gauchos lost to teams they should have beat and couldn’t put together enough wins to qualify for the postseason.</p>\n<p>Yet, the determination of the players to continue to improve, to play their best defense at the end of the season and ultimately to give it their all every time they were out on the field made it so that even with the losses this season, it could be considered nothing less than a success and a learning experience.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

game out of first place in the Summitt League and made it to the quarter finals in their conference tournament before getting upset by Indiana University—Purdue University Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>In comparison, UCSB only finished 6-22 last year and came in dead last in the Big West, making it the only team to not qualify for the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>It was the first time the team missed the conference tournament since 1998.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Pasternack and fans alike, the team has changed drastically from last year both in terms of new players and just being healthy.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest storylines this year is going to be the return of senior guard Gabe Vincent, who consistently has been the team’s best player since he arrived three years ago.</p>\n<p>How he responds to coming back from a season-ending injury remains to be seen, but the production of the team is definitely going to be linked with his production.</p>\n<p>Last year Vincent led the team in points (295) and points per game (14.8) at the end of the season, even though he missed the last eight games. Despite coming back from injury, the media surrounding the Big West conference still respects Vincent’s game, as he was one of the six athletes named to the All-Big West Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>While he will be better equipped to maintain a high usage rate this year, one of the main focuses of the team is going to have to be looking for increased offensive production from other players to provide a supporting cast.</p>\n<p>Both of the new offseason graduate pickups, Leland King II and Marcus Jackson, will play an integral role in making this happen.</p>\n<p>During King II’s two years at Brown, he averaged 14.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, and while his numbers did drop his last year with Nevada, if he can get them at least closer to what they used to be, he will be a big boost to the Gaucho offense.</p>\n<p>While the forward wasn’t able to provide any scoring in his exhibition game debut going 0-4 from the field in 13 minutes of play, he did rebound well finishing with four, second most for the Gauchos, and defended hard.</p>\n<p>What he lacked offensively was picked up by the other transfer, Marcus Jackson, who scored 14 points on 6-11 shooting in his first game with UCSB.</p>\n<p>Jackson has already played a decorated career at Rice, where he made the second most three-pointers in school history and scored over 1,000 points.</p>\n<p>Adding another veteran presence to the starting lineup will certainly help communication, something that a team that last year ranked in the bottom half of the league in three-pointers given up, points given up and opponent field-goal percentage desperately needs.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Gauchos’ opponent on Saturday, it seems that the bulk of the game plan defensively for UCSB is going to be focused on senior guard Paul Miller.</p>\n<p>Miller led the Bison in three-pointers made (74) and both scoring (501) and points per game (16.7) last year.</p>\n<p>He tallied five assists in NDSU’s exhibition win against Concordia-Moorhead this year and, along with the rest of the Bison offense that scored 74.8 points per game last year, should offer a good first test for the Gaucho defense.</p>\n<p>Miller was also voted to the preseason All-Summit League First Team for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>Another notable returner will be senior combo guard/forward A.J. Jacobson, who shot better than 40 percent from downtown last season and has already tallied over 1,000 points as a Bison, becoming the 33rd in history to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>Unlike last Saturday, the match this weekend will count in all facets, including the team’s record, Pasternack’s overall record and, most importantly, how the fans will see this team.</p>\n<p>For a mid-major program, home crowds are everything, which is something Pasternack has routinely expressed. Wins play a huge factor in that role.<br>\nUCSB faces off against North Dakota State at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 11 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Together, all five newcomers combined for 48 of Santa Barbara’s 78 points it totaled versus East Bay last Saturday.</p>\n<p>While it certainly isn’t a problem to have so many players capable of big contributions, Henrickson will be forced to juggle her talented roster.</p>\n<p>“Comparing last year, we’ve improved the depth in our program. We’re [still] going to bank on our returners, and we have certainly relied on them and will continue to rely on them to get the young people … more comfortable every day as far as how we play and the style of play,” Hendrickson said. “Will we rely on our returners? Yes. Will the young players in our program get opportunities? Absolutely.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79606\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1381518073\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79608\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79606\" data-attachment-id=\"79606\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/m-and-w-bball-opener/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"m and w bball opener\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79606\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener-683x1024.png?resize=800%2C1200\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79606\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Following Saturday’s exhibition win, Henrickson admitted she might have been worried starting three freshmen in years past, but her high praise for her newcomers grants the Gauchos some flexibility.</p>\n<p>With senior Drew Edelman and sophomore Natalia Bruening sitting out due to minor injuries, Santa Barbara seems to have the luxury of not rushing their returns.</p>\n<p>Edelman, who played for Team USA over the summer for the Maccabi Games in Israel, is looking to bring that experience back to UCSB in a positive way for the Gauchos when she returns to action for the season opener.</p>\n<p>The 6’4” redshirt senior not only played in the Maccabi Games, but she also was a key component in the U.S. winning gold at the event, recording a dominant 29 points and 19 boards in the championship game over Israel.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Edelman will be a big part of Santa Barbara’s season this year if she can manage to put up even half those numbers consistently.</p>\n<p>“[Edelman]’s just in better shape and stronger than she was last year,” Henrickson explained, “and now she’s as strong as she’s been in the last couple years.”</p>\n<p>After proving that they can effectively utilize a small-ball lineup, the Gauchos only become more threatening with the anticipated return of Edelman and Bruening.</p>\n<p>Bruening, also 6’4”, plays center and will free up Akilah Jennings of her duties at the five, allowing Santa Barbara more length and versatility on the perimeter when she returns.</p>\n<p>However, for Henrickson, Sahar has definitely been one of the key players to watch.</p>\n<p>Before transferring to UCSB, Sahar spent a season at Seattle University, where she averaged a slash line of 10.2/3.9/1.7 while even dropping a career-high 23 points against Big West foe UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>At Seattle, the Tarzana native’s deadliest weapon was her three-point game.<br>\nIn her freshman season, she was the team’s best, averaging 38.2 percent from beyond the arc and nailing 68 threes, 23 more than the second most on the team.</p>\n<p>“She can shoot the three, and she’s at the right place for that because we can get her uncontested shots. She gives us added weapons from the three-point line,” Henrickson said. “Tal’s big enough, long enough to play a four and defend a four, so it gives us some size on the glass, too. And that’s what we need our big wings to do; they’ve got to rebound the ball better.”</p>\n<p>The Coach Bonnie era is in full swing for Santa Barbara; however, for Northern Arizona, their new era has just begun, starting with the signing of a new head coach, Loree Payne.</p>\n<p>Payne previously led a successful seven-year coaching campaign at Puget Sound that saw her winning just under 70 percent of games in both conference and regular-season play.</p>\n<p>The Lumberjacks under Payne are looking to move in a new direction, having 10 newcomers to the team. The rebuilding effort of Northern Arizona will be a process, as the Lumberjacks finished with just six wins last season.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup will feature plenty of newcomers from both teams, as well as ambitious coaches in Henrickson and Payne looking to guide their programs to an opening win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on NAU on Friday, Nov. 10, with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A

For a team with nine underclassmen, that’s a big deal.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have a chance to showcase its continued development and maybe pick up a couple wins this weekend. Santa Barbara will play host to UC Irvine on Friday and then UC Davis on Saturday for Senior Night during its final home matches of the season.</p>\n<p>The two consecutive losses have knocked the Gauchos (6-17, 5-6) down to fifth in the Big West standings, directly behind the two teams they’ll play this weekend. Just two wins in the Thunderdome, and UCSB will likely find itself back in the top half of the conference.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine (21-4, 9-3) sits in third place in the Big West, three and a half games ahead of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Five Anteaters have triple-digit kills so far this season, but no attacker has more than 300. It’s a balanced attack, coordinated primarily by junior setter Ali Koumelis and her 883 assists.</p>\n<p>“I expect to see a diverse and balanced offense,” Lantagne Welch said. “They have been getting solid production across the board with their experienced outside, their lefty right-side, and they have a really quick attacking middle.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine has won its last two games, both 3-0 decisions, against Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside. Three games back from Cal Poly, the Anteaters have an outside chance of grabbing a conference championship but must first find a way to overcome the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Following Friday, UC Davis comes to town for UCSB’s Senior Night. The Aggies are 15-11 overall and 7-6 in the Big West, directly above the Gauchos.<br>\nUCSB took down the Aggies while on the road back on Oct. 17, but that was a different UC Davis team. UCD has won its last four matches and will look to give Cal Poly its first conference loss the night before it visits Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We can take the things we did well [in the first match against UCD], the confidence that we prevailed and, of course, the things that were a little off to improve this time around,” Lantagne Welch said. “Davis is a better team this time around, but definitely we are better now, too.”</p>\n<p>Saturday night’s match will be preceded by a Senior Night ceremony for UCSB’s two seniors, defensive specialist Sydney Bast and outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. Bast and Hoffman have served as the Gauchos’ veterans throughout this up-and-down season and earned high praise from their head coach.</p>\n<p>“Chanel and Syd are first, and most importantly, great people,” Lantagne Welch said. “They are people you just want to be around. They are my first two recruits ever here at UCSB and have embraced their roles as leaders on this team. They speak up and share experiences and bring extra to the team every day. They truly put the team before themselves, and it has helped the team all year long.”</p>\n<p>Playing in their last-ever home matches as Gauchos, Bast and Hoffman will be motivated to finish strong. Their teammates will be similarly motivated to send their seniors out on top, which could prove to be key on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The team will want to give everything they have for Chanel and Syd,” Lantagne Welch said. “They are a huge part of this program and you just want to put everything out on the floor for them.”<br>\nThe underclassmen have been the focus of this season, but it is those preparing to end their time as Gauchos who will have the spotlight this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UCI Friday, Nov. 10, and UC Davis Saturday, Nov. 11. Both matches will take place at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/","id":4962,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4961,4960,4959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Fall Short in Mustang Territory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This season's second installment of the Blue-Green rivalry ended with UCSB experiencing some inconsistencies while on the road.

UCSB led 19-15 late in the first set, but the Mustangs (22-2, 12-0) snatched what would have been a crucial victory away with a 12-6 run, winning the set 27-25 in extra points.</p>\n<p>Stung by the painful first-set defeat, the Gauchos flew out of the gate again in the second set with an 8-1 run. Cal Poly once again battled back, closing the gap at 17-17 and later took a 24-21 lead with a chance to win the set and likely control the match.</p>\n<p>Three straight Gaucho points staved off a potential second set loss, however, and another three-point run a little later was capped off with a Lindsey Ruddins kill that allowed UCSB to knot the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Ruddins, as usual, was the Gauchos’ leading attacker. The sophomore outside hitter posted 26 kills, and added nine digs and four blocks to balance out her statline.</p>\n<p>The final two sets of the matchup were about as tight as the first two. They just didn’t happen to work in UCSB’s favor either time.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held a late 19-18 lead after seesawing back and forth with the Mustangs for most of the third set, but that was as good as it got for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly took the next five points in a row, mostly on attack errors by UCSB, and finally won the set 25-21 to crack open a 2-1 lead in the match.</p>\n<p>That third set was the Gauchos’ worst offensively. They hit a match-low .189 for 14 kills. Their late errors were what allowed Cal Poly to surge late, a disappointing result for UCSB after leading for most of the set.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, the fourth set looked remarkably similar to the first and third sets. Just as in those earlier periods, the Mustangs won on the strength of a scoring stretch after the Gauchos started hot.</p>\n<p>This time around, UCSB didn’t trail until a Raeann Greisen kill gave Cal Poly a 15-14 lead. Once the Mustangs had the lead, they didn’t give it back up.</p>\n<p>A five-point run pushed the hosts out to a 23-16 lead, large enough to sweat out the Gauchos’ 7-2 run to close out the set and take the match.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was UCSB’s best on the attack, as they hit .289 and posted 16 kills. Cal Poly just happened to be better, with a hitting percentage of .366 and 19 kills.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Charlie Robinson was second on UCSB with 12 kills, her best attacking effort since the team’s Sept. 29 match against CSUN. Robinson’s five total blocks was a team-best, just ahead of freshman middle blocker Nicole Omwanghe and Annie Hasselmann.</p>\n<p>Hasselmann, as UCSB’s setter, had one of her best games of the season. The junior had 54 assists and nine digs to go with her four total blocks.</p>\n<p>Four different Mustangs finished with more than ten kills, a balanced attack that UCSB was simply unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>Torrey Van Winden was the leader with 20 kills, but her sister Adlee was close behind with 13 of her own, giving the family a very strong night on the attack.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home this coming weekend with two games in the Thunderdome at 7 pm, the first against UC Irvine on Friday and the second against UC Davis on Saturday for Senior Night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/","id":4961,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4960,4959,4958],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Don’t Miss a Beat in Exhibition Rout of Fresno Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-07-at-10.15.27-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-07-at-10.15.27-AM.png?resize=783%2C448&ssl=1","description":"It came.

He provided a lot of energy to start off the game however, fighting for position and rebounding the ball while making the extra pass, which was enough to get by as Heidegger came out and took over the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Heidegger jumpstarted the Gaucho offense with his aggressiveness in the first quarter, scoring the team’s first seven points, tying his points per game average of last year in the first two minutes of the game. This gave UCSB an early 7-3 lead.</p>\n<p>His great three point shooting paved the way for the team’s forwards and remaining guards to slash to the paint, and played a huge role in the 46-29 lead the Gauchos took into the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played great basketball in the first twenty minutes. Having the focus to limit turnovers in an exhibition game is very difficult to do, and going into halftime the players had not only been very stingy with turnovers (coughing up 4 to Fresno’s 13) but also managed to shake the rust off and shoot 52.6 % from the field.</p>\n<p>Other notable events that happened in the first half were the first points of the year for both Marcus Jackson and Gabe Vincent. Vincent getting a steal and layup in the first five minutes of the game was surely a heartwarming sight for many fans after his season ending knee injury last year.</p>\n<p>The senior, who despite missing the last eight games of the season still led the team in points (295) and points per game (14.8), is surely looking to make his presence be felt once again as one of the top players in the Big West this year.</p>\n<p>Marcus Jackson made his swiss army knife status be known early in this game, recording a steal, rebound, assist, and layup all in the first two minutes of the game. The Rice University transfer looks to bring a veteran mentality to the team, as he already had one of the most accomplished careers at his previous school.</p>\n<p>He finished the first half with 12 points on 5-9 shooting, and didn’t need to play much of the second half because of the gap that he helped create.</p>\n<p>The second half mostly consisted of building on the already expansive lead for UCSB. To the team’s credit they did manage to do that, however some of the negative signs of an exhibition game blowout began to seep in as the Gauchos turned the ball over more than twice as many times in the second half as they did in the first (10 to 4).</p>\n<p>Again, it was Heidegger who pulled through for the Gauchos, knocking in 11 second half points and not letting any Fresno Pacific run start.</p>\n<p>Another major contributor in the second half was Clifton Powell, who scored seven points on 2-3 shooting from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>If the sophomore guard is able to continually shoot high percentages from behind the three point line, then his role within the offense should take a big leap from last year, especially because his length and height give him the capability to be one of the most versatile defenders on the team.</p>\n<p>Overall, the exhibition game provided a lot of positives for the Gauchos. Although it was against a clearly under matched opponent, the team was able to incorporate its new players and system very well and look to have a deadly offense going forward.</p>\n<p>Remaining healthy and eligible will surely guarantee a better year than last season, and could lead to the Gauchos making some big strides.</p>\n<p>UCSB kicks off its season in the Thunderdome against North Dakota State on Saturday November 11 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

They are now 9-11 on the year, 0-4 in GCC play while Pacific improves to 15-5 on the year and a perfect 4-0 conference record.</p>\n<p>Play began in the first quarter where the Tigers wasted no time opening up the scoring after freshman Luke Pavillard scored within the first two minute, giving Pacific the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the final 30 seconds of the first, it was both the Gauchos and Tigers putting up some points on the board. Senior Shane Hauschild gave UCSB their first point of the match on a powerplay goal good for his 29th goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Tiger Engin Ege Colak was able to answer back with three seconds left, scoring a goal for the 3-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Hauschild answered back again two seconds later scoring his second goal of the night and only leaving the Gauchos one point behind the Tigers 3-2 at the end of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>After giving up the lead early into the second quarter, Pacific went on to dominate the rest of the period.</p>\n<p>The Tigers were able to score five unanswered goals as the team was able to take control both offensively and defensively as the team did not give up a goal since scoring in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge for Pacific was redshirt senior Ben Stevenson who had two goals and two assists in the second, giving his team the lead at halftime, 8-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to close the deficit to just three goals in the third quarter, but it appeared to be too little, too late as Pacific was able to slowly inch away from the Gauchos during the match, ending the third period still ahead five, 11-6.</p>\n<p>Scoring the Gauchos only goal of the fourth quarter was freshman Chad Nelson and the team went on to lose 14-7.</p>\n<p>The short-handed effort from the Gauchos has been admirable as the team has been able to play well despite the indication from the record, Coach Wigo is certainly hoping to get some of those players back into the pool and playing with his star attacker.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are hoping for a similar result in their upcoming match against Pepperdine next Friday, where the team could possibly pick up their first conference win.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead next week, the team needs a win next week against Pepperdine, the team that bounced the Gauchos out early from the Golden Coast Conference Championships last season should give the team some much-needed success headed into the conference tournament which begins play November 17th.</p>\n<p>“The guys are motivated and team morale is still good, the guys are fighting. We know anything can happen in the tournament and we just want to get some momentum next week and get a good game against Pepperdine so we could feel good about ourselves headed into the tournament,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>The No. 10 UCSB Gauchos will play the No. 8 Pepperdine Waves on the road at 7 PM PST on November 10th.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79529\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79529\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/","id":4889,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4888,4887,4886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set Tone in Exhibition Win Over CSU East Bay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wbb.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wbb.png?resize=707%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Eager to show off their new additions, the UCSB women's basketball team rolled over Cal State East Bay in its exhibition opener, 78-63.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team defeated Cal State East Bay in its exhibition opener Saturday night by a final score of 78-63.</p>\n<p>Although third-year Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson didn’t have a some of her more experienced players due to various minor injuries, a small-ball lineup featuring three freshmen brought the Gauchos energy and an array of scoring early in the game.</p>\n<p>“Good thing it was fun,” Henrickson said. “We did some good things, [there are] plenty of opportunities to grow and learn on film.

Their hot start would prove to be just that, as the Gauchos finished shooting 45.2 percent (28-62) on the night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scoring presence also came from the three-point line, as Bates herself knocked down two threes and newcomer Tal Sahar hit four threes as part of her promising 14-point debut for UCSB. Ultimately, Santa Barbara put up 27 three-point attempts, converting on 10 to go 37 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“It felt really good, it was really nerve-wracking, you don’t play for 365 days you don’t really know how it’s going to go”, Tal explained, “But it felt really good and everyone worked really hard in practice [so] the pace didn’t really phase me as much as I thought it would.”</p>\n<p>Sahar, who sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, showed confidence on both ends of the court and the ability to create her own shot off the dribble. Also, the 5’11 redshirt sophomore will clearly be a perimeter threat to opposing teams, forcing them to respect Sahar’s range.</p>\n<p>And when the Pioneers caught on to Sahar’s ability to easily knock down the three, the athletic guard showed a high basketball IQ in avoiding pressure, swinging the ball to get the easy bucket.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter contributed seven points on an off-night shooting, going just 2-8 and 1-6 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Senior Makala Roper used an energetic stretch in the latter part of the game to score a quick 12 points for her team.</p>\n<p>Akilah Jennings finished with 13 points and 6 boards for Santa Barbara, and fellow Gauchos Radford and Chaya Durr added a handful of buckets.</p>\n<p>Durr, a 6-foot forward, did a little bit of everything for the Gauchos, recording a team-high seven rebounds in addition to 8 points and 3 steals. The senior brought a competitive attitude and posted her diverse stat-line in only 20 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Despite a slow first half in which they only scored 22 points, the East Bay Pioneers used a game-high 25 point performance from sophomore Morgan Greene to get their offense rolling in the second half.</p>\n<p>Outscoring Santa Barbara 41-38 in the second half, East Bay controlled the boards during stretches, earning 15 points off second-chance efforts.</p>\n<p>Greene led the Pioneers with not only points but rebounds, pulling down a game-high 14 boards (6 of which were offensive).</p>\n<p>East Bay’s strong second half kept the Gauchos on their toes, but it wasn’t enough to pull off an upset, as the garbage time of the fourth quarter featured an array of bad passes, missed layups and simple turnovers from both teams.</p>\n<p>The game concluded with UCSB dribbling out the clock, and the Pioneers falling to the Gauchos in the Thunderdome. East Bay shot roughly 35 percent (23-66) from the field to go with a sub-par 26.3 percent (5-19) shooting effort from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“There’s a maturity about them, they come to work every day with a maturity and sense of urgency,” Henrickson said. “They’re silly and goofy off [the court], but when we’re between the lines they want to get it right, they want to be good, they expect to be successful, they expect to work to be successful. I think for us to play a pretty good flow and rhythm, considering so many new people… that was good.”</p>\n<p>Following the game, Coach Bonnie, Sahar, and Jennings addressed an excited group in the Founder’s Room of the Thunderdome, pointing to the revived culture of basketball Henrickson has brought to Santa Barbara in her 3rd year at the helm of the program.</p>\n<p>With plenty of energy and expectations surrounding them this year, the Gauchos will travel to open their season against Northern Arizona this Friday, November 10 at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79535\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79535\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/","id":598,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[597,596,595],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":43,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
