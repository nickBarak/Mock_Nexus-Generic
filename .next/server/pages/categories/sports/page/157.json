The Gauchos got off to a horrible start, turning the ball over six times in their first nine possessions. As a result, the Titans took an early 9-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled offensively, failing to score until there were just under 12 minutes left in the first half, and as a result entered halftime down 23-16. The 16-point half was the Gauchos’ worst start to a game this season.</p>\n<p>To open the second half, Santa Barbara finally began to climb back into the game. Two free throws from junior guard Nicole Nesbit brought the score within three at 27-24, but the Titans responded with a 7-0 run to extend their lead back to 10 points. However, Santa Barbara continued to fight, closing the gap to four points with four minutes to go.</p>\n<p>While Fullerton left the door open for UCSB, the Gauchos were unable to take advantage of their many opportunities to win the game. After coming within four, the Titans turned the ball over. However, Santa Barbara returned the favor. The Titans then missed on the front end of a one-and-one opportunity, but UCSB gave the ball back to Fullerton once again with an offensive foul.</p>\n<p>Unable to make a shot that would bring the Gauchos within one possession, Fullerton eventually took advantage. Down the stretch, the Titans went seven for eight from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Despite outshooting the Titans 32.6 percent to 24.4 percent, UCSB sent Fullerton to the free throw line 25 times. The Titans converted their opportunities, shooting 84.0 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Nesbit was the only player for the Gauchos with more than six points, tallying a game-high. For Fullerton, sophomore guard Chante Miles and junior guard Alex Thomas paced the team tallying 11 points each.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to forget about tonight’s loss as it travels to UC Riverside Saturday. At 11-15 overall and 4-11 in the Big West, the Highlanders have lost five straight; however the last time these two teams played, Riverside upset the Gauchos 45-42.</p>\n<p>UCSB turned the ball over 17 times leading to a 20-6 points off turnovers advantage for Riverside. Junior center Natasha Hadley dominated down low, scoring 20 points and giving the Highlanders a 20-6 advantage in the paint.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, their lead was just two with under a minute remaining. Nesbit drew a foul, but made just one of her free throws, exhibiting the Gaucho’s horrible night from the charity stripe as they shot 56.2 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>While Hadley gave the Gauchos fits in the last matchup, senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham has made her mark on the conference as the strongest offensive threat, leading the Big West in points per game with 18.2.</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50436\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50436\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/","id":649,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[648,647,646],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face San Jose State at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team continues its nine-game homestand today by welcoming San Jose State to Southern California for a three-game series.

After leading 1-0 through five innings, the Dons put up a single run in the sixth to tie the score and then scored a run in the eighth to take the lead, which would be enough for the win.</p>\n<p>Losing late leads has become a trend recently for SJSU. In two games against Arizona, the Spartans held late leads but fell after some shaky relief pitching. They had a three-run lead into the seventh inning Sunday before a five-run inning followed by a four-run inning in the eighth all but put them away. On Friday they again held a lead, this time all the way to the bottom of the ninth, but a two out error led to a three run triple to cap the win for Arizona.</p>\n<p>“[San Jose] has played some tough people and have played on the road,” Checketts said. “Arizona is a tough place to go out and win and they had a lead in two of those games before they lost them late, so they will be competitive and have a chip on their shoulder.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have seen their fair share of pitching woes this early season as well. On Tuesday afternoon, a combination of three relief pitchers in the sixth inning gave up seven runs allowing UCLA to run away with the game.</p>\n<p>“There have been some freshmen that have been a little out of character,” Checketts said. “Our freshmen came in and struggled quite a bit. There were some growing pains. We would like them to grow a little faster and get through that, but I think they will bounce back and learn from it and be more prepared and tougher because of it.”</p>\n<p>One constant this year, however, has been solid starting pitching from sophomore Austin Pettibone. Friday afternoon’s scheduled starter heads into the weekend with a 1-0 record and a 0.67 earned run average in his two starts. Fellow starter sophomore Andrew Vasquez has struck out 11 through his nine innings of work and holds opponents to a .156 batting average against.</p>\n<p>At the plate, the Gauchos are led by sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who just had his seven-game hitting streak ended Tuesday. Kuresa, along with junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon, sophomore outfielder Luke Swenson and sophomore third baseman Peter Maris lead the team with six RBI each. The timely hitting by each player has helped to stabilize a lineup that is without its everyday third baseman in Venning.</p>\n<p>The weekend series begins today at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/","id":4501,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4500,4499,4498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to Hawaii Looking to End Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The moments that define a young basketball team are how it responds in the face of adversity.

We’ve just got to come together in times like this and push it the rest of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB previously dropped a 51-50 decision to Sacramento State in the BracketBusters game and must now return to conference play against the third place Warriors. Santa Barbara sits in eighth place in the conference standings, a mere half game ahead of Cal State Northridge for the final slot in the postseason tournament.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, meanwhile, is coming off an 84-50 victory over Northern Arizona that snapped a two-game skid. The last time these two teams met in Santa Barbara, junior forward Christian Standhardinger went off for career-highs with 31 points and 16 rebounds in a 78-73 Hawaii victory.</p>\n<p>“We definitely can’t let him get off,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve got to do a better job on all their guys inside. We got our rear ends handed to us inside on the glass and we have to fight harder, block out better, and be more physical in keeping them off the glass.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will potentially be without one of its top scorers in junior guard Kyle Boswell, who is sitting out with an injured shoulder. Sophomore center Alan Williams, the team’s leading scorer, rebounder and shot blocker has also only played in two games since returning from a sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have to see how we come out and play and practice,” Coach Williams said. “It was actually kind of impressive after a nine hour travel day they came out and practiced really well. Practice was good, they were feisty, they were competitive; things we want to see.”</p>\n<p>Practice may have been a little too feisty though, as Brown cracked his nose during Tuesday’s practice in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I’m definitely in some pain right now,” Brown said. “I’m going to have to wear a mask tomorrow in the game, but I can’t let it hold me back, I’ve got to keep going. At this point we don’t think I broke my nose.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara struggles to rebound from a slow season and tries to clinch a spot in the postseason tournament, maybe a trip to Hawaii is exactly what the Gauchos needed to get them back on track.</p>\n<p>“I like the idea of coming out to Hawaii, getting a smile on our faces and just getting some positive energy,” Brown said. “I think that’s a big thing we need right now with this type of season.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50404\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50404\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/","id":650,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[649,648,647],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go For 41st Straight Over CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After continuing its streak against Northridge last Saturday, winning its 13th straight against the Matadors, the UCSB women’s basketball team has another winning streak to defend tonight when the t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After continuing its streak against Northridge last Saturday, winning its 13th straight against the Matadors, the UCSB women’s basketball team has another winning streak to defend tonight when the team tries for its 41st consecutive victory over Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Dating back to the 1995-96 season, the win streak is the second best nationwide, trailing only Stanford’s 53 straight victories over Washington State.

Nevertheless, UCSB knows it cannot take any team for granted.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like we are going in to this game undefeated,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Our kids understand that different teams present different problems and we had our hands full with Fullerton last time, so there’s absolutely no reason to overlook them.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met in the Thunderdome, UCSB took an early lead, but gave it up in the second half. With the score knotted up at 40, Mitchell made a five man line change, subbing in the reserves. They finished the game on a 12-4 run and earned UCSB a 60-50 win.</p>\n<p>“We got complacent going into the second half,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “That [can’t] happen, especially at the end of the season. Every team is vying for that spot at the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, a glaring statistic for the Gauchos was rebounding as the Titans outrebounded Santa Barbara 40-30, including 20-4 on the offensive glass, which resulted in 23 second chance points for Fullerton compared to just four for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Therefore, rebounding will most likely be the biggest key to the game for the Gauchos. The Titans rank third in the Big West in rebounding margin at +1.6 and lead the conference in offensive boards with 17.9 per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB features two of the best rebounders in the conference as senior forward Sweets Underwood ranks fourth in the league with 9.4 rebounds per game and Tilleman ranks ninth with 7.1.</p>\n<p>Tilleman and Underwood will be crucial for the Gauchos inside offensively as well, as Fullerton is a smaller team known for its quick guards.

After a leadoff walk, freshman second baseman Trent Chatterton faked a bunt and pulled back for a swing to hit a single. After a sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third, a ground ball to shortstop by junior centerfielder Brian Carroll scored the first run of the game. Carroll’s RBI was followed by an RBI double by sophomore third baseman Kevin Kramer.</p>\n<p>In the top of the fifth inning, UCLA went back to the same formula to manufacture two more runs. The Gauchos responded with two runs of their own in the bottom of the fifth inning. Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward led the inning off by reaching base after being hit by a pitch. He advanced to second on a ground ball and scored on a single by sophomore left fielder Luke Swenson. Swenson advanced to second on a groundout and scored when junior catcher Jackson Morrow grounded a 0-2 pitch to the second baseman Chatterton, who let the ball get through his legs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the sixth, the Bruins ran away with the game, scoring seven runs on four hits and an error by Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Freshman Kenny Chapman replaced Mahle and quickly loaded the bases without recording an out. Freshman Domenic Mazza then came out of the bullpen to pick up for Chapman. Mazza fielded a grounder and recorded the out by going to the plate with the ball, but Morrow was unable to turn two after the runner’s slide disrupted his throw.</p>\n<p>Moore then doubled down the right field line driving in two runs. Head Coach Andrew Checketts again went to his bullpen, bringing on freshman Connor Baits. Baits was touched up by Chatterton with an RBI single and a two-run double off the bat of Filia. After a walk and hit batter, a sac fly to center field turned into two runs when the throw got away from Morrow and Baits.</p>\n<p>“Mahle gave us a competitive start, but the guys after that did not give us a chance,” Checketts said. “We are going to have to go back to the drawing board and figure out what was going on, but frankly it was embarrassing the way the young guys responded.”</p>\n<p>Both teams would go on to score another run apiece leading to the final score of 12-3 after several players replaced the starters by the end of the game.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is another home weekend series against San Jose State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Photo by Mark Brocher / Daily Nexus</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/","id":4503,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4502,4501,4500],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Like Father, Like Daughter","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_WBasketball_011013-121.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_WBasketball_011013-121.jpg?resize=550%2C647&ssl=1","description":"You could say that basketball is in Angelei Aguirre’s blood.

Whether that was basketball or something else, he was really supportive.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Angelei did turn to basketball and when she did, her dad was there.</p>\n<p>“He’d take me to work out all the time or we’d talk after games about what I could’ve done better — the typical coach because he was coaching most of the time while I was playing basketball,” Angelei said.</p>\n<p>Through it all, though, it wasn’t Dad that she inspired to be, instead wanting to be her own player. And that she certainly is. At first glance at their personas on the court, it’s impossible to tell that Angelei and Mark are related.</p>\n<p>“Our games are totally different,” Mark said. “She’s more like my friend Magic (Johnson) than she is like me. “</p>\n<p>Angelei is most known for her defense. At 5’11’’, the senior guard can provide a tall, long presence against a guard or can body up down low. She often has the responsibility of guarding the opponent’s best player.</p>\n<p>With 0.7 blocks per game, Angelei is tied for first on the team. She also ranks third on the squad, and is the No. 1 guard in rebounding, averaging 3.8 per game.</p>\n<p>“It’s just that blue-collar mentality,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “She has that god-given athletic ability, but also on most teams that she’s played on has been willing to take the back seat to do all the dirty things.”</p>\n<p>Mark, on the other hand, was first and foremost a scorer. Over his 13-year career, Mark averaged 20.0 points per game and during the 1983-84 campaign, he averaged 29.5 points per game, second in the NBA. As the Dallas Mavericks’ main weapon, Mark was a physical player, earning a lot of his baskets in the paint.</p>\n<p>“I don’t remember watching him play in person, but I’ve seen a lot of film,” Angelei said. “He was a great shooter. He was a bruiser; he was a banger. He knew how to use his body well to get his shot off over his bigger opponents.”</p>\n<p>While Mark played the forward position, Angelei is an extremely versatile player, playing all positions for UCSB, from the point guard to the post.</p>\n<p>“I think it goes back to winning,” Mark said. “If you want to win, you’ll do whatever it takes. That means being a good defender, being able to pass the ball and play any position a coach puts you in. She’s really worked at being a complete basketball player and that’s what came out is that she’s able to play all positions.”</p>\n<p>According to Mark, this may be possible due to her high basketball IQ, which comes from the fact that Angelei has been around basketball for so long.</p>\n<p>“After you see something so much, you have an early knowledge of it,” Mark said. “When you’re talking that kind of lingo, it rubs off on you.”</p>\n<p>On offense, Angelei is a pass-first, score-second type of player; she averages 1.7 assists per game, which is third on the team.</p>\n<p>“You can only be a passer if you’re a shooter because people can’t double off of you,” Mitchell said. “People know she can knock down that 15-foot shot. They know she’ll take it off the dribble, so that allows her to be a better passer.”</p>\n<p>While very different from Mark, Angelei’s unselfish offensive mentality may stem from working out with her dad. If there was one piece of advice he wanted to give Angelei growing up, it was how to respect the game.</p>\n<p>“When I say respect the game, it’s the fact that it’s more than about you,” Mark said. “You can’t say I want to play, but not be committed to being at practice, working hard, trying to be a teammate, trying to make yourself better and trying to make your teammates better.”</p>\n<p>Described by both her dad and coach as the “ultimate teammate,” Angelei only scores when her team really needs her to, tallying 5.7 points per game, although she averages an impressive 46.6 percent from the field in conference play.</p>\n<p>Angelei’s biggest scoring nights, in fact, have come when her team’s back is against the wall. For example, against USC, Angelei put the team on her back in the second half to get her team back in the game, scoring a career-high 13 points.</p>\n<p>“I do what I need to do for the team to win,” Angelei said. “I try to let the game come to me and take what the defense will give me. If I have an open shot, I’ll take it, but I don’t go out of my way.”</p>\n<p>Yet, despite how quickly Angelei and Mark are to say how little they have in common as players, it’s hard not to notice a few similarities.</p>\n<p>For one, Angelei wears number 24 for UCSB, the same number her dad wore in college at DePaul and for Dallas.</p>\n<p>In addition, both have proven they can win. Mark has a couple titles to his name, winning back-to-back NBA championships with the Detroit Pistons.</p>\n<p>Angelei has also won several championships, the most recent coming last year when UCSB earned its Big West Tournament Championship crown. In fact, Angelei was one of the main players Mitchell credited as playing a major role in the victory. In the championship, Angelei recorded what, at the time, was her career-high with nine points and tied her career-high in rebounds with seven.</p>\n<p>“She was just coming back (from an injury) and working her way back into shape,” Mitchell said. “We were able to utilize her at that four spot, which opened it up for Tilleman and Sweets on the inside.”</p>\n<p>Throughout her career, Angelei has proven she can win at every level. In high school, she led her team to four straight Section 1-AA championships. As a Gaucho, along with last year’s tournament championship crown, Santa Barbara won the Big West regular season title in 2010-11 in Angelei’s first season in a UCSB uniform.</p>\n<p>“She’s always won, no matter what team she’s been on,” Mark said. “She’s what basketball should be. You go out there with four other people and you’re trying to win the game. That’s the way she plays.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Photo by Magali Gaulthier / Daily Nexus</h6>\n<h6>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of February 27th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50384\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50384\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/","id":642,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[641,640,639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to No. 7 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Coming in with a road victory under its belt for the first time this season, the UCSB men’s volleyball team looks to keep its momentum going tonight when it travels to No. 7 UCLA.

Santa Barbara won its first road game of the season last week against USC to snap a four-game skid, and despite still being 1-7 on the road, the Gauchos are fully prepared to enter the John Wooden Center now that each game bares postseason implications.</p>\n<p>“It’s always fun to go to another team’s house and take it to them, and show we’re not where we should be in the standings,” senior middle blocker Dylan Davis said. “We can handle any team we play against.”</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB not being short of confidence, the Bruins enter with plenty of momentum themselves after sweeping two conference opponents in dominating fashion last week. With a record of 11-8 overall and 7-6 in the MPSF, the Bruins handed Pepperdine its first home loss of the season after compiling a season-high .522 hitting percentage to defeat USC as well.</p>\n<p>In the first game between these two teams, the Bruins capitalized on key substitutions made after the second set to overcome a 0-2 deficit and steal a tough five-set match away from the Gauchos. UCLA again came out victorious in its second meeting of the season, defeating Santa Barbara handily in four sets back in January.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB has risen to the occasion when up against high caliber teams in the MPSF this year, taking many of its opponents down to the wire.</p>\n<p>“We know that we can beat any team in our league because we’ve been playing with the top teams really close,” Evans said. “We’re really stoked because we want to show we can beat them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to be alert when the Bruins serve as UCLA is first in the league in service aces per set with 1.52. More importantly, the Gauchos will have to keep focus as the game progresses and limit their errors in crucial situations.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/ucsb-travels-to-no-7-ucla/","id":5330,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5329,5328,5327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"World Baseball Classic: MLB’s Friend or Foe?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tired of watching meaningless spring training baseball games?

Me too. Good thing the 2013 World Baseball Classic begins this weekend. The first WBC was held in 2006 and was played every three years until 2009, when it switched to every four years. It was created in response to baseball being voted out of the Olympics in 2005.<br>\nThe WBC is a great event because it spreads the game of baseball to other parts of the world, gives the fans a chance to see great players who do not play in the MLB already and also gives the players the opportunity to represent their home countries. For example, the baseball world was largely unaware of players like Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish and Yoenis Cespedes until they were lighting up the WBC. Now they are all playing and succeeding in the MLB.<br>\nHowever, the WBC does have one big flaw. When baseball was an Olympic sport, only amateur players could participate. The WBC, on the other hand, has no restrictions on who can play. Here lies the predicament: If you were an owner of a MLB franchise, would you want one of your star players playing and possibly getting hurt in the WBC? You are paying this player a lot of money to win games and fill the seats at your stadium, not to play in an international tournament that has no bearing on the MLB season. Take the Milwaukee Brewers for example. They are sending 13 of their players to various teams in the WBC including their big league catcher Jonathan Lucroy, ace starting pitcher Yovani Gallardo and former MVP outfielder Ryan Braun. If those players come back worn out or injured, then their season and their financial investments would be in serious jeopardy.<br>\nIn the last two WBC tournaments, the extra games have had the most negative effects on the pitchers. At this time in Spring Training, the pitchers are beginning their throwing routines and side bullpen sessions in preparation for the upcoming season. The WBC, however, requires the pitchers to go out and pitch in real games with maximum effort when they would normally be easing into the heavy workload. This can cause strain and fatigue on a pitcher’s arm, which is exactly what all of the MLB teams who are signing the players’ paychecks do not want.<br>\nLooking at the groups, Pool A consists of Cuba, Japan, Brazil and China. Brazil and China are not big baseball countries so Cuba and Japan are pretty safe. Japan has won both of the previous two tournaments and Cuba always has a few star players who will eventually play in the MLB. Pool B is made up by Australia, Chinese Taipei, Korea and the Netherlands. Look for Korea to easily advance followed by a struggle for the second spot.<br>\nPool C is considered the power pool with the likes of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Spain and Venezuela. The Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Puerto Rico all feature multiple major league stars like Robinson Cano, Carlos Beltran, Hanley Ramirez, Yadier Molina, Miguel Cabrera, Pablo Sandoval and many others.<br>\nThen there is Pool D with Canada, Italy, Mexico and the United States. The U.S. should easily win this pool followed by either Mexico or Canada. Groups A and B will begin pool play on March 2 followed by groups C and D starting on March 7.<br>\nThe top two teams from each group will advance to the second round, which will be held at the Marlins’ stadium in Miami and at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. The top four teams will then advance to the championship round hosted at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco.<br>\nHopefully the U.S. can bring the title home and back to the birthplace of baseball. But before you ask why the U.S. roster does not include every great American player like Justin Verlander, Mike Trout or Buster Posey, you must ask yourself: Would you rather see the U.S. win the WBC or see your favorite team open the season with a healthy roster?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/","id":4499,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[4498,4497,4496],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host No. 2 UCLA After Delay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8161.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8161.jpg?resize=300%2C520&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team will host No. 2 UCLA today at Cesar Uyesaka Stadium.

The game had been previously scheduled for last Tuesday, but due to weather conditions was moved to today. The Gauchos are currently tied for fifth with a 4-3 record in the Big West after two weeks of play. The Bruins come to town with a 4-2 record after taking two out of a three against Baylor on the road.</p>\n<p>“We hope that the schedule can work in our favor with jet lag and the whole deal,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “It will be fun for our guys. They didn’t come here just to play baseball, they came to play good baseball teams and that’s how you prepare for the postseason. It will be a good experience for our guys.”</p>\n<p>The Bruins return home from Texas after taking games one and three from Baylor with a couple of one-run victories, sandwiching a 5-0 loss on the second game. Junior center fielder Brian Carroll went 6-12 on the weekend with three stolen bases, two runs scored and a RBI. The big weekend gives Carroll a .478 average so far on the young season, tops for the Bruins. As a team, UCLA is hitting .284 and slugging .351.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Bruins’ pitching staff has been stellar so far this year. Each of the three starting pitchers holds a sub-2.20 ERA. Junior starting pitcher Adam Plutko was named as a preseason All-American and holds a 2.13 ERA and eight strikeouts in 12-and-two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos come into the matchup splitting a four-game series with San Francisco. Over the weekend, sophomore utility man Joe “Woody” Woodward went 6-11, which gave him a team-high .529 batting average. Woodward has done well with the playing time he has been given and has climbed to the top of the lineup. He leads the team with three stolen bases and a .600 on-base percentage over his 17 at bats.</p>\n<p>“He just keeps doing it and doing it. He sure likes to play and he is really playing well and doing a lot of different stuff for us right now so he is really doing a good job,” Checketts said. “We moved him up in the order [Sunday] and he has just shown a lot of perseverance. He is really contributing for us.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa has also been an offensive force in the middle of the lineup so far. Kuresa enters today’s game having collected a base hit in each of the first seven games and leads the Gauchos with 11 hits, five extra base hits, six runs scored and is tied with six RBI.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s starting pitcher for the Gauchos is yet to be determined as many pitchers were used over the four-game weekend series. Saturday’s game two starting pitcher, freshman Kenny Chapman, pitched just two innings and threw 60 pitches leaving him potentially available.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure who we will go with, I need to see how the arms bounce back,” Checketts said. “We used everybody. We will see where we go. Maybe Kenny Chapman and maybe Domenic Mazza and see if Domenic can go out and be himself.”</p>\n<p>First pitch for the one-game matchup against UCLA will take place at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium today.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Photo By MARK BROCHER / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/","id":4498,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4497,4496,4495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Series Against San Francisco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8305.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8305.jpg?resize=400%2C267&ssl=1","description":"In its first home series of the year, the UCSB baseball team split its four games against San Francisco.

After a double and a walk, Maffei hit a three-run homer to put USF up 4-1.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s second game, the Gauchos were blown out on their home turf 11-5. San Francisco scored at least one run in each of the first six innings.</p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon, the Gauchos defeated the Dons 6-1 to bring their winning streak to three games. Sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone twirled another gem, throwing seven and one-third innings and allowing only five hits while striking out three. Scoring began in the bottom of the first when Newell opened the inning with a walk. Back-to-back triples by Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa led to a three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos will be a visit from UCLA on Tuesday Feb. 26 in a rescheduled game from last Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared on page 5 of February 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50320\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/ucsb-splits-series-against-san-francisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50320\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/ucsb-splits-series-against-san-francisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/ucsb-splits-series-against-san-francisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/ucsb-splits-series-against-san-francisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/ucsb-splits-series-against-san-francisco/","id":4497,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4496,4495,4494],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Break Even Against Fierce Competition at Mary Nutter Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team had a disappointing weekend in the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic, losing three out of their four games and dropping to 9-5 on the season.

Right from the first inning, Renfroe lived up to the billing, retiring the first nine batters she faced and giving up only two runs in seven innings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB fell behind early after a two-run single by Madison Shipman in the first inning, and the Vols never looked back on their way to a 5-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s early game against BYU was perhaps the most exciting game of the season for both teams, as it was the Gauchos’ second extra inning game this year. Heading into the fifth inning with a 3-0 lead, the Gauchos pulled away with four more runs. The drama began in the bottom of the seventh, as BYU, trailing 10-3, began to rack up the hits. After the Cougars narrowed the gap to 10-6 and with the bases loaded, junior Katie Manuma stepped up to the plate and tied the game with a perfectly timed grand slam.</p>\n<p>UCSB would keep their composure in the eighth inning, as junior infielder Jessica Reichner put the Gauchos ahead with a one-run triple. Senior outfielder Jessica Soria followed up by bringing Reichner in with a single to make it 12-10. Sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom put away three straight batters in the bottom of the eighth to clinch the Gauchos’ only win of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Wisdom had a team-high three runs while freshman outfielder Jessica Tetzlaff led the team with three RBI on 3-5 batting, her biggest contribution to the team thus far.</p>\n<p>Playing as huge underdogs in the tournament opener against No. 1 Oklahoma Friday, the Gauchos quickly found themselves with a mountain to climb, facing an early 4-0 deficit and last week’s Big 12 Pitcher of the Week Michelle Gascoigne. UCSB fought back, lowering the deficit to 5-2 on a two-run double by Wisdom in the bottom of the third, but neither team would score another run as Oklahoma improved to 15-0 on the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos come back home for the Gaucho Classic II next weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared on page 6 of February 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/50314/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/50314/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/50314/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/50314/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/50314/","id":984,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[983,982,981],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Underwood Carries Gauchos to Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Basketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0324.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Basketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0324.jpg?resize=400%2C267&ssl=1","description":"Behind a career night from senior forward Sweets Underwood, the UCSB women’s basketball team handily defeated Cal State Northridge 66-55 at home.

[As for rebounding], that’s just my focus every game is to really crash the boards and rebound.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed why they are the best defensive team in the Big West in the first half, holding the Matadors to just 14 points. Santa Barbara forced 14 turnovers and held a 14-0 points off turnovers advantage while holding Northridge to 23.1 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“Their guards want to dribble penetrate and get to the paint and either get to the free throw line or kick for threes,” Mitchell said. We’re pretty disciplined most of the time when guarding that style of play.”</p>\n<p>After two disappointing losses to Cal Poly and Hawaii in its last two games, UCSB came out hot, jumping out to a quick 8-0 advantage. The Gauchos continued to extend their lead, taking a dominant 34-14 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>However, to open the second half, the tables turned and it was CSUN that came out on the attack, going on an 8-0 run. Using its press and picking up the defensive intensity, the Matadors forced nine UCSB turnovers in the first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>“When you’re up, and you start playing not to lose or not to turn the ball over or not understanding when to attack sometimes that messes with your mind a bit, and that did with our guards for a short spell there,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Even with a momentum switch, the game was still in the Gauchos’ control as the lead remained in double digits. Northridge continued knock on the door though, knocking down three consecutive treys with 2:28 remaining to close the gap to 10. In the second half, Northridge was 7-15 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Santa Barbara hit eight of its 10 free throws down the stretch to clinch the 66-55 victory.</p>\n<p>“Probably the only negative for me (today) was the last five minutes, giving up so many threes,” Mitchell said. “We have to find a way to put teams away and let the scoreboard really show how we controlled the game form the tip to the final buzzer.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos shot 43.4 percent from the field. Recording 18 assists on its 23 field goals, the 66 points were UCSB’s second-highest point total of the season.</p>\n<p>Along with Underwood’s standout performance, junior guard Nicole Nesbit contributed 11 points and a team-high five assists. The bench was also key for UCSB, tallying 21 points.

Taylor knocked down a three to spark a 10-2 run for the Gauchos. By halftime, Santa Barbara had maintained the lead, taking a 29-21 advantage. In the first half, the Gauchos outshot the Hornets 38.5 to 20.0 percent.</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story as UCSB was outshot 45.8 percent to 28 percent. The Hornets also shot 40 percent from downtown.</p>\n<p>Despite opening the second half with the same fire they came out with in the first and taking its largest lead of the game at 12 points with 15:18 to go, sophomore guard Mikh McKinney knocked down a jumper that sparked a 14-3 run by the Hornets. The Gauchos’ 12-point lead quickly became just one with 5:44 to go.</p>\n<p>“We took really poor care of the basketball when we were up. We took casual shots, quick threes and we had turnovers that led them right back into the game,” Coach Williams said. “They fought and scrapped. We were outcoached, we were outplayed and we were outhustled.”</p>\n<p>With the gap still just one point with three minutes left, Sacramento’s leading scorer, senior forward John Dickson, drained a three with just over a minute and a half to go to give the Hornets their first lead of the game at 45-47.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB fed sophomore center Alan Williams in the post, who converted a hook shot on the right block to tie the game at 47 all. Dickson countered for the Hornets with a reverse layup, but with 17 seconds remaining, freshman forward Taran Brown hit a clutch three from deep on the left wing to take a 50-49 lead.</p>\n<p>“We just ran a play called money, which gets us a lot of open threes in the corner,” Brown said. “My guy didn’t end up coming with me on that screen on the bottom block and I was able to get the open shot.”</p>\n<p>With the final possession, senior center Konnor Veteto came out to set a screen for sophomore guard Dylan Garrity for Sacramento. Big Al helped hedge, trying to trap Garrity, but Garrity got around the two Gaucho defenders to find Veteto wide open for a layup on the right block.</p>\n<p>“Al trapped, per design on the on ball screen and our wings stood and watched,” Coach Williams said. “Nobody rotated, so it’s a pretty big breakdown.”</p>\n<p>While the Hornets had four players in double figures, Brown was the only player to do so for UCSB, tallying a game-high 18 points. Taylor finished with nine points as well as six assists. Big Al really struggled for UCSB. Although he recorded 11 rebounds and five blocks, he finished with just eight points on 3-14 shooting.</p>\n<p>UCSB resumes league play next week when the team travels to Hawaii and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared on page 6 of February 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/gauchos-blow-lead-drop-third-straight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/gauchos-blow-lead-drop-third-straight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/gauchos-blow-lead-drop-third-straight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/gauchos-blow-lead-drop-third-straight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/gauchos-blow-lead-drop-third-straight/","id":645,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[644,643,642],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lucky Number 13","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Womens-Basketball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Womens-Basketball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The last time the UCSB and Hawaii women’s basketball teams played in Hawaii, the game went down to the final buzzer.

I always expect to win. It was a game we could’ve won.”</p>\n<p>After holding Hawaii’s star, junior forward Kamilah Martin, to two points and four rebounds in the first half, Martin took control of the game in the second half. With approximately 16 minutes remaining, Martin went on a 6-0 run.</p>\n<p>“[Martin’s] a great player,” Mitchell said. “Six of her 14 points came from the free throw line, so we’ll have to do a better job on getting onto her pivot foot and not bailing her out with a foul as the shot clock’s running down.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii fed off of Martin’s energy, seizing the momentum and expanding the lead to seven on a 12-2 run.</p>\n<p>“I think it had a lot to do with those first four minutes of the second half,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We were extremely flat and I think that’s when you saw a momentum change. I think that we let them get physical with us and it took a while for us to fight back.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB responded with a 9-2 run to tie the game at 45 all.</p>\n<p>“We just started attacking them,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We just have to learn to go at them and start from the beginning.”</p>\n<p>With 54 seconds to go, Underwood converted a layup to bring the score to 53-51. The next trip up the court, senior center Kirsten Tilleman forced Martin to turn the ball over and senior guard Destini Mason picked up the steal, giving UCSB possession of the ball with 27 seconds left.</p>\n<p>Similar to the play in Hawaii that won the game for the Gauchos, Nesbit dribbled down the right side of the court. As she drove into the key though, she was tied up and the possession arrow gave the ball back to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I was just attacking,” Nesbit said. “Our mentality was to get to the basket and get fouled. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the foul and they got the possession.”</p>\n<p>On the inbounds, UCSB was forced to foul and freshman guard Destiny King headed to the free throw line with a chance to finish the game. However, she only made one of her two free throws, giving UCSB hope and the ball at just a one-possession game.</p>\n<p>UCSB called a timeout, the score 54-51 with 4.6 seconds remaining in the game. On the inbounds play, Santa Barbara’s best three-point shooter, junior guard Melissa Zornig, came off a screen and received the ball at the top of the key. Driving to her left, she fired up a three point shot, but unfortunately for the Gauchos, the shot missed off the side of the rim.</p>\n<p>“It was the play we wanted; it wasn’t the shot we necessarily wanted because otherwise it would’ve gone in,” Mitchell said. “At the end of day, it shouldn’t have come down to that.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB outshot Hawaii 47.2 percent to 41.9 percent, but the Rainbow Wahine held the rebounding advantage at 27-23. The Gauchos gave up nine offensive boards, including several down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“The ultimate difference was I think the offensive rebounds in critical times when the shot clock was going down,” Mitchell said. “When [you] play hard for 28 seconds, give up the offensive board and you send them to the free throw line, I think that probably deflates you as a player at times.”</p>\n<p>Underwood led the charge offensively with 16 points while Nesbit chipped in 15. For Hawaii, Martin finished the game with 14 points and eight rebounds, but it was the bench that made the ultimate difference for Hawaii. 26 of the Rainbow Wahine’s 54 points came from the bench as junior guard Shawna-Lei Kuehu and King combined for 23 points.</p>\n<p>“We know they have strong, physical guards,” Mitchell said. “Kuehu and King are both wide bodies. [Hawaii] posted [their] guards and unfortunately, you can’t double when you have guards that are going to knock it down.”</p>\n<p>Despite a tough loss, UCSB will need to regroup quickly as the team hosts Cal State Northridge Saturday. The Gauchos have won the last 12 matchups against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>At 13-13 overall and 7-7 in the Big West, Northridge, like Santa Barbara, is a great defensive team, ranking second in scoring defense at 59.8 points per game and first in steals at 11.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“Losing can drive you out of your mind, but last time I checked, we have five more games left and we can control our own destiny,” Mitchell said. “There’s still a lot of season left to be played and the season’s not over with a loss here tonight.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met up in Northridge, UCSB defeated the Matadors handily 56-37. The Gauchos shot 46.8 percent from the field, including 57.7 percent in the second half. Then, they held the Matadors defensively to just 24.5 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>“They’re an extremely athletic team,” Mitchell said. “They’ll have their best game after we handled them well at their place.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Mark Brocher/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50297\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50297\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/","id":636,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[635,634,633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prep to Face Top Competition in Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Softball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Softball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team is off to a great start this season at 8-2, and will be looking to continue its early success this weekend in the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic.

It will need to do so in upset fashion, however, as two of the four games the Gauchos play this weekend are against undefeated top five teams in No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 4 Tennessee.</p>\n<p>UCSB opens up its weekend on Friday against Oklahoma (10-0), and although the Gauchos have started off the season solid offensively, they have not seen a pitching lineup anywhere near the talent level of the Sooners’. Boasting the arms of the last two Big 12 Pitcher of the Week winners in Keilani Ricketts and , Oklahoma is a nightmare opponent for any team it faces.</p>\n<p>Last week against No. 8 Missouri, the only ranked team UCSB has faced this season, the Gauchos were handed their only two losses of the season in blowout fashion. Despite the poor performances, the team has used last weekend as a positive learning experience.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“When we play [ranked teams], we just need to make sure we don’t give up any extra bases,” Head Coach Brie Galiciano said. “We play those caliber teams [this] weekend and just by playing them [last] weekend we know what things we have to work on going into the [Mary Nutter Collegiate] Classic.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB will play against BYU (4-6), but the majority of their preparation on that day will be for its night game against Tennessee (10-0). Another top team with strong pitching, led by Ellen Renfroe, the Volunteers will be another severe challenge for the young Gauchos’ squad. Renfroe has allowed only 13 runs in 10 starts, and Cheyenne Tarango leads the offense with 14 RBI on 13 hits this season along with a .500 batting average.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will close their weekend out against Nevada (5-5), a team off to a hot start to the season offensively and coming off a big win against No. 20 Hawaii last weekend.</p>\n<p>Tough opponents this weekend aside, the Gauchos still know that they stand atop the Big West with the best overall record, and they like the solid team performances thus far in the season.</p>\n<p>“We feel great about where we are,” freshman catcher Sami Stark said. “I feel like we’re a really cohesive team, especially with all the new people coming in, the older girls and all the returners did a really good job of welcoming us in and we really work well as a group.”</p>\n<p>Of the relatively small number of “older girls” that returned to the team this year, senior shortstop Keilani Jennings is leading the way offensively for the Gauchos. She leads the team with 14 RBI and four home runs, while hitting with a team high .438 batting average.</p>\n<p>Outfielder Jessica Soria, the only other senior on the team, leads UCSB with nine runs this season. With the veterans leading the way, it isn’t hard to see why the team has come together so easily despite its numerous younger players.</p>\n<p>“They’re doing a great job. They’re gelling together well, they’re rolling with the punches,” Galiciano said. “It’s just when things aren’t necessarily going their way they find a way to pull together, and like in [last weekend’s games], pull together and find a way to pull out the ‘W.’”</p>\n<p>When asked what the Gauchos had to do to possibly beat the kind of high-caliber teams that dominated them last week, Stark said, “Just play big. Just play like we can. Just hit the ball hard, and play big on defense.”</p>\n<p>UCSB plays Oklahoma at 3:30 p.m. on Friday, BYU at 2:30 p.m., Tennessee at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday and Nevada at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Mark Brocher/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50289\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/gauchos-prep-to-face-top-competition-in-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50289\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/gauchos-prep-to-face-top-competition-in-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/gauchos-prep-to-face-top-competition-in-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/gauchos-prep-to-face-top-competition-in-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/gauchos-prep-to-face-top-competition-in-classic/","id":985,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[984,983,982],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":157,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
