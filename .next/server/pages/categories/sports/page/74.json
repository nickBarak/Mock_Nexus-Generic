I’ve seen all these girls [in the field] before and hopefully I can put up a big score and get on the podium.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be one of two Gauchos competing in the Summer Games, along with UCSB alumna and kayaker <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-swim-captain-makes-olympic-debut-as-kayaker/\">Maggie Hogan</a>. Also traveling with Nwaba will be another familiar face to Gaucho athletics, Josh Priester.</p>\n<p>“I came into college as a hurdler and high jumper, and then Josh Priester, who’s still my coach now,” Nwaba said.  “I came in my sophomore year and he introduced me to the heptathlon, and that’s really what opened up the possibility of competing at the Trials and now the Olympics.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after her graduation, she joined the Santa Barbara Track Club, which was founded by Priester, a former assistant coach for Gaucho track and field. Priester, who specializes in coaching the multi-events (heptathlon and decathlon), now runs one of the premier running clubs in the country, training just down the coast at the Westmont College track.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I’m] proud to be on this team knowing I made it after trying so hard for four years. I’ve seen all these girls [in the field] before and hopefully I can put up a big score and get on the podium. – Barbara Nwaba</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Westmont opened their doors to us, and since it’s NAIA [National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics], the rules aren’t as strict as NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association]. Being in Santa Barbara is like paradise, like, why would I ever want to leave?” Nwaba joked after finishing the last event of the heptathlon in the customary Oregon rain.</p>\n<p>Nwaba has trained with Priester since her time at UCSB, and her growth has been massive. She has improved her personal record by over 500 points since setting the school record in the heptathlon with a score of 5989, remarkable for someone who became a multi-athlete just two years prior.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles native also holds the UCSB record in the 100m hurdles at 13.59, and is among the top 10 Gauchos in virtually every heptathlon event. Her crowning achievement in college, however, was winning the Big West Championship her senior year, a feat that earned her the title of All-American in her final season in blue and gold.</p>\n<p>When asked which win felt better, the Big West Championship or the Olympic Trials, Nwaba laughed.</p>\n<p>“Probably the Olympic Trials, although the Big West title was really exciting at the time,” she said with her ear-to-ear smile, which seemed to be glued to her face from the time she finished the 800m through the medal ceremony, media zone, and press conference, making no effort to hide her elation with the chance to compete at her debut Olympic Games.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72047\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72047\" data-attachment-id=\"72047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=1272%2C848&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1272,848\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72047 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Courtesy of ucsbgauchos.com\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?w=1272&amp;ssl=1 1272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of ucsbgauchos.com</p></div>\n<p>After winning the heptathlon and securing her ticket to Rio, though, Nwaba insists she didn’t know how to react to her triumph until she spotted a familiar face in the stands waiting for her. Her mother, Blessing, traveled from Los Angeles to the Trials without telling her daughter in order to prevent any distractions during the most important meet of Barbara’s life.</p>\n<p>“The happiness kicked in when I took my victory lap and saw my mom in the stands, who I didn’t know was there, and that’s when the waterworks came down. Everyone came up from L.A., my friends, coaches, family,” Nwaba said before pausing for a sigh of relief, joy and anything else she may have been feeling in her victorious moment.“It’s such a blessing.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba will compete in four events Friday, August 12 and the other three the next day, August 13, with her eyes on the podium in Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, over 6000 miles away from the UCSB track, where her heptathlon journey began.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

seen very often in sports. You have your occasional Bo Jackson’s that can dominate two sports but most of the time it’s hard enough just to dominate in one, something Gaucho alumna Maggie Hogan can attest to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her career at UCSB, Hogan was primarily known as a swimmer, and a good one at that. Even though she joined the team as a walk-on, Hogan worked hard and became co-captain of the 2001 swim team that ultimately won a Big West Championship, its first title since 1995 at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since graduating from UCSB, Hogan, now 37 years old, has continued competing as an athlete with her biggest achievement coming earlier this year when she qualified to represent the United States in the 2016 Rio Olympics. However, Hogan is not representing the United States women’s swim team, instead, she is representing a sport that is not talked about much and does not even exist in NCAA athletics: the canoe/kayaking team.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

However, Hogan was not even introduced to the sport until 2004 when she was in San Diego to try to make a spot on the U.S.’ surf skiing team for the upcoming Goodwill Games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not being used to this sport and facing tremendous competition, Hogan picked up the sport a lot quicker than anyone could’ve expected and earned a spot on the U.S. national team in 2005. From then on she has been training hard, waiting for her chance to one day represent the U.S. in the Olympic games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a nine-year career and not making the cut in 2008 and 2012, Hogan considered retirement. Instead, she decided to switch coaches and chose Michele Eray, a 2008 Olympian for South Africa. From then on, Hogan continued to work toward her dream, and her hard work paid off as in the 2015 Canoe Sprint World Championships she placed bronze in the K1 1000m, the first medal by a U.S. citizen in the World Championships in 20 years. Not only that, but she was the first American woman ever to receive a medal at said championships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, her work was not done there. In order to qualify as a K1 ( the individual event in Kayaking) athlete, the Philadelphia native would need to be the best not only of the U.S. competitors but the entire Pan American region as well. After winning the National Team Trials 500m, Hogan’s focus shifted to the Pan Am championships where placing first would guarantee her a spot in the Rio Olympics.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72053\" style=\"width: 340px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72053\" data-attachment-id=\"72053\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-swim-captain-makes-olympic-debut-as-kayaker/0430trials9_featured/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=640%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,424\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Maggie Hogan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=640%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72053\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?resize=330%2C219\" alt=\"Courtesy of Maggie Hogan\" width=\"330\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72053\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Maggie Hogan</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she was unable to take first, which went to Canada’s Lisa Bissonnette who edged out a win by .47, Hogan’s second place finish still qualified for the Rio Olympics because Canada had already earned a spot in Rio at the World Championships.</span></p>\n<p>And with that a 12-year journey came to fruition and dreams had finally come true for one Maggie Hogan. At age 37, it’s a safe bet that this will be Hogan’s first and only Olympics but that won’t make this moment any less special for her.

Known for his coaching legacy of 11 championships with the help of NBA greats such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, Jackson is hoping to return a sense of hope to the New York basketball scene at Madison Square Garden.</p>\n<p>Although the suggestion of New York being a “superteam” after its offseason additions by newly acquired former MVP Derrick Rose is far-fetched, the Knicks seem prone to make a postseason return with its roster improvements.</p>\n<p>In addition to receiving Rose, Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick in a trade with the Chicago Bulls for Robin Lopez, Jerian Grant and Jose Calderon, the Knicks most notable additions included Joakim Noah, Courtney Lee and Brandon Jennings within their total of seven signees along with two re-signees.</p>\n<p>While New York has revamped its starting lineup and added a little depth to its bench, its most important move was hiring new Head Coach Jeff Hornacek.</p>\n<p>Possessing a 101-112 overall coaching record after three seasons with the Phoenix Suns, Hornacek presents a refreshing change to the “in-house” approach Jackson has pursued in New York with ties to time spent with the Los Angeles Lakers in the hire of Derrick Fisher and the promotion of interim replacement Kurt Rambis.</p>\n<p>Certainly it will take time for the Knicks’ new talent to mesh together, but it’s the players’ potential to thrive in a system other than the “triangle offense” that Jackson has forced coaches to implement since his arrival.</p>\n<p>Able to return from a knee injury last season, Carmelo Anthony is preparing to enter his 14th NBA season in hopes of making a final push for a championship ring in the tail end of his career.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72012\" style=\"width: 218px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72012\" data-attachment-id=\"72012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/new-york-knicks-vs-portland-trailblazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=1808%2C1205&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,1205\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New York Knicks vs Portland Trailblazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72012\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=208%2C138\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of slamonline.com\" width=\"208\" height=\"138\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of slamonline.com</p></div>\n<p>Just once in Anthony’s career has he advanced further than the first round of the NBA Playoffs, enduring a 4-2 series loss in the 2009 Western Conference Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers while with the Denver Nuggets.</p>\n<p>A ball-dominant volume shooter, it is no question that Anthony will remain the team’s primary offensive scorer. Yet his role will have to adjust a bit as he prepares to play with players such as Rose, a slashing and driving point guard, along with accommodating the growth of Porzingis in his second year.</p>\n<p>With a renovated starting lineup intact, concerns still remain toward New York’s reserves on the bench. Jennings and Lee should be expected to carry the load as Jennings possesses an unpredictable scoring edge and Lee is a decent two-way player.</p>\n<p>With few impactful options available to come off the bench, the Knicks remaining alternatives can be considered a work in progress with players such as Mindaugas Kuzminskas, Maurice Ndour, Marshall Plumlee and Guillermo Hernangomez.</p>\n<p>With no draft pick in this year’s NBA Draft after including its 2016 first-round pick in its trade with the Toronto Raptors for Andrea Bargnani back in 2013, the questionability of New York’s bench only increases as it gets no return after trading away last year’s first-round pick in Grant.</p>\n<p>No, the Knicks aren’t sudden title contenders. Inevitably, the Knicks decline in the past three seasons has resulted in their inability to persuade a superstar free agent to join their team and make them a top contender.</p>\n<p>But this offseason was the most productive pursuit of uplifting the lifeless franchise since the acquisition of Anthony in 2010. Nonetheless, it has become possible again for the Knicks to land in the middle of the pack of the Eastern Conference standings in hopes of bringing back the New York allure that has been absent in most recent years.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With Hill and Exum receiving most of the playing time at the point, the Jazz will now offer 48 minutes of impactful defense at the spot where they started Raul Neto and Shelvin Mack, mixed with a heavy dosage of Trey Burke, in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>Though Neto and Mack weren’t awful on that end, there’s no doubt that Hill and Exum will be a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Signing Joe Johnson for two years and $22 million is perfect for a young team in need of veteran leadership and shooting, both of which Johnson offers in spades. Some secondary and tertiary play initiation will be helpful for bench-heavy units, and Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors will easily mask his defensive deficiencies at the rim.</p>\n<p>Pair him with Boris Diaw (acquired from the Spurs in a move to clear space), familiar with Gobert from their time on the French national team, and the youthful team has two old heads to navigate the Jazz to a playoff return at relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>The Jazz will struggle to keep up with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the perimeter, there’s no doubt, but dominating the Warriors on the boards and scaring them away from the rim has proved a decent tactic in the past.</p>\n<p>The Warriors kryptonite might be a more switch everything approach, with big guards capable of hounding Durant or Draymond Green in short stretches, or it might not exist at all, but the Jazz have added steady contributors to a roster already fairly well-suited to establish itself among the Western Conference elites, and as the Warriors’ toughest competition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>7 Seconds or Less Comes to Houston</em></strong><em> </em></p>\n<p>The Rockets were a massive disappointment last season after many picked them as the second or third best team in the Western Conference.

Gordon will presumably come off the bench, though it wouldn’t be shocking to see D’Antoni start James Harden as his point guard next season. He’s a better offensive player than Beverley, more versatile and a better shooter, and D’Antoni has proven a strong defensive unit is not his priority.</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has the shooting that both Morey and D’Antoni crave at the power forward position, but back injuries have left his future in question. Anderson earning $21 million in his age 28 season is concerning, as the success of the contract will be totally reliant on his ability to stay healthy. He will open the paint for the Harden, Clint Capela pick-and-roll, a play with deadly potential on a spaced floor.</p>\n<p>The question for both Anderson and Gordon, teammates for the past few seasons in New Orleans, is whether or not they can contribute to a competent defense. The Rockets’ offense should be a joy to watch, but it’s not assured that Houston, juiced up on D’Antoni, will have a defense strong enough to stay much above 500. Harden should lead the team back to the playoffs, but a top-five seed seems like a stretch.</p>\n<p>Capela should be in store for a dominant breakout season; a talented rim runner, he has the perfect skill set to run the type of offense Dwight Howard stalled in his time as a Rocket.

Marks added a lottery ticket at the shooting guard position in Caris LeVert, who showed the ability to score in bunches in his four years at Michigan.</p>\n<p>Though the lower body injuries that cut short his final two seasons are a concern, LeVert shot over 40 percent from three on over four attempts per game from his sophomore season onward.</p>\n<p>That shooting ability was paralleled by improvements in each of his four years in assists per game and assist percentage (an estimate of the number of teammate field goals assisted by a player while on the floor), the latter reaching 33 percent in his final season.</p>\n<p>With Rondae Hollis-Jefferson establishing himself as a defensive menace and an athletic marvel in his rookie campaign, the Nets are in need of someone at either the shooting guard or small forward to make up for his poor offensive game outside the paint.</p>\n<p>Enter LeVert, who should be able to grow with Hollis-Jefferson, cover up his shooting woes and allow the Arizona product to work off-ball cuts to his preferred areas more often as a result of potentially advanced playmaking at both guard positions.</p>\n<p>With the Boston Celtics receiving their first round pick in each of the next two seasons, adding LeVert gave the team another possible young building block.</p>\n<p>Speaking of guards, Sean Marks was able to acquire Jeremy Lin on a steal of a contract at three years, $36 million.</p>\n<p>Possibly eager to reunite with new the Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, a developmental wizard who was an assistant with the Knicks during Lin’s initial breakout, Lin took what seemed below his market value at an average of $12 million per season. Maybe the Nets were the only ones offering a starting job, but getting Lin for the next three years will give the Nets a competent starting point guard who could easily shift to a backup role if need be.</p>\n<p>Lin has shown the ability, both in Los Angeles and in Charlotte last year, to run an excellent pick-and-roll, with the speed to get downhill into the paint quickly and a strong shooting stroke both off the dribble and catch. He isn’t starting for a championship contender, but he fills the biggest hole on the Nets’ roster and gives them a reliable go-to play with a Brook-Lin pick-and-roll that will be difficult to stop in the regular season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71975\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71975\" data-attachment-id=\"71975\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/img25367215/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img25367215\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71975\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?resize=311%2C194\" alt=\"Jeremy Lin averaged 11.7 ppg coming off the bench in Charlotte last season.

Tyler Johnson and Allen Crabbe both received huge paydays with four-year contracts for $50 and $75 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Though both offers were matched by Miami and Portland respectively, the two bloated contracts will limit the future possibilities for both franchises. In Miami, Johnson’s contract will count for just under $6 million against the cap during his first two seasons, before tripling in cost for the final two.</p>\n<p>Though Miami hopes it can hit big on free agency during those first two years, paying Johnson, Whiteside and Goran Dragic close to $70 million in 2019-20 will constrict those desires.</p>\n<p>Crabbe will earn around $18 million per season, slightly more than the recently signed Evan Turner. Crabb is probably best served as a backup shooting guard, playing alongside either Lillard or McCollum while the other rests, though this is a ton of money for that service.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the Blazers have over $45 million invested in two players who harbor sufficient liabilities (defense for Crabbe, lack of outside shooting for Turner) to make both best suited for reserve roles.</p>\n<p>The Blazers hold few options moving forward, and with an extension for CJ McCollum uprising, they will likely be stuck with some iteration of this roster for the foreseeable future. Thanks to Marks’ aggressive moves, the Nets hamstrung two of the more dangerous teams in the league; Portland fresh off an impressive showing against the Warriors, and the Heat who are always a threat for a league-altering splash.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>The Celtics Get Their Man</em></strong></p>\n<p>Boston was finally able to lure a free agent to what has been a malaise of mediocre young talent and promises of a not-so-distant contender. Constantly propped up by the coaching of Brad Stevens, this odd collection of players was able to cobble together 48 wins in 2015-16, but clearly needed more offensive firepower apart from Isaiah Thomas in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Al Horford should perfectly complement this team, and vice versa; Jae Crowder will be an upgrade defensively from anyone who played small forward recently for the Hawks, likewise for Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart as point-of-attack stoppers who far exceed Dennis Schröder and Jeff Teague in that capacity.’</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71976\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71976\" data-attachment-id=\"71976\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71976\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Al Horford started all 82 games last season for the Hawks averaging 15.2 points per game and 7.3 rebounds per game.

Kelly Olynyk and Jonas Jerebko are also far superior three-point shooters to Millsap, offering Horford more space to operate during their shared time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the draft, the team reached for Jaylen Brown, impressed with his athleticism, ability to drive to the rim and seemingly high character. Though Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn and even Jamal Murray offered a higher floor than Brown, who held some of the worst statistical translations for such a high pick in recent history (Kevin Pelton), none shared Brown’s hydra-like ceiling on the wing, able to tenaciously defend four positions and get to the rack at will.</p>\n<p>The Cal product certainly struggles to fulfill that potential, however, as defensively his body is far more NBA-ready than his mind, and on the offensive end, his impressive drives end with missed lay-ups more often than made ones, and his passing ability is inconsistent. The flashes of a great player are there, and the Celtics are certainly a team with the flexibility to bring him along slowly, but it’s not difficult to see his career being a substantial disappointment.</p>\n<p>Ainge spent his next-to-first rounders on Guerschon Yabusele, a 20-year-old power forward from France who looked like an absolute tank in summer league and may come over this season, and Ante Zizic, a 19-year-old Croation center with vociferous energy who will stay abroad for at least one more year. Yabusele offers physicality and playmaking in a 270-pound package, and though he’ll require a ton of coaching on defense, it’s easy to picture him making a contribution in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The young supporting cast is perfect for Horford, as his post-30 career will be aided by a roster that mostly shares a positive age curve. Boston is still in need of another star, and for either Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown or one of the other draftees to show some serious juice.</p>\n<p>In an offseason where Celtics established themselves in the wrung below the Cavaliers out East, however, the move is a welcomed development for a franchise that was treading water, and can now consider itself a conference finals contender.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71968\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71968\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/","id":3320,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3319,3318,3317],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Farewell to the Big Fundamental","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/duncan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/duncan.jpg?resize=920%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tim Duncan's decision to retire has the entire NBA world and assistant sports editor Jorge Mercado reminiscing over the great career of the big fundamental.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=606%2C126\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"606\" height=\"126\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most commonly used lines in sports, and in life, is that Father Time is undefeated.

We all know the greatness of Duncan. We know about the five rings, three Finals MVPs, 15 all-star appearances, two league MVP awards and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of such a decorated and honored career most people, including myself, can also come to the conclusion that Duncan is the greatest power forward to ever live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He was the star of a team that, for 19 years, displayed constant greatness year in and year out. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spurs never missed a playoff series during his 19-year career and have maintained a winning percentage never less than .610. Duncan is also only one of two players in NBA history to win an NBA title in three different decades (the ’90s, ’00s, ’10s).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Duncan a true superstar is the fact that he never acted like or was treated like one. He never caused controversy — except for when it came to his disdain over his favorite referee, Joey Crawford — and never wanted to be in the spotlight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duncan wasn’t “sexy” like these other superstars. I mean, seriously, what’s sexy about the nickname “The Big Fundamental.” It’s no “King James” and it certainly is no “Black Mamba,” but it’s representative of him, and that’s what makes it special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was only one thing he cared about: winning. And in this day and age in which loyalty has become overrated and players are constantly seeking a bigger market to expand their brand, it’s refreshing to know that there was a player who truly looked beyond superficiality and simply wanted to play the sport he loves with his beloved teammates, coaches, and city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Kobe Bryant had to make his exit from the NBA known to the world by jacking up 50 shots and scoring 60 points — that’s why we love you, Kobe — it was fitting that Duncan’s way of leaving was to make a quiet exit toward stage right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Clipper fan, I know Duncan will always have a special place in my heart, seeing as how he constantly used to rip it out in the pre-Chris Paul days. From 2003-2010, the Spurs and The Big Fundamental beat the Clippers in 26 of 27 match-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ups including an 18-game winning streak from 2006-2010.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard being a Clipper fan — trust me, I can attest — but it’s only made harder when there’s one team and one guy in particular who continually beat your team quite handily.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71892\" style=\"width: 287px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71892\" data-attachment-id=\"71892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-12/farewell-to-a-big-fundamental/29906170001_3624585928001_screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"539,374\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=277%2C192\" alt=\"Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of Associated Press\" width=\"277\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?w=539&amp;ssl=1 539w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of <em>Associated Press</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why when the Clippers beat the Spurs in that playoff series in 2015 and Chris Paul made that game-winning shot in game seven over Duncan, my life as an NBA fan was, in a way, complete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know it’s not the same as winning a championship — and believe me, the next round is still painful to talk about to this day — but finally seeing the team I love to get over the hump against the team I despised most was truly satisfying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My hate for Duncan was simply out of respect for the man and his craft. I hated that he wasn’t a Clipper, winning all those games and championships for us, but I loved the man he was on the court and respected the man off of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching Duncan lose that series against the Clippers was like seeing my favorite cartoon hero defeat his enemy for the first time. And yet, watching Duncan retire is like watching the final episode of that cartoon; it really feels like my childhood is over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess that’s why No. 21’s decision to retire really gets me at an emotional level. But as the other constantly heard cliché goes, all good things must come to an end. Just like every great player that has walked away from the game during my lifetime, I’ll get over it. But I’ll never forget the greatness that is known as Tim Duncan aka the Big Fundamental.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks for the memories, Tim, and I can’t wait to watch that Hall of Fame induction speech in 2021.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Really, I am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those people had to suffer through 52 years of brutal heartache and 147 seasons played in professional baseball, basketball, football and even hockey since winning their last title. Hell, the last time they won a trophy was when the Browns took the victory in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, two years before it became known as the Super Bowl. It was about time they have something to celebrate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And celebrate they have, after the Cavs, led by superstar LeBron James, won their first NBA title in NBA history. Riots in the streets; fights breaking out; people jumping up and down on cars, hanging on streetlights and lampposts, breaking bar windows, climbing responding fire engines and ambulances, stealing road signs and traffic cones, etc. etc. A lifetime of anguish for many Clevelanders was let loose in one night in a fit of terror on their own city. But, hey, they needed this.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a San Diego sports fan, I can relate.

Neither has won their current league’s title, with the Padres only appearing in the World Series twice, while the Chargers have appeared in only one Super Bowl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Padres made it to the World Series in 1984 and 1998 and got destroyed both times. In their first appearance against Detroit, the Padres stood no chance, losing the series 4-1. Their second time around they did even worse as they were swept by the Yankees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers one appearance in the Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger was an absolute blowout as Steve Young, who threw for 325 and a still-NFL-record six touchdown passes, and the 49ers cruised to an easy 49-26 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three of these championship appearances are from either before I was born or at least before I can remember. But the strongest memories I do have about the two teams I’ve loved my whole life involve similar heartache in which I witness them get close to a chance at a title and then watch that opportunity wash away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most striking and lasting impression I have of my Chargers is from the 2006 season, when the team finished with the best record in the NFL at 14-2. They were the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and primed for Super Bowl contention led by stars such as Philip Rivers and Ladainian Tomlinson and looks forward to home field advantage secured throughout the playoffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite all the hype and excitement, they then collapsed in their first game of the postseason. A startling 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots in which they committed four turnovers, three of which led to Patriots scoring drives. Despite outgaining their opponent in rushing yards and total yards as well as intercepting opposing quarterback Tom Brady three times, the Chargers’ season was cut short in catastrophic fashion.</span></p>\n<p>Not to be outdone by their football counterpart, the Padres had a heartbreaking season of their own in 2010, a year in which they were predicted to finish last in the NL West but shocked the sports world by holding strong atop the division for most of the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71846\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71846\" data-attachment-id=\"71846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/san-diego-padres-ballpark/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"645,340\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"san diego padres ballpark\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71846\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?resize=365%2C192\" alt=\"Petco Park, the home of the San Diego Padres who have two world series appearances, both losses, in team history.

It would take a monumental collapse for the Padres to blow a chance at the postseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And that is exactly what happened. The Padres proceeded to lose ten straight games into the month of September, a historic collapse that left them clinging to the top of the division by a thread.</p>\n<p>After leading the NL West for 148 days of the season, the Padres officially relinquished a playoff spot for good to the Giants with a loss on the very last day of the season. San Francisco went on to win the World Series while the Padres went home and haven’t had a winning season since.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these finishes left me reeling from a combination of grief and rage that lasted intensely for a minimum of weeks and then slowly worked into my overall emotional impression of San Diego pro sports. It’s memories like these that have left me cynical and demoralized regarding the topic, but not without hope.</span></p>\n<p>No, never without hope. The hope is what keeps me alive. Every new season without fail brings fresh dreams that maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that everything changes. Maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that America’s finest city captures its first-ever modern pro sports title.</p>\n<p>2016 probably isn’t that year. Seeing as the 2015-16 NFL season already concluded with the Chargers well out of playoff contention and the 2016 MLB season is about halfway done with the Padres mired in a sixth straight losing season, the title drought is almost assuredly extending to an extraordinary 54 years.=</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, hey, if Cleveland can finally get theirs, maybe our time is coming soon, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or maybe not.</span></p>\n<p>Just give me one before I die, San Diego.

O’Colly / Devin Wilber</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other notable players included redshirt sophomore second baseman JJ Muno who led the team in hits with 68 and batted a solid .294. Redshirt junior Andrew Calica also had a great final season at UCSB batting .252 from the plate, leading the team in OBP (.427) and finishing with the most hit by pitches in school history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomores pitcher Kyle Nelson and shortstop Clay Fisher, were invited to the Collegiate National Team Trials. Fisher is known as one of the best defensive shortstops in the country while Nelson is known as one of the best pitchers, registering seven wins and 10 saves on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the Gauchos have a bunch to look forward to. Most of their star field players will be returning for next season with the exception of Calica, who was picked by Cleveland in the 11th round. This was the second time the Indians selected him as, straight out of high school, Cleveland picked him in the 17th round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What UCSB will have to replace is pitching as, along with the loss of Bieber, redshirt junior right-handers James Carter and Trevor Bettancourt both left to the MLB and as did redshirt senior Justin Kelly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, with all that being said, the Gauchos still have a very bright future. Thanks to their strong staff and one of the best head coaches in the country in Checketts, UCSB has created a winning culture at Santa Barbara and one that many great athletes will want to come and thrive in.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

After his recent performance in the Copa América Final loss to Chile, he blamed himself for the team’s loss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many critics believe Messi is being too hard on himself by accepting full blame for his team’s loss.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the loss to Chile in 2016, Messi had already begun contemplating retirement from international soccer after so many futile efforts to win a championship for Argentina. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he missed that penalty kick last week in the Copa Finals, he knew then that the end of his soccer career had arrived, and the missed shot seemed to validate his decision to retire, not just for him, but for his team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Messi is living proof that even the best can make mistakes. Messi has certainly made mistakes before, yet this mistake leaves Messi reconsidering his entire future. Should this one mistake cause Messi to retire from his national team and international soccer?  He seems to think so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he will continue to play club soccer for Spanish champions FC Barcelona, he will be dearly missed on the global stage and Argentina national team, as he was an idol to many across the world.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years later, the United States remains somewhat of a laughing stock in the footballing world, struggling to impose their style of play on games against teams that are clearly superior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the national team’s most visible struggle under Klinsmann, and something that continued in its three losses to Colombia and Argentina in the Copa América.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After exiting the Copa at the semifinals in a pretty embarrassing display against Argentina — the U.S. didn’t even get off a shot in the match, resulting in a 4-0 loss — now is as good a time as any to reconsider the future of the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the weeks leading up to the tournament, the manager’s job was coming under question with the expectation that Klinsmann would likely be relieved of his duties should he prove unable to lead his players through a deep run at the cup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quite a bit of it is always results. We take time after every major competition to reflect on that competition and what led up to it. It’s not a single game, or a single result. It’s where the program is and how comfortable we feel in the direction that it’s going,” Gulati said to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ussoccer.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after hiring the German.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This pragmatic approach is a perfect system of reevaluation for the president of a national FA. If the head of U.S. soccer still holds these beliefs, then he needs to really contemplate whether or not Klinsmann is the man to truly evolve not only the on-field results of the national team, but the general view of the sport in a country that’s just now starting to latch onto the beautiful game as a national passion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klinsmann has surely brought more stability to the national team setup, consistently selecting the same core players since he took over as boss, including German-American recruits John Brooks, Jermaine Jones and Fabian Johnson, all players that have proven themselves as some of the most talented athletes to represent the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistency and stability over time, though, fade into redundancy, and Klinsmann has failed to improve results in his five-year tenure. If Gulati honestly surveys the competition at the U.S.’s last two major tournaments, a semifinal appearance in the Copa América is almost less impressive than advancing from the 2014 World Cup’s “group of death.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, in the two years between the tournaments, there has been little to no improvement in the team’s roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where is Julian Green, who in one of his only chances with the national team scored a brilliant volley on Belgium’s Thibaut Courtois? Where is Juan Agudelo, who, last year against Mexico showcased technical ability on a level that is nowhere to be found in Klinsmann’s current “preferred” side?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the biggest question of all: Where in the world was young starlet Christian Pulisic at the Copa América, who was given all but a half hour on the field throughout the entire tournament?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let it be known that zero other Americans have the quality to make the first team at Borrusia Dortmund, and Pulisic is much more than a part player in Thomas Tuchel’s squad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 17-year-old was eased into the team with substitute appearances in the Bundesliga, but over the course of the season, solidified his role as an impact sub coming in on the wing for the German league runners-up, even grabbing a couple goals in key matches during his team’s title race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The argument that Pulisic couldn’t fit into the starting lineup for the U.S. is absurd; when a player has the pace, ability to take on defenders and talent to pick out a pass in the attacking third for one of Europe’s finest clubs, he has the quality to start every game for the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s most shocking about how Klinsmann handled Pulisic’s first major exposure to the senior national team, though, is how he seemed to tiptoe around the subject in press conferences, as if he was afraid of Pulisic gaining too much fandom so early in his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America undoubtedly has struggled with overhyping under-talented players, namely Freddy Adu, but when a young man shows the promise of becoming a truly world-class footballer, playing time never hinders growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Klinsmann opted for more established players such as Gyasi Zardes, Michael Bradley and Kyle Beckerman against Argentina showed a lack of boldness when facing Messi and co. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting back and defending was never going to beat the top-ranked South American country, but still, Klinsmann was afraid of making a change that may yield criticism upon failure, almost like he was trying his best to save his job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he was hired as the new manager of a long-term project like the U.S. men’s team in 2011, he promised an injection of youth, but six of the starters versus Argentina were 30 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. soccer has stagnated, and Klinsmann is to blame as much as anyone. With the next World Cup in two years, now would be the perfect time for Gulati to cut his losses with the German and hire a new, more daring coach who offers a higher ceiling for the national team as it fights through qualifying for Russia.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/","id":1929,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1928,1927,1926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2016 NBA Mock Draft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nba-draft-16.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nba-draft-16.jpg?resize=980%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Prepared to tip-off this evening, the 2016 NBA Draft entail an abundance of talented prospects looking to excel at the next level.

The Los Angeles Lakers also kept their pick, avoiding the potential disaster of two teams jumping them in the lottery, a scenario with a probability just under 45 percent, in which case they would’ve had to sacrifice their No. 4 pick to Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>Despite the lack of excitement on lottery night, knowing the fixed order allows us to start putting together a more accurate mock draft. I’ll give a choice of 1A or 1B — a worst-case pick scenario and a possible trade for each team in the top three — along with a normal mock for the rest of the lottery.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1A: Ben Simmons</strong></p>\n<p>The Sixers have to be keyed in on Ben Simmons in the pre-draft process. While Ingram won’t be a disaster pick, Simmons is the exact type of player they’ve been looking for during this entire process. Whether or not he reaches his ceiling, that ceiling is a perennial all-star, and there’s no reason to pass that up because of a season with mixed results at LSU.</p>\n<p>The Simmons-Embiid pick and roll is the Sixers’ best shot at having a truly un-guardable play in their arsenal, and Jahlil Okafor and Dario Saric are not of the ilk to throw that away. Finding a team to take those two in return for established role players would be an easy feat, with the Celtics being a team that was already rumored to have interest in Okafor during the trade deadline.</p>\n<p>Simmons would force the Sixers to clear out an overcrowded front court, but Bryan Colangelo seems intent on roster change anyway, making Simmons an even clearer choice.</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Brandon Ingram</strong></p>\n<p>If they get cold feet, Ingram won’t be an atrocious pick, as he will allow the team to stay together. If Saric turns out to be an immediate threat on offense and he and Ingram rain threes around further-along-than-we-thought Embiid and Okafor post-ups all season, then this pick doesn’t look half bad.</p>\n<p>Ingram would most likely start at shooting guard alongside Embiid, Saric and Robert Covington in a lineup that has to look promising to Sixers fans with three potential Rookie of the Year candidates.</p>\n<p>Considering that Simmons may force his way to Los Angeles — an unlikely but imaginable scenario — Ingram is a decent plan B for the Sixers.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst Case: Kris Dunn</strong></p>\n<p>While Dunn is a solid player and point guard is a position of need for the Sixers, he is certainly not worth the top pick. They could trade back with a team like the Celtics, Suns or even the Timberwolves depending on what they were looking for in return, but with such a perceived gap between Simmons, Ingram and the rest of the draft, this seems unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential trades:</strong></p>\n<p>Separated into two groups: trading down in the draft and trading for a star.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading down</strong>: (<strong>Celtics</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 3, pick No. 16, pick No. 23, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and Celtics get pick No. 1; (<strong>Suns</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 4, pick No. 13, Devin Booker, PJ Tucker and Suns get pick No. 1; (<strong>Timberwolves</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 5, Ricky Rubio, Zach LaVine.</p>\n<p>Each of these trades gives the Sixers a credible way to build their backcourt while still maintaining a value based approach and getting a good deal of bang for their buck. My favorite deal would probably be some form of the one with the Suns, as Booker and Dunn could combine for a really skilled backcourt and Tucker would provide a veteran who could actually contribute to this Philadelphia team.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading for a star</strong>: Sixers get Paul George and Pacers get pick No. 1, Dario Saric and Nerlens Noel; Sixers get Jimmy Butler and Bulls get pick No. 1, Nerlens Noel and Jerami Grant.</p>\n<p>These are the two names (George and Butler) that have been thrown out a lot since the end of the season, and both fit huge holes in both the Sixers roster and [[the]] rebuilding project. If the Pacers or Bulls were to agree to a version of these offers, probably excluding only Joel Embiid, the Sixers should be quick to accept.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Los Angeles Lakers</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>1A: Ben Simmons</strong></p>\n<p>The Sixers taking Ingram is still the best case scenario for the Lakers, who desperately need another source of efficient offense to pair with D’Angelo Russell. Simmons would be a bit of an awkward fit while Russell has the ball in his hands, but two players with that kind of passing ability on the same team causes the heart to flutter.</p>\n<p>Luke Walton would have his centerpieces of the future, and though it might not be enough to save Jim Buss’ job, drafting Ben Simmons would bring stability back to “Lakernation.”</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Brandon Ingram</strong></p>\n<p>If the Sixers make the correct pick, the Lakers are left with another easy choice as they’ll snatch up Ingram and allow Randle to stay in the starting lineup. While Randle is certainly worthy of a bench role with Simmons on the team, him running pick and roll with Russell, surrounded by capable shooters in Ingram and Clarkson, is the beginning of a productive offense.</p>\n<p>Ingram may well be better than Simmons if he hits all his ceilings, and he is a year younger than the Australian native, but the likelihood that he reaches his peak seems less compared the young man who came close to averaging 20, 10 and five in his freshman season in college, albeit on a sorry LSU team.</p>\n<p>In the long term, an Ingram and Russell duo may even be able to play with one another in the backcourt in a super tall lineup that could baffle defenses with skill and size. Ingram’s ability to play three different positions will drastically help the Lakers embrace contemporary NBA basketball.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst Case: Buddy Hield</strong></p>\n<p>The Lakers maybe become enamored with the college stardom of Buddy Hield, either one of the obvious picks really disappoints pre-draft and the Lakers pass on a star to draft a guy who doesn’t fit with either Clarkson or Russell. However, this scenario is unlikely as scouts have had Ingram and Simmons pegged as the one and two picks for months.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential trades</strong>: D’Angelo Russell and pick No. 2 for either Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Demarcus Cousins or James Harden. While the Pacers, Bulls, Kings and Rockets will probably choose to keep their developed stars, if any team shows interest in a deal, the Lakers should jump at the opportunity and hope they can use it to entice Kevin Durant or another top-line free agent.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Boston Celtics</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>1A: Dragan Bender</strong></p>\n<p>Bender is a solid consolation prize for Boston, fitting the mold of a rangy, shot-blocking four who appears fully equipped to one day have a potent offensive game. While young and undeveloped, according to <em>RealGM</em>.<em>com,</em> Bender shot over 36 percent on 1.92 three pointers per game, solid numbers considering he played only 12 minutes per contest with Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 2015-16 season of international competition.</p>\n<p>His steal and block percentages sit at 2.17 and 6.17, respectively, for the same international competition this year via <em>RealGm.com</em>, numbers that would place him toward the top of the league for a big man in both categories according to <em>Basketballreference</em>.<em>com</em>. Bender is also a good athlete and should be able to play the three through five positions in time, which could be important to the mobile defense the Celtics are trying to construct.</p>\n<p>If Bender shows the ability to combine what could be an unsolvable offensive game with adaptable defense, his ceiling becomes much higher. Brad Stevens is the perfect coach to develop the seven-footer’s unique game, and Bender would finally give Boston a prospect with star-level ceiling.</p>\n<p>Assuming he’s there at three and there’s no trade offer from the teams mentioned in the Lakers section, Danny Ainge would be a fool to pass on such a perfect talent for the innovative team he’s creating.</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Marquese Chriss</strong></p>\n<p>The Celtics don’t have a great second option here, as guards are what this draft has to offer despite the fact that Boston has a roster full of them. Kris Dunn is probably the third or fourth best player in this draft, but Dunn’s talent isn’t daunting enough to blow up one of the cheapest and deepest backcourts in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Jamal Murray can shoot the heck out of the ball, but his other NBA level skills are lacking to say the least, making his ceiling far too low for the No. 3 pick. Though Buddy Hield showed a well-developed game in his senior year, his measurables weren’t impressive enough to allow him to play comfortably at the three in small ball lineups, something else that would clog up the C’s backcourt.</p>\n<p>Thus, if the Celtics are going to pass on Bender, they should do it for the player with nearly the most potential in this draft, Marquese Chriss. No player in this draft — not Ben Simmons, not Brandon Ingram, nobody — will blow your mind on certain plays like Marquese Chriss. His jumping ability, speed and nose for the ball give him the potential to be a real force in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Brad Stevens would be a great coach to bring Chriss along slowly, and his potential shot blocking and controlled aggression fits seamlessly with Smart, Bradley and Crowder in a swarming Boston defensive unit. The Celtics are in no need of quality role players; they have a team filled top to bottom with guys who could easily find a spot on every NBA rotation. The Celtics are in need of true transformational talents, making Chriss an easy pick over the likes of Murray and Hield.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst case: trading the pick for a non-star</strong></p>\n<p>The worst case for the Celtics is Ainge getting antsy and trading away the pick because he doesn’t want to develop a raw player like Bender or Chriss. While Celtics fans certainly want to be in contention soon, there are nearly zero options better than choosing either one of the young swings in Bender or Chriss.</p>\n<p>Jahlil Okafor’s name has been bandied about as a trade target with the No. 3 pick, and though his playmaking and ability to put the ball in the bucket would fit nicely with the Celtics, Bender and Chriss each offer a much more reliable path in the years to come. Stevens loves players who can toggle between the wing and big man positions, and at the three spot in the draft he should have his choice between two superior options.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade options</strong>: <strong>Gordon Hayward or Derrick Favors in a “who says no” offer</strong>.</p>\n<p>Bender and Chriss certainly hold the talent to be better than those two, but the uncertainty they get there is substantial. Hayward and Favors immediately make the Celtics more serious in the East and up Boston’s free-agent profile considerably.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Phoenix Suns: Marquese Chriss</strong></p>\n<p>They will be hoping Dragan Bender falls to them, and it wouldn’t be a surprising outcome to see the Suns attempt to trade up with the Celtics. There is a huge hole at the four and on the wing in Phoenix, making Jaylen Brown an option as a project pick and Chriss a sneaky candidate once again.</p>\n<p>Assuming Bender goes third, the Suns should go with Chriss, as he could potentially offer a more athletic option next to the plodding Alex Len in a future frontcourt. If Bledsoe is able to step up his defensive consistency and Len can develop better verticality at the rim, Chriss could be the defensive star that can mask Brandon Knight and Devin Booker on the wing.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Minnesota Timberwolves: Buddy Hield</strong></p>\n<p>Hield is the perfect fit for the Timberwolves, and it would be a dream for Minnesota fans if he were to fall to them at the No. 5 pick. With Rubio still the point guard of the future, accumulating shooting should be the priority for the Wolves around him and Karl-Anthony Towns.</p>\n<p>Hield and Murray are the two best shooters in the draft and will present Tom Thibodeau with a difficult decision as Murray could develop into a secondary ball handler, allowing the mercurial UCLA product Zach LeVine to stay at his natural two-guard position in the long term.</p>\n<p>Thibodeau will be interested in moving this developing team along, and Hield offers the best chance to solidify the shooting guard position for Minnesota, and, along with progress from Tyus Jones, the entire backcourt.</p>\n<p><strong>6) New Orleans Pelicans: Jamal Murray</strong></p>\n<p>An ideal course of events for the Pelicans, with Murray they grab their Eric Gordon replacement as well as an insurance plan for Jrue Holiday. The Pelicans are still in desperate need of bigs to play with Anthony Davis, but unless Bender or Chriss fall to them, there aren’t many viable options at six.</p>\n<p>Murray would provide a nice offensive option for Alvin Gentry, and his young age finally gives the Pelicans another lottery ticket after doing their best to rid themselves of all the ones they had at the start of the Anthony Davis era. Jaylen Brown could also be an interesting option for similar home-run potential reasons, though their need for shooting will outweigh the need for wing depth. Kris Dunn might be the best pick if Holiday is going to leave in a season, but the desire to win now will eschew the Pelicans from drafting the Providence star.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Denver Nuggets: Jaylen Brown</strong></p>\n<p>On a team filled with promising young players, Denver can afford to roll the dice on the raw Cal product Jaylen Brown to be its wing of the future. While his and Mudiay’s shooting might be untenable together on the court, the thought of those two cloaking the perimeter defensively has to strike fear into the minds of GMs around the league.</p>\n<p>Kris Dunn is still the best player on the board, but the Nuggets have Mudiay and creating a logjam at the point doesn’t seem to be in their best interest. Henry Ellenson could fit nicely next to Nikola Jokic and Jusef Nurkic, but more athleticism is probably warranted in an ideal four-five pairing.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Sacramento Kings: Kris Dunn</strong></p>\n<p>Another best-case scenario — this time for the Kings — Kris Dunn is an exquisite replacement for Rajon Rondo and would hopefully save Sacramento from doling out a big contract to the assist gorger. Dunn would finally give the Kings a young and talented option at point guard, and his consistent defense will be a welcomed addition for new coach Dave Joerger.</p>\n<p>Dunn has the ability to compete from day one and should pair perfectly with Cousins for a revamped Kings season in the new arena. Vlade Divac should have his heart set on the Providence talent with any player mock-drafted above him being a solid consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>9) Toronto Raptors: Denzel Valentine</strong></p>\n<p>With most of the big potential guys off the board (Jaylen Brown, Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender), the Raptors should go with a player who can solve many of the issues that are causing them to crater against Cleveland.</p>\n<p>Valentine was a solid three-point shooter in his final two collegiate seasons, with a free throw percentage above 80 percent via <em>Sports-reference.com</em>, suggesting that he’ll be able to continue that production in the NBA. Valentine is also a suburb passer, providing a cure for the Raptors’ inability to move the ball on offense. He gives them some DeMar DeRozan insurance as far as ball-handling, and even if they bring back the USC alumni, Valentine could still perform immediately in a role off the bench.</p>\n<p><strong>10) Milwaukee Bucks: Deyonta Davis</strong></p>\n<p>The Bucks are in need of a center to play with their young guns on the wing, and so far Greg Monroe has not fit the part. Davis’ ability to protect the rim and potential to be a solid rim runner make this a good value pick for the Bucks. He’s still young enough to have dominant upside, and his defensive potential is what the Bucks need next to Jabari Parker who may possibly be a terrible defender his entire career.</p>\n<p>Though Jakob Poeltl might be the better player in a vacuum, Davis’ athleticism makes him a better fit for the switching of the Bucks run on defense. If his jumper continues to develop, he could even play some spot minutes alongside Greg Monroe, covering up the big man’s defensive weaknesses.</p>\n<p><strong>11) Orlando Magic: Skal Labissiere</strong></p>\n<p>Labissiere gives the Magic another shot at blue-chip talent, and if he were to pan out, he is a perfect fit next to either Aaron Gordon or Nikola Vucevic. His shooting would open the floor for both big men, and his potential shot blocking would cover up for Vucevic’s defensive failures.</p>\n<p>The Magic hope to do well in free agency, and with Frank Vogel’s impact on a young, improving roster they should be back in the playoffs next season. The Magic have a great young core two to four players deep, ergo they can aim high for a guy who many had ranked as the presumptive No. 1 pick going into the college season.</p>\n<p><strong>12) Utah Jazz: Wayne Baldwin IV</strong></p>\n<p>An impressive ball handler who plays with energy, Baldwin was one of the most prolific overall college players statistically in 2015-16 according to Kevin Pelton of <em>ESPN.com</em>. Baldwin gives the Jazz depth in Exum’s first season back from a torn ACL, and if both players improve their shot somewhat, they could play together in a lineup with two capable, aggressive ball-handlers.</p>\n<p>While shooting guards Furkan Korkmaz and Malachi Richardson possibly offer a wider range of potential and give Utah the ability to amass depth on the wing. Point guard was the biggest issue for the Jazz last year and they should look to address that problem with another young building block.</p>\n<p><strong>13) Phoenix Suns: Henry Ellenson</strong></p>\n<p>The Suns grab a talented prospect in Ellenson, who may well go in the top ten, but they seem too slow on defense and may be defined as too one-dimensional at the four to warrant such a high selection. That said, the young power forward is very skilled, has a decent shooting touch and, at nineteen years old, could develop into a steal at the 13th spot for Phoenix.</p>\n<p><strong>14) Chicago Bulls: Jakob Poeltl</strong></p>\n<p>Poeltl is a great fit for a semi-rebuilding Bulls team in need of a replacement for the free-agent Pau Gasol. The center out of Utah has a short standing reach and wingspan, along with an old-school game that makes him undraftable in the top 10. In a defined role, however, he could develop into the big body that Nikola Mitotic needs alongside him in order to be effective. If Poeltl can continue to refine his body and give arduous effort while on the floor, the Bulls could end up with the best center in the draft with the final lottery selection.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71715\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/2016-nba-mock-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71715\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/2016-nba-mock-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/2016-nba-mock-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/2016-nba-mock-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/2016-nba-mock-draft/","id":3313,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3312,3311,3310],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Freak is Back","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lat-sp-tim-lincecum-angels-wre0039352412-20160623.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lat-sp-tim-lincecum-angels-wre0039352412-20160623.jpg?resize=650%2C366&ssl=1","description":"Tim Lincecum has made his way back to the MLB and with a strong outing in his first appearance in an Angels uniform, staff writer Antonia Bird believes the Freak is back.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At just 5 feet 11 inches and barely over 165 pounds, major league pitcher Tim Lincecum does not appear to be an imposing figure on the baseball mound. But with a fastball that consistently clocked in around the high 90s and a freakish breaking ball that made even the best professional hitters look like minor league washouts, Tim Lincecum was the best pitcher in baseball during a six-year run that saw him earn three world series championships, two Cy Young awards, two no-hitters, three strikeout titles and four All-Star appearances with the San Francisco Giants.</p>\n<p>The slightly built Lincecum, who grew up playing baseball in the neighborhood parks of Bellevue, Washington, was the centerpiece of a dominating Giants pitching staff from 2008-2014.</p>\n<p>His quirky delivery that produced a 98 mph fastball combined with pinpoint control and an uncanny ability to change speeds and locations, gained him a reputation as the best pitcher in baseball and ultimately garnered the nickname “The Freak.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Gregory Bull / Associated Press</p></div>\n<p>As dominating as The Freak was during his six-year reign, the last year of his career was anything but. He struggled with his control in 2015, and his once vaunted high 90s fastball had lost its punch.</p>\n<p>He was giving up runs in bunches, and the losses began to pile up as a result. He eventually lost his job in the starting rotation and questions swirled about whether he had reached the end of his career.</p>\n<p>Lincecum soon found himself out of professional baseball after not resigning with the Giants at the end of the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>In the offseason, doctors discovered a problem with the former two-time Cy Young winner’s hip. After a successful procedure, baseball writers quickly started presuming maybe the hip was the problem all along. Hopes began to rise that maybe Lincecum could dominate the big leagues once again.</p>\n<p>While recovering, Lincecum only thought about his comeback. He spent countless hours rehabbing his injury, attacking his regimen with the fearlessness that marked his professional baseball career.</p>\n<p>He worked hard, trying to find The Freak within his game yet again and fighting to bring himself to the level at which he expected himself to be. Slowly, he was able to take the mound once again. The velocity on his fastball improved, his control became more consistent and he soon began looking like a major league pitcher once again.</p>\n<p>In May of this year, he held a showcase for all major league teams, asking only that they give him a chance to prove his talents yet again. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim liked what they saw and took a chance, signing him to a one-year contract later that month.</p>\n<p>On June 18, Tim Lincecum completed his comeback and took the mound in Oakland against the Athletics. All the previous years’ hard rehabilitation process had led to this moment, and the Washington native did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>In a six-inning effort, Lincecum picked up his first major league win since June 27 of 2015 after allowing only four hits and one earned run while striking out two batters. The six innings were the most he had pitched in a single outing since June 5 of last year as well.</p>\n<p>His hip showed no signs of lasting damage and he attacked major league hitters in a manner reminiscent of his glory days with the Giants.

Mike Ehrmann / Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>So when I took the stance that Curry was the best player in the NBA now, it was not out of spite, it was out of the true belief that I thought No. 30 for the Warriors was the best player.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure he couldn’t rebound or even pass like LeBron, but Steph’s brand of basketball is so much more special than that; it was something the league had never seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before this season, no player in NBA history made 300 three-pointers in a single season; Steph made 402. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry averaged 30.1points per game, the best in the league this season. A huge part of that is the deadly three ball he possesses. No player or team, for that matter, was able to drain the three ball as consistent as the two-time MVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention he also joined the illustrious 50-40-90 club (50 percent shooting from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 90 percent from the free throw line).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He isn’t LeBron, he will never be LeBron, but he was revolutionizing the game before our very eyes — something not even King James could ever do. He was so good that there were talks that a four-point line should be added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, Curry is clutch — or at least was before this NBA Finals — and has made big shots during his career, I mean, who could forget the shot that broke Oklahoma City’s heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, Curry went on to break the hearts of all Golden State fans in the game’s biggest stage: the NBA Finals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry was a disappointment in the Finals, to say the least. If you take out game four where he dropped 38, the NBA’s first unanimous MVP averaged 20 points per game, 10 points below his regular season average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in the biggest game of his career, a game seven at Oracle arena, No. 30 went 6-19 from the field, 4-14 from three, for a mere 17 points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention he had four turnovers, including a boneheaded, unnecessary behind the back pass that went out of bounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also was a big believer that even though LeBron was a way better defender than Curry, the fact is the NBA and its rules are geared toward offense. The art of true defending in the NBA has gone down a significant amount, so I was not going to hold that against Steph.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And Steph’s offense has been so explosive, it can overshadow his, at times, lackluster defense. Plus, he did lead the league in steals (2.1) so at the very least he tries to run around and disrupt plays.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71746\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71746\" data-attachment-id=\"71746\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/more-than-a-loss/636020081040379218-usatsi-9349709/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=534%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"534,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=534%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71746\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?resize=280%2C210\" alt=\"Kyrie Irving's three over Steph Curry with 53 seconds left proved to be the shot that won the championship for the Cavs. Kelley L Cox / USA TODAY Sports\" width=\"280\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?w=534&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kyrie Irving’s three over Steph Curry with 53 seconds left proved to be the shot that won the championship for the Cavs. Kelley L Cox / USA TODAY Sports</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So at the end of game seven, it felt only fitting that the final bucket, scored by Kyrie Irving, came against Stephen Curry, who they had taken advantage of all series. His offensive game couldn’t make up for his defense and it cost him. Not just a game, it cost him a ring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is the MVP came up small on the biggest stage. I don’t want to imply Curry is overrated and has been lucky to this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steph is still great, but he is not the best player in the NBA and he isn’t what we thought he was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like the seven-second Phoenix Suns, it feels like the Cavs, and now the rest of the league figured out how to defend and get the best of him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, it’s possible Curry still could’ve been hurt, but that is no excuse. It’s game seven, you either show up, or you don’t, and he didn’t. </span>To his credit, Curry never once went to his injury as an excuse and even praised LeBron and the Cavs after their game seven victory at Oracle.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that Steph deserved his MVP trophy, 400 three’s speak for themselves. But now, there is also no doubt who the NBA’s best player is. For those who still continue to hate, and doubt the King, keep doing so, but it won’t change the fact he is the league’s most dominant player.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

suffered the same fate after Arizona shut them out 3-0 in Wednesday night’s elimination match.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s season ends with a final record of 43-20-1. The 43 wins are now the most wins against Division 1 opponents in a single season for the Gauchos. They also won seven postseason games, which is more than they had won in their previous seven trips combined.</p>\n<p>Arizona improves to 46-22 on the season and will face Oklahoma State on Friday night. The Wildcats will need to defeat the Cowboys twice in order to advance to the College World Series championship, while Oklahoma State just needs one victory to advance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was another tough day for UCSB as for the second time in the last three games it was shutout and held to single digit hits. In the end, the combination of Arizona pitchers JC Cloney and Cameron Ming proved to be too much as they combined to allow six hits and no runs on the evening.</p>\n<p>It was also a tough outing for redshirt senior pitcher Justin Kelly, who only pitched three innings but allowed seven hits and all three earned runs. It was Kelly’s first start since opening weekend of the season. Though it was not the senior’s best outing of his career, it certainly was not from a lack of effort.</p>\n<p>Another senior on the Wildcats, Ryan Aguilar, started the scoring for his team by hitting a sac fly RBI in the third inning with one out. Then sophomore Jared Oliva came to the plate and knocked it out of the ballpark for a two run homer giving Arizona a 3-0 lead after the third.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Gauchos were able to scatter singles here and there throughout the nine innings, but not with enough consistency in a single frame to score a run. No Santa Barbara hitter was able to register more than one hit on the evening.</p>\n<p>Relieving Kelly was right-hander Trevor Bettencourt who pitched a great game and kept UCSB in it right until the very end. The junior went five innings allowing only one hit, no runs while managing five strikeouts. At one point, Bettencourt had retired 13 consecutive batters.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, Santa Barbara had its best chance to break through as sophomore Clay Fisher had a lead-off double, followed by a redshirt junior Devon Gradford walk, which put the tying run at the plate with no outs.</p>\n<p>However, on this night there was no magical finish. There was no game-saving home run, and there was no win. Ming, a sophomore, put away the Gauchos for good, striking out the final three batters, sophomore first baseman Austin Bush, and redshirt sophomores, second baseman JJ Muno, and catcher Dempsey Grover, in succession to seal the 3-0 win for Arizona.</p>\n<p>Those three batters at the plate for Santa Barbara with a chance to tie the game could not have been any better. Bush leads the team in home runs, Muno is an extra base hit machine and Grover consistently is able to get on base, but this night belonged to Arizona. All three put up good at-bats but the pitching from Ming proved to be too much.</p>\n<p>When the match ended, UCSB finally felt what it had done to Xavier, Louisville and Miami: the feeling of being eliminated. The team that was consistently seen smiling and having fun in the dugout now had the look of melancholy as the reality of their ended season set in.</p>\n<p>Even with the loss, the feats accomplished this entire season should not be forgotten. Eliminating the No. 2 and No. 3 seed in this tournament, making its first Super Regional, going to Omaha for the first time, winning a game in the College World Series; this and more made this UCSB baseball season one for the record books and gave hope to a bright future.</p>\n<p>Although the season is over, and now the Gauchos must look to next year, it was still amazing to see this team defy all odds and reach Omaha when at the beginning no one, not even some of the players, even expected to make a regional.</p>\n<p>After 22 long days on the road, its time for UCSB to come home. Although players and coaches would’ve liked to stay a bit longer, their time is up , and it’s time to go back to the drawing board and figure out a plan for next season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

While it has not always been this way, the “King” has been under a microscope of the public eye since his freshman year at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s High School in Akron, Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a “Kid from Akron,” it was history we witnessed Sunday night as LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers won the franchise’s first NBA title and became the first team ever to win an NBA Finals series despite trailing 3-1. Most notably, the Cavs’ title victory ended the city of Cleveland’s 52-year championship drought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the forefront of Cleveland’s comeback was the NBA’s best player: LeBron James.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzcUmtu_Hs8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning his third championship title and Finals MVP, James successfully defended his throne as champion of the underdogs against a team that many considered to the best ever in the Golden State Warriors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When doubted most, the league’s best produced when it mattered, becoming the first player in NBA Finals history to lead all players in total points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.3 blocks per game in this year’s NBA Finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, the addition of another ring has ignited the ongoing debate with regard to where James ranks amongst NBA greats Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. While he trails Jordan (6) and Bryant (5) in rings, it’s plausible to believe that James could possibly become a member of the notorious ring-holders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An answer to this debate won’t prevail until James retires. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my book, Jordan reigns supreme as basketball’s greatest of all time. With a player like Bryant who modeled his game after “His Airness” and with James paving his own lane with a form of athleticism and versatility that we had never seen, it’s a debate that will still cause dispute when all is said and done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sunday night marked the end of his 13th</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NBA season, James’ chance to further etch his name as one of the game’s greatest is optimal as much more basketball lies ahead in his career. Whether that extra time entails more championship rings will be most enticing in helping judge the King’s legacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how James’ career ends, I’m sure we can all agree that we have never experienced a player with such a universal effect both on and off the court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the weight of the state of Ohio on his shoulders, James delivered in the most dire time which was reflected with tears at the end of a Game 7 victory; tears of a community, city, state … tears of the witnesses that have waited for so long.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/","id":3310,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3309,3308,3307],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":74,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
