UCSB would not be behind for long, however, as it tied it up in the bottom of the third inning.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Arianna Palomares hit a two RBI single through the left side of the infield to score Clark and sophomore outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa.</p>\n<p>The score would remain tied at two apiece until the bottom of the seventh inning as Palomares singled up the middle to drive in the winning run. Junior Ashley Ludlow earned the victory for UCSB after a scoreless 5.1 innings pitched, while junior Chelsea Ponce was charged with the loss for Riverside.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s late game was in a lot of ways the same story. The Gauchos fell behind early, only to charge back in the late innings and secure the victory.</p>\n<p>In the top of the second, senior infielder Taylor Wright hit an RBI sacrifice fly to put Riverside up 1-0. The team would add to its lead in the top of the sixth, as Romero would hit an RBI groundout to take a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offense could only be held down for so long though, as the team broke through for a huge sixth inning. With three runners on, junior catcher MeShalon Moore hit a huge home run to left center giving the Gauchos a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The next batter was Wisdom, who would follow suit with a solo shot of her own. Freshman Lena Mayer picked up her sixth win of the season after allowing just five hits through seven innings. Freshman Rebecca Faulkner took the loss for Riverside after giving up back-to-back home runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could not produce enough late offense in Saturday’s opener, as Riverside jumped out to another early lead. Faulkner hit an RBI sacrifice fly to right and a couple of unearned runs crossed the board to give Riverside a 3-0 lead in the top of the first.</p>\n<p>Wright and senior infielder Kris DeAnda would both double in the top of the fifth to add to Riverside’s lead. Facing a 6-0 deficit, Palomares managed to hit an RBI single in the bottom of the fifth and Hinojosa had an RBI ground out in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>The offense proved too little too late and Ludlow was charged with the loss for UCSB after allowing four earned runs through 4.2 innings pitched. Ponce earned the win for Riverside, allowing only five hits through 4.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos travel to Long Beach State for their final conference series of the regular season starting this Friday at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63037\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/softball-sends-off-seniors-with-walk-off-win-in-last-home-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63037\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/softball-sends-off-seniors-with-walk-off-win-in-last-home-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/softball-sends-off-seniors-with-walk-off-win-in-last-home-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/softball-sends-off-seniors-with-walk-off-win-in-last-home-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/softball-sends-off-seniors-with-walk-off-win-in-last-home-game/","id":80,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[79,78,77],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns First Big West Sweep, Moves Into First Place Tie","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baseball-UCDavis_Hari-Patel_05012015-0671119-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baseball-UCDavis_Hari-Patel_05012015-0671119-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB moves into a tie for first place in the conference with a sweep of UC Davis over the weekend.

After a scoreless ninth from both teams, the game was forced into extra innings.</p>\n<p>The game remained scoreless through the top of the 13th when a single by freshman first baseman Kyle Plantier turned into the winning run, hit in by redshirt sophomore Paddy O’Brien to win the game.</p>\n<p>“I’m seeing the ball well right now and going up with a good approach, and trying to have quality at-bats,” O’Brien said. “These games are big right now, and we’re taking it one inning at a time.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore righty Shane Bieber started Sunday’s game and pitched through eight innings, allowing three runs off six hits while striking out six Aggies. Freshman lefty Kyle Nelson entered the game in hopes of a one-inning win, but after four consecutive scoreless innings from the Gaucho lineup, Nelson ended the game with five perfect innings pitched. Nelson faced 15 batters and struck out five for his third win of the season.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to know [Checketts] trusts me to get out of these tough situations that we get ourselves into. It’s always fun to pitch in really close games,” Nelson said. “I try not to make the situation too big mentally. I go one pitch at a time and keep myself calm and composed and really go after people.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos nearly shut out the Aggies in a 4-1 UCSB victory. Junior lefty Justin Jacome got the start and win during Saturday’s game advancing his record to 7-3.<br>\nJacome allowed the single Aggies run off three hits while striking out seven in his eight overall innings pitched. Junior lefty Domenic Mazza took over for the one-inning save in the ninth after facing only three Davis batters.</p>\n<p>“This was a battle. Davis really had a good team, its pitching got tremendously better from last year,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gaucho offense put 11 hits on the board for their four runs scored. After this weekend, the Gaucho lineup continues to lead the conference in collective batting average as it hits for .297.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, both redshirt senior outfielder Luke Swenson and sophomore designated hitter Billy Fredrick had one RBI and went 2-3 on the day. Swenson also accounted for one of the runs scored.</p>\n<p>“I’d like us to do a better job with runners in scoring position. Our power numbers aren’t up there so we’re going to have to steal more bases,” Checketts said. “We got 14 hits today, and if you’re going to hit a single, you better be able to steal a base to get into scoring position. We did OK today with it, but I think we could have done it better and put more pressure on them.”</p>\n<p>Junior righty Dillon Tate opened up the series against Davis on Friday in his seventh win of the season. Tate added seven strikeouts to his record and allowed two runs off five hits in his eight innings pitched. Nelson recorded a ninth inning save following Tate.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense put up three runs and 10 hits against Davis’s 6-5 senior righty Spencer Koopmans. Koopmans went for six innings before handing the ball over to the Aggie bullpen. Senior infielder Woody Woodward went two-for-four and recorded a triple in Friday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play their last home midweek game on Tuesday against CSU Bakersfield before going on the road to face tough Big West opponent Cal State Fullerton next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Looking to extend his undefeated streak and self-proclaimed title of being boxing’s best, the tale of the tape has Mayweather and Pacquiao matched up pretty evenly.</p>\n<p>As the prime of both boxers’ careers comes to nearing an end, Saturday’s match remains as a fight between the top two fighters in boxing. Mayweather, at age 38, is just two years older than Pacquiao (36). Other assets such as height and reach possess more significance when comparing the two.</p>\n<p>Mayweather has the upper hand in both categories at 5’8” and a five-inch advantage in reach at 72.” Although Pacquiao stands at 5’6 ½” with a reach of 67,” his left-hand fighting stance, better known Southpaw, is the primary concern for “TMT’s” head honcho.</p>\n<p>Known for being a defensive guru that has mastered the art of counter-punching, Mayweather has constantly outsmarted opponents with his patient approach. He tends to bait opponents while ducking and dodging until he finally finds that “sore spot” to pick at. Apparently this technique has been of value with the result of no losses, but Mayweather just might have to step outside of his comfort zone in his duel with the “Pacman.”</p>\n<p>It has been nearly three years since Mayweather’s last knockout. His controversial knockout of Victor Ortiz is the lasting glimpse we have of Mayweather putting someone on the canvas. Although Mayweather is known for his defensive trademark, earning his 48th victory may come down to a knockout.</p>\n<p>His advantage in reach possibly will provide him with the sufficient amount of spacing to put Pacquiao to sleep. But the pursuit of a knockout comes at a price as Pacquiao will undoubtedly stun Mayweather with some punches if he decides to become more offensively dependent.</p>\n<p>Pacquiao is known for his attacking style in the boxing ring and seems ready to go toe-to-toe with Mayweather. His aggressiveness to throw punches and land them will be key in the fight.</p>\n<p>Pacquiao contains a more lethal power punch than Mayweather, but it’s the amount of punches per round that he can land that is key. His ability to consistently outpunch Mayweather could be of benefit on the judges’ scorecards. Still, Pacquiao must remain accurate and not allow his aggressiveness to become reckless punches that could be beneficial to Mayweather.</p>\n<p>While the heroic story of Pacquiao, the “good guy,” beating Mayweather the “bad guy” would be a heartwarming ending to the ongoing beef between the two, let’s be realistic.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Another year, another first round of the playoffs and yet another sorry Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Every year, we see the same story: The “Wild West” boasts a large number of 50-win teams, while the East has about one or two teams that have just a slim chance of challenging whatever squad LeBron James is on. The rest of the East is just there to fill the void.</p>\n<p>In fact, excluding the lockout shortened 2011-12 season, the last time the East didn’t have at least one playoff team at or below .500 was all the way back in 2005!</p>\n<p>The last time the West had a team below .500 in a full season? All the way back in 1997. Back when Kobe Bryant hadn’t even grown his first afro. Back when Michael Jordan was still winning championships with the Bulls. That long ago.</p>\n<p>Nobody wants to see teams with losing records getting swept out of the first round like some sad formality. I know I don’t. I’m sure Charles Barkley doesn’t either. And his opinion matters.</p>\n<p>Why should OKC not get a chance to play in May with a record of 45-37 when you have the Brooklyn Nets six games under .500 at 38-44 getting a chance to upset the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks?</p>\n<p>And this brings me to my next point. Since teams in the East play three or four games against each other while they only play the West two times a year, how will we ever know how good the East really is?</p>\n<p>Sure, the Hawks can take the No. 1 seed going an impressive 60-22, but does that even mean anything? To me, it means that their strength of schedule was a whole lot easier than OKC’s. Who knows what Russell Westbrook and the Thunder could have accomplished if they were located just a couple states to the right.</p>\n<p>To prove my point, the aforementioned Brooklyn Nets, who entered their first round series with Atlanta with a sizable 22-win margin between the two teams, managed to send the series back to Atlanta for Game 5 tied 2-2.</p>\n<p>The Hawks have since taken a 3-2 lead, but let’s get one thing straight: home-court advantage or not, I don’t think Atlanta is scaring anyone in the conference finals. And we all know who is most likely going to be waiting for them there, unless the Bulls can finally get past “The King”.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Chicago has only helped prove my point even more, dropping two straight games to the extremely talented (not really) Milwaukee Bucks, who claimed the six seed with a 41-41 record.</p>\n<p>Where would these teams be if they had to play three or four games against Western Conference teams throughout the season? My guess is closer to the Lakers’ record these past two years. Sorry Laker fans, it hurts me, too.</p>\n<p>So the question of when, if ever, the NBA will reformat the playoff seeding structure to create a fairer set of matchups continues to be asked. Luckily for those poor fans of middling-Western-Conference-past who have had to look at the standings and say “Darn, we didn’t make it this year, but if we were in the East we would’ve had home-court advantage!” NBA commissioner Adam Silver has already claimed that he will be “looking into restructuring” the playoff structure.</p>\n<p>Why hasn’t this been looked into in the past? I blame David Stern, but then again I blame him for everything. I blame him for ruining the end of Kobe’s career, I blame him for making the Clippers the team to cheer for in L.A., I blame him for when I stubbed my toe getting out of the shower this morning. I wouldn’t be surprised if he and Donald Sterling were related, and I’m not sure if that even makes sense. I just don’t like the man.</p>\n<p>But on a more serious note, the end of this poorly-structured playoff setup may be nearing its end, or at least on its way to some improvements. Unless, of course, Silver is just biding his time until the conferences balance out a bit and he doesn’t have to change anything.</p>\n<p>Either way, I’m just happy I’m not a fan of a No. 9, 10, or 11 seed in the West that has to watch from home as a team like the Nets goes toe-to-toe with the East’s finest in Atlanta. I’m proud to cheer on my Lakers and their 14th-best standing in the West. Go big or go home, baby.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>First Round Just as Exciting as Ever</strong></p>\n<p><em>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</em></p>\n<p>Last year’s NBA Playoffs were definitely one to remember, especially in that first round that drew five game sevens. The action was exciting, there were quality teams and both Kevin Durant and Paul George were active and lively. There was nothing not to love about last year’s playoffs, but as we have moved to this year’s postseason, there is definitely a dissonance that has been ignited by the past action.</p>\n<p>NBA fans have become completely spoiled by the insanity that was first round last year and we have become unappreciative of the great basketball that is being played just before our eyes simply because more than half of the series aren’t headed to a sudden death game and the series are little more one-sided.</p>\n<p>What us fans need right now is to think back to before last year’s playoffs, when we were actually gracious for such a postseason. This year, everything is different and we should treat it as such, which means realizing how to enjoy this excitement from this year’s perspective.</p>\n<p>I mean just look at the No. 1 seeds this year, which held the sixth and eighth seeds in 2014 and took first round exits. We don’t even have any of the same players in the MVP race and three of the teams that made the conference finals last year (Miami, Indiana, Oklahoma City) didn’t even make it to the postseason.</p>\n<p>If you are like me and hail from SoCal, I hope that you were able to enjoy the Warriors vs. Pelicans series since it was actually a fun series. Yes, I know you’re tired of the Warriors and you’re afraid of the subsequent trash-talk from your NorCal housemates, but please don’t think that they walked through that series.</p>\n<p>The average margin of victory for Golden State in that series was just eight points over New Orleans. If the No. 1 seed in the conference with the NBA’s best record only beats the eighth seed by eight points a game, then the Western Conference must be as powerful as they say it is. Don’t let a series let you think otherwise simply because one team got swept.</p>\n<p>We got to see what kinds of things the mighty Warriors struggle with, such as guarding someone like Anthony Davis, who held the best stat line out of any player in the first round so far. He averaged 31.5 points, 11 boards, three blocks and a little over one steal while shooting 54 percent from the field in his first playoffs series ever. The kid really showed that he belongs not only in the league, but also in the places of the league where the lights shine the brightest.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Warriors there isn’t anyone else like A.D. in the NBA, but we’ll see how they can handle the duo of Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol.</p>\n<p>So on the West side of the bracket we had a sweep, but what about the East side? We had two of them and they were both even more interesting than the Warriors’ win.</p>\n<p>Washington took everybody by surprise after being the only team to snatch up any wins on the road and played even better when they got home, where they have struggled. The Wizards didn’t have much of a second half to their season, which led people to pick the Raptors to win or at least make the series go longer than four games. Washington showed up though and now has a record of 8-1 as the five seed in the last two years in the first round.</p>\n<p>The Cavs had the other sweep, and the hasty drama that followed made it all the more fun to watch. Although they won all four games, it got very chippy and the injury to K-Love could make that Celtics series hold a little more weight to the Cavs’ performance going forward.</p>\n<p>Away from these sweeps, we truly have many series that are playing out just how we love them to. There are still two series out East that have yet to be decided, and along with that, the Clippers and Spurs are making the Playoffs amazing on their own!</p>\n<p>Look, I know it’s not the same as last year’s playoffs but that doesn’t means it’s any less exciting, it’s just different. Let’s start being real fans again and enjoy what the league has in store for us. Let’s be gracious, not greedy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 30, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/nba-playoffs-a-closer-look-at-the-first-round/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/nba-playoffs-a-closer-look-at-the-first-round/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/nba-playoffs-a-closer-look-at-the-first-round/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/nba-playoffs-a-closer-look-at-the-first-round/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/nba-playoffs-a-closer-look-at-the-first-round/","id":843,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[842,841,840],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Gain Ground in League Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Baseball hosts the Aggies in three-game conference series, looking to improve on second place standing","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62919\" style=\"width: 5194px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baseball-vs.-LMU-2015-28-4-4-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1525607397\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62918\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62919\" data-attachment-id=\"62919\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/gauchos-look-to-gain-ground-in-league-against-uc-davis/luke-swenson-is-up-to-bat-jose-ochoadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baseball-vs.-LMU-2015-28-4-4-print.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"Jose Ochoa\\/DailyNexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T3i\",\"caption\":\"Luke Swenson is up to bat.

Davis, now 26-16-1 overall and 5-7 in conference play, has worked its way up to place sixth in the Big West behind Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“[Tuesday] was a mentality game — it’ll test your mental toughness and I think that it definitely made us tougher and it made us hungrier because we didn’t get the win,” redshirt senior outfielder Luke Swenson said. “I think we’re going to be hungrier to win some games this weekend.”</p>\n<p>In Big West play, the UCSB starting pitching staff has filled the conference leaderboard with consistency this season. As of this week, three UCSB starters are tied with six game wins this season. Those six wins apiece are good enough to take the third through fifth spot in most wins by a Big West pitcher this year.</p>\n<p>However, leading the charge on that same leaderboard is redshirt junior righty Max Cordy of UC Davis. Cordy holds eight wins this season but only crests the top 30 in overall earned run average, coming in at number 29 with a 4.50 E.R.A.</p>\n<p>“This is a big weekend. They’ve been playing well, they’re good offensively and we are good on the mound,” Checketts said. “We need to be on it and we need to be able to play Gaucho baseball: throw strikes and play catch. They will put more pressure on us that there has been in a while.”</p>\n<p>All four UCSB starting pitchers are throwing under a 2.50 ERA. Junior righty Dillon Tate is leading his team in both ERA and total strikeouts as he is throwing for a 1.57 ERA and has struck out 77 batters this year.</p>\n<p>“I feel good [about this weekend]. We’ve been playing pretty well in conference, and we even played pretty well [Tuesday],” Swenson said. “We have a very good chance to win some games this weekend.”</p>\n<p>In the Big West this season, there are few teams who pose as outliers in conference play records. While Irvine sits at the top with an 11-4 record and Riverside rounding out the conference at 2-10, the rest of the pack is anyone’s game as the remaining teams have each won at least five games and eight at the most.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to need some [defensive] practice, that’s the only way you’re going to get better,” Swenson said. “But we’ll get better every day. We can’t stay complacent with where we’re at right now. We have to get better, and work on the things we need to.”</p>\n<p>Offensively for the Gauchos, senior outfielder Cameron Newell still holds the best Big West batting average, hitting .374. Junior first baseman and pitcher Robby Nesovic’s 34 RBIs still holds the third most RBIs of any Big West hitter this season. The UCSB lineup is collectively hitting for a .295 batting average.</p>\n<p>At the plate for the Aggies, redshirt senior infielder Nick Lynch is hitting .371 this season with two home runs and 25 doubles.</p>\n<p>The weekend series begins at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium Friday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 30, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/gauchos-look-to-gain-ground-in-league-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/gauchos-look-to-gain-ground-in-league-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/gauchos-look-to-gain-ground-in-league-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/gauchos-look-to-gain-ground-in-league-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/gauchos-look-to-gain-ground-in-league-against-uc-davis/","id":4734,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4733,4732,4731],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Prepares for Final Homestand, Takes on UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos will close out their home schedule when they take on the Highlanders this weekend","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62925\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Softball_vsUCD-20150418-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1244421983\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62947\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62925\" data-attachment-id=\"62925\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/ucsb-prepares-for-final-homestand-takes-on-uc-riverside/softball_vsucd-20150418-dustinharris-17-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Softball_vsUCD-20150418-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"8\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Senior Shelby Wisdom connects with a pitch, sending it flying.

Junior pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched masterfully in Saturday’s finale, allowing just one run through seven innings.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB still sports an ERA of 5.52 and averages only 2.86 strikeouts per game.</p>\n<p>However, the past weekend was a big step and the Gaucho pitching staff will look to continue their success against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>This task will not be easy as Riverside averages 4.4 runs per game and the team has five players hitting .300 or above this season, including sophomore infielder Haley Harris.</p>\n<p>Harris is hitting .329 this season and leads the team with 34 runs scored thus far. Harris also provides much needed speed on the base path, as she has stolen 10 bases and hit five triples this season.</p>\n<p>While Harris is a threat, the Gauchos must take extra caution when facing freshman infielder/pitcher Rebecca Faulkner. Faulkner is batting .321 this season and leads the team with nine home runs and 40 RBI. She also leads the team with a .579 slugging percentage and an on-base percentage of .405.</p>\n<p>“Riverside is really aggressive and they have a lot of speed,” sophomore outfielder Kristen Clark said. “We have to keep hitting and keep them from taking extra bases.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s pitchers may get all they can handle, the Gauchos have some firepower of their own that always puts pressure on opponents. As a team, the Gauchos are hitting .306 with a .408 slugging percentage and 22 home runs this season.</p>\n<p>Clark has been red hot with the bat for UCSB, boasting a .436 average and leading the team with nine runs scored thus far in conference games. Clark also leads all starters with a .466 on-base percentage in conference games.</p>\n<p>Junior catcher MeShalon Moore has also been stellar at the plate during conference play this season. She is averaging .383 and leads the team with three home runs and a .638 slugging percentage.

As the team with the best record in the regular season, the Warriors are many peoples’ pick to win the NBA Championship this year and now they wait for the other series to finish up to find out who their next opponent is. Here are some thoughts from the series as well as what the Warriors have to do to keep the train rolling in the next round:</p>\n<p><b>The Warriors showed they could handle being down in games</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In game two, the Pelicans took a 13 point lead in the first quarter, and with starters Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green on the bench, it was the 33 year-old veteran Leandro Barbosa with his 12 points in the game who led the charge to give the team a one point lead going into halftime. Thompson and Curry took over in the second half, with the Splash Brothers amounting for 48 points total.</p>\n<p>Game three saw the Warriors go down big again, this time needing a twenty-point comeback in the fourth quarter. Curry scored 40 points in the game including a ridiculous three-pointer in the final seconds of the game where he got trampled by two Pelicans’ defenders after he fired the shot. No foul was called on the play and the game went into overtime. The Warriors took control in the extra period and went on to win 124-119.</p>\n<p><b>The Splash Brothers are awesome, but don’t forget about Draymond Green</b></p>\n<p>MVP candidate Curry had a fantastic first-round series, averaging 33.7 points per game and Thompson was right behind him with 25 points per game. Both played huge roles and were able to take turns putting the team on their shoulders with the score close and the game on the line.</p>\n<p>With these two players sharing the limelight, it’s easy to look past how big of a role Green had in the series. Averaging 12.8 rebounds per game and 2.5 steals per game, Green played a tremendous role on the defensive front. He also added 15.8 points per game, showing off his size and strength at both ends of the floor. Expect Green to play a large role in the next round as he will be asked to defend the opposing team’s top player, as he did against New Orleans’ Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p><b>Game Plan For Next Series: Keep doing what’s been working</b></p>\n<p>The Warriors will be hunted by whichever team they end up playing. It’s their job to stick to their game plan from the rest of the season. If the Warriors pass and shoot the way they have been doing it all year, I can’t imagine any team being able to beat Golden State in the second round. The Warriors will be well rested and they will have veteran forward David Lee back from a lower back injury.</p>\n<p>Expect a lot of three-balls and for the Warriors to let Curry lead the way. He can dominate any team in the league with his shooting and when doubled teamed he always has an eye for an open teammate.</p>\n<p><b>Most likely second round opponent: San Antonio Spurs</b></p>\n<p>I expect the Warriors’ opponent to be the San Antonio Spurs, and Golden State will have to hope that their series with the Los Angeles Clippers goes the full seven games in order to make the winning team as tired as possible. While they have the advantage in experience, the Spurs are not as talented as they have been in past years and they aren’t getting any younger. The Warriors are too good to lose in the second round, but expect the series to be much more of a challenge than the first one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

yesterday’s faceoff between UCSB and Loyola Marymount in the bottom of the fourteenth inning due to darkness.

Both bullpens were thoroughly exhausted as eight Lion pitchers took the mound for anywhere between 2.2 and .1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Five Gaucho pitchers were played in yesterday’s game, including a start from junior lefty Domenic Mazza. Mazza went through eight innings and allowed seven hits for three run while striking out eight Lion batters. Mazza then turned the ball over to freshman lefty Kyle Nelson who allowed two runs in .1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Domenic threw the ball fine and gave us chances to score more runs, but we didn’t,” Checketts said. “I think that if we had done better with runners in scoring position maybe we would have won that game.”</p>\n<p>The game, now tied five-to-five in the top of the ninth remained scoreless until the final call.  Redshirt freshman Brandon Luper was the final pitcher to throw for the Gauchos in his fifth appearance of the season. Both junior righties Robby Nesovic and Connor Bates also served on the mound in the late innings.</p>\n<p>“You’ve just got to keep playing, keep girding it out and trying to find ways to score but at the same time, not let them score. I’m very proud of our pitching staff and our bullpen,” redshirt senior outfielder Luke Swenson said. “They pitched very well and they kept us in that game. Our defense kind of let us down, but they did all they could to keep us in it.”</p>\n<p>Both dugouts put 12 hits and six runs on the board throughout the long game. Seven Gauchos hitters had at least one hit and five had two hits. Of those hitters, both sophomore designated hitter Billy Fredrick and senior left fielder Cameron Newell went 2-4, and freshman first baseman Kyle Plantier went 2-5. All three had one RBI.</p>\n<p>Nine Lion hitters put up at least one hit against the Gaucho pitching staff. Freshman right fielder and leadoff hitter Sean Watkins went 3-6 and sophomore center fielder Austin Miller went 2-4.</p>\n<p>Only five RBIs were recorded for the Lions as one run was given up due to a throwing error to third base in attempts to pick off a stealing runner. That play, and two others were accounted as errors for the Gauchos. In all UCSB’s four errors was the most recorded in one game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB has had 10 total errors in eight games since junior first baseman Dalton Kelly suffered his broken leg. Before that, the Gauchos were averaging less than one error a game. At the beginning of conference play this season the Gauchos had a five-game streak of no recorded errors.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we will come out angry [next game],” Checketts said. “We came out a little flat for whatever reason and hopefully we’ll come out with a little more intensity this weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returned home early Monday morning from its series in Hawaii. Adding the long and seemingly unfruitful draw in yesterday’s game to the equation, the team is up for a long week ending in conference play this weekend.</p>\n<p>“It was tough [today], we got back home early yesterday morning and I think everybody slept all day,” Swenson said. “I think there may have been some cobwebs and guys were a little sleepy this morning, but the game doesn’t care, and we’ve got to go out there and try to find some energy.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are scheduled to continue their long week at home in a three-game series against Davis this weekend starting Friday at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62910\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/stadium-lighting-forces-ucsb-and-lmu-to-end-as-draw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62910\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/stadium-lighting-forces-ucsb-and-lmu-to-end-as-draw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/stadium-lighting-forces-ucsb-and-lmu-to-end-as-draw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/stadium-lighting-forces-ucsb-and-lmu-to-end-as-draw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/stadium-lighting-forces-ucsb-and-lmu-to-end-as-draw/","id":4381,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4380,4379,4378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Maintain Perfect Midweek Record Versus Loyola Marymount","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baseball_vsCalPoly-20150419-Jose-Ochoa-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baseball_vsCalPoly-20150419-Jose-Ochoa-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After winning last weekend's series, UCSB returns home for a one-game matchup against the Lions.

The staff reached a season-low 2.12 overall ERA.</p>\n<p>In his first appearance since being scratched from the Northridge series, Tate owned the mound against Hawaii last Friday, remaining hitless through 7.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Tate maintains a 1.57 ERA through his 74.2 total innings pitched this season. All four UCSB starters hold ERAs under 2.50 and each own a winning record as well.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos lineup now holds the top two batting averages in the conference. The first belonging to Newell, who is hitting for a season-high .371. The second is held by junior first baseman and right-handed closer Robby Nesovic.</p>\n<p>Nesovic previously paced the league in batting average, however, an out-standing offensive weekend from Newell was enough for him to take the Big West lead. Newell went 3-for-4 in both wins against Hawaii last weekend, and Nesovic recorded two of the four total Gaucho hits during Saturday’s loss.</p>\n<p>With 34 RBIs this season, Nesovic is also tied for second for most RBIs hit this season with Cal Poly’s senior outfielder Zack Zehner. Other Gauchos leading offensive conference leaderboards include sophomore outfielder and leadoff hitter Andrew Calica, whose 12 stolen bases this year account for the fourth most stolen bases by any Big West player.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ collective .296 batting average still holds a narrow lead over UC Davis for best batting average in the conference. The UCSB lineup also holds the best on-base percentage and most RBIs.</p>\n<p>Up to bat for the Lions, sophomore infielder David Fletcher leads his team with the highest batting average. Fletcher is hitting for .328 this season, and in his 174 at-bats he has drawn a team-high 22 walks.</p>\n<p>Today’s home game is scheduled for 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/gauchos-look-to-maintain-perfect-midweek-record-versus-loyola-marymount/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/gauchos-look-to-maintain-perfect-midweek-record-versus-loyola-marymount/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/gauchos-look-to-maintain-perfect-midweek-record-versus-loyola-marymount/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/gauchos-look-to-maintain-perfect-midweek-record-versus-loyola-marymount/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/gauchos-look-to-maintain-perfect-midweek-record-versus-loyola-marymount/","id":4384,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4383,4382,4381],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Claims Second Big West Title in Three Years","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB took down UC Irvine 4-3 to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62805\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.1-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1751242911\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62817\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62805\" data-attachment-id=\"62805\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/mens-tennis-claims-second-big-west-title-in-three-years/ziad-sultan-hits-the-ball-towards-his-opponent-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.1-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Ziad Sultan hits the ball towards his opponent.

The Gauchos defeated both Hawaii and UC Davis to make it to the final, where they topped UC Irvine 4-3 to hoist the trophy.</p>\n<p>With three wins in the tournament, Santa Barbara improves to an overall record of 15-9 and extends its win streak to four straight.</p>\n<p>The first match of the tournament for the three-seeded Gauchos came against the sixth-seeded Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. Earlier in the regular season, Santa Barbara downed Hawaii at home 6-1, and on this past Thursday, it put on a similar performance. The Gauchos took a 4-0 victory and play was stopped for resting purposes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos started off the day battling with the Warriors in the doubles point. Hawaii grabbed a quick win on court three and needed just one more doubles victory to go up 1-0. The senior duo of Ziad Sultan and Tobias Galskov evened the score up with their 6-3 victory on court two. The Gauchos were then able to capture the doubles point with a 6-4 win on the number one court by junior Nathan Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson.</p>\n<p>With a 1-0 victory, the Gauchos moved on to the singles round and took three straight set victories on the lower courts to seal the 4-0 win. On court four, freshman Cody Rakela took a 6-3, 6-4 victory and Johnsson finished with the same score on court five. Sophomore Teague Hamilton took the last win with ease 6-1, 6-1 on court six. With this win, the Gauchos looked ahead to a rematch with second-seeded UC Davis.</p>\n<p>The Aggies beat out the Gauchos in their regular season matchup just a few weeks ago by a close score of 4-3 in Davis. The story was much different this time around when the two teams met at in this neutral setting, and Santa Barbara took a 4-1 win to advance to the final round.</p>\n<p>In the doubles round, UCSB once again showed its dominance as all three doubles teams held leads, and the wins came down to who could finish first. The duo of Eshmade and Johnsson added a 6-3 win and a 6-4 victory from sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton sealed the point. Galskova and Sultan were stopped with a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos again took some help from their players on the lower courts when they headed into the singles round. Hamilton and Johnsson added victories for the second straight day to put their team up 3-0 over the Aggies. Hamilton won 6-2, 7-6 on court six and Johnsson triumphed in three sets on court five 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.</p>\n<p>Galskov, reclaiming his spot on court one, ended the match and sent his team to final round to take on the first seeded UC Irvine Anteaters with a straight set win of 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p>In the final match of the Big West Tournament, UCSB would again get a chance to beat a team that downed them during the regular season by the close score of 4-3. The Gauchos got their revenge, delivering the Eaters a 4-3 loss and bringing the Big West title back to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started off the finals match just as they had done the previous two, with a win in the doubles round. Eshmade and Johnsson grabbed the first match easily on court one with a score of 6-2, but the Eaters were able to take away the match on court three. The senior captains, Sultan and Galskov, came through for their team with a 6-4 win that put UCSB up 1-0.</p>\n<p>Singles play faired the Gauchos in the earlier part of the day as the team quickly took control of match. Freshman Cody Rakela added his second singles win of the tournament in straight sets of 7-6, 6-4 on court four. Johnsson fell early losing his first set 6-0, but battled back to win the next two 6-2, 6-3 on court five. These two wins put the team up 3-0 and the victory seemed inevitable.</p>\n<p>With just one more win needed, the Gauchos dropped singles matches on courts one, three, and six, and Irvine was right back in the game tying the score at 3-3. The match and the title came down to Eshmade playing on court two. The junior from Australia was downed 6-7 in the first set and needed the next two to win the tournament for his team. He kept himself alive winning the second set 6-4 and sealed history UCSB winning the third and final set 6-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB took home its second tournament title in just three years and grabbed its ninth in school history. With this accomplishment, the Gauchos will be heading to the NCAA tournament May 8th. Seeding is yet to be decided.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

The loss ended a season of disappointment, as the squad was not able to live up to preseason predictions and the returners must contemplate how to improve until the beginning of next year.</p>\n<p>“We played as hard as we could; it just wasn’t our night,” senior outside hitter Weston Nielson said. “Credit to Pepperdine, they played a great match.”</p>\n<p>The Waves took the first game 25-21 as the Gauchos hit a measly .133. Pepperdine took control of the set on a five-point run, going from up 7-6 to 12-6 with senior outside hitter Josh Taylor at the service line. Senior opposite Parker Kalmbach led the Waves with three kills in the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Game two went point for point with neither team holding a bigger lead than two points. The Waves took a 17-15 lead and looked poised to run away with the game. UCSB called a timeout and senior outside hitter Kevin Donohue got two straight kills to tie the game.</p>\n<p>The teams went back and forth until at 22-22, Kalmbach got a kill to take a one-point lead. On the next point, Donohue hit the ball into senior setter Matt West and sophomore middle blocker Mitchell Penning strong block on the left side. Down 22-24 Donohue got a kill to bring the Gauchos to within one point of the tie. On the next point senior outside hitter Scott Rhein ended the game with a kill to go up two games to none, 25-23.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t hit our serves,” Nielson said. “No one had a good serving game and they were able to run the offense that they wanted.</p>\n<p>After narrowly losing the second game, UCSB crumpled in the second half of the third set. Down 16-17, instead of bouncing back to take the lead, the Gauchos dismantled themselves on three attacking errors in the next five points to go down 22-16. The lead was insurmountable and Pepperdine won the set 25-18 on an attacking error from Nielson. Overall, it was a putrid hitting game for UCSB as the Gauchos hit -.40 with seven kills and eight errors.</p>\n<p>Rhein and Kalmbach led the Waves with 12 kills each, while Nielson topped the Gauchos with 11. Junior setter Jonah Seif put up his fifth straight double-double with 29 assists and 10 digs, but with its poor hitting, Santa Barbara was not able to take a game off the Waves, led alone contend for winning the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB was ranked in preseason as the second best team in the MPSF conference and No. 5 in national standings. Injuries hurt the Gauchos this year as they lost senior outside hitter Vaun Lennon and junior opposite Matt Marsh early in the season and were left with a weaker bench than expected.</p>\n<p>It was a tough way for graduating seniors, Nielson, Donohue, and middle blocker Jake Staahl to end their Gaucho careers. Santa Barbara will return four starters in star setter Seif as well as freshman libero Hayden Boehle, sophomore outside hitter Jacob Delson, and junior middle blocker Ryan Hardy, with younger players getting an opportunity to fill the remaining starting roles.</p>\n<p>“I have nothing but love and respect for the seniors,” Seif said. “It’s something each team has to deal with every year in the college game and next year we are gonna need new guys to step up and take on bigger roles.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine moves on in the MPSF tournament to play No. 2 seed Hawaii on Thursday at UC Irvine’s gym. Hawaii won both head-to-head matches in the regular season and look to add to its surprising season by making it to the MPSF finals against the winner of No. 1 UC Irvine and No. 4 USC.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/volleyball-falls-to-pepperdine-in-mpsf-quarterfinal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/volleyball-falls-to-pepperdine-in-mpsf-quarterfinal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/volleyball-falls-to-pepperdine-in-mpsf-quarterfinal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/volleyball-falls-to-pepperdine-in-mpsf-quarterfinal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/volleyball-falls-to-pepperdine-in-mpsf-quarterfinal/","id":5106,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5105,5104,5103],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes Early Exit in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For the third consecutive year, the Gauchos suffer a first round exit","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62801\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/03.01.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensWaterpolo10-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1340227224\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62819\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62801\" data-attachment-id=\"62801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-takes-early-exit-in-big-west-tournament/03-01-15christinademarzowomenswaterpolo10-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/03.01.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensWaterpolo10-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Camila Schafer shoots the ball and scores a point for the Gauchos.

Unfortunately, the Gauchos’ troubles continue for a third year after its 10-9 loss to fifth-seeded No. 8 UC Davis. As both teams exchanged goals, it was the Aggies’ defensive stand in the second period that made the ultimate difference in Friday’s contest.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite the loss, UCSB had one of its best offensive performances as six different players amounted at least one goal. It was a scoring clinic in the first period as both teams combined for a total of seven goals.</p>\n<p>Sophomore attacker Taylor Shore and junior attacker Bryn Hudson opened the match with two quick scores that gave UCSB an early 2-0 lead. Netting the Aggies’ first goal was senior attacker Keelia Houston. Following Houston’s score was a goal by sophomore attacker Brenna Thomas to increase the Gauchos’ lead to 3-1.</p>\n<p>Still, Davis consistently responded with goals of their own as Houston and junior center Allyson Hansen went on to force a 3-3 tie. Giving the Gauchos a 4-3 advantage at the end of the first period was a goal by redshirt freshman utility Tess Wardle.</p>\n<p>The lack of defense to begin the game was a problem that both teams needed to resolve entering the second period. Davis quickly filled the void as it held Santa Barbara scoreless and earned its first lead on scores from freshman utility Paige Virgil and freshman center Greta Kohlmoos to take a 5-4 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Starting the second half of Friday’s matchup was another high-scoring quarter that resulted in a total of nine goals being scored. It was Houston’s three-goal scoring rally in the third period that uplifted the Aggies to an 8-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ comeback were junior utility Samantha Murphy and Shore as both players managed to tally two scores that trimmed Davis’ lead to 8-7. Ending the third period were two scores by sophomore utility Bryn Lutz and junior utility Ariel Arcidiacono that rewarded UC Davis with a 10-8 lead.</p>\n<p>On the verge of being eliminated while facing a two-point deficit, UCSB needed to react quickly in order to keep its season alive.</p>\n<p>With just two minutes left in regulation, Murphy landed a clutch goal to cut the Aggies’ lead to one. While Santa Barbara held UC Davis scoreless in the fourth period, it was too late into the game’s ending for the Gauchos to force a potential overtime.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s chances of playing in the Big West Championship game were ended, Santa Barbara’s last hope in the tournament was its rematch versus sixth-seeded No. 13 Long Beach State to claim fifth place.</p>\n<p>It was an absolute duel between the Gauchos and 49ers as UCSB earned the 10-9 victory in double-overtime. The win gives Santa Barbara its second consecutive fifth-place ending in the tournament and was just the eighth overtime match in Big West Tournament history.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Betsy Hendrix led the Gauchos in scoring with three goals. In a match that had a total of five ties, it was Hudson that scored the game-winning goal for UCSB.</p>\n<p>After a thrilling end to the Big West Tournament, the UCSB women’s water polo team’s season is in the books. Congratulations to first-year Head Coach Serela Kay and the Gauchos women’s water polo team on a successful season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62819\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-takes-early-exit-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62819\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-takes-early-exit-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-takes-early-exit-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-takes-early-exit-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-takes-early-exit-in-big-west-tournament/","id":5401,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5400,5399,5398],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Comes Out On Top in Yet Another Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For the fourth straight conference series, UCSB takes two of three","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62804\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015.04.18-StephenManga-Baseball-5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1105974994\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62818\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62804\" data-attachment-id=\"62804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-comes-out-on-top-in-yet-another-series/2015-04-18-stephenmanga-baseball-5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015.04.18-StephenManga-Baseball-5-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Stephen Manga\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Cameron Newell hits a sacrifice bunt to advance the two runners in play.

Freshman shortstop Clay Fisher put up two RBIs with his fourth inning double, driving in senior third baseman Peter Maris and red shirt sophomore catcher Paddy O’Brien. Collectively, the Gaucho offense put up 12 hits in its series closer.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s redshirt senior lefty Jarrett Arakawa was recorded as Sunday’s losing pitcher after his 3.1 inning appearance allowing nine hits for all five Gaucho runs.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, UCSB dropped its only game of the weekend in a 1-0 shutout in favor of the Warriors. Though junior lefty Justin Jacome put up a full eight innings, the Gaucho lineup could not offer any offensive support for its pitcher.</p>\n<p>Jacome faced 28 batters, striking out seven and allowing only five hits for one run. Like Bieber on Sunday, Jacome did not allow any bases on balls. With the loss on Saturday, Jacome’s record falls to 6-2.</p>\n<p>The double-digit hits seen on both Friday and Sunday was absent on Saturday, as the UCSB lineup put up only four hits. Two of those four hits came from junior first baseman and right-handed closer Robby Nesovic, and the other two from Maris.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s winning pitcher, junior righty Tyler Brashears advanced his record to 6-2 after going through 7.2 innings on Saturday and striking out five Gauchos. Brashears now finds himself tied for third with Jacome and junior righty Dillon Tate for most wins in the conference this season.</p>\n<p>On Friday’s series opener, Tate was back on the mound for the Gauchos for the first time since his appearance against Northridge earlier this month. Tate went through seven innings before handing the ball over to freshman lefty closer Kyle Nelson.</p>\n<p>Tate faced 24 batters, allowed no hits, walked two and struck out six. Nelson allowed the Warrior’s two hits of the night and struck out three opposing batters.</p>\n<p>The Guacho lineup put 11 hits for five runs on Friday. Both Newell and Maris had three hits for the night. Maris accounted for one run scored, while Newell put up a solo RBI. Senior catcher Campbell Wear also went 2-4 for the night and accounted for another Gaucho RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior righty LJ Brewster was recorded as the games losing pitcher in Friday’s opener. Brewster went through 6.2 innings pitcher allowing eight hits and four runs while striking out six Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will return home from Hawaii for a weeklong home stand starting with a mid-week game on Tuesday against Loyola followed by a three-game conference series against UC Davis starting Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-comes-out-on-top-in-yet-another-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-comes-out-on-top-in-yet-another-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-comes-out-on-top-in-yet-another-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-comes-out-on-top-in-yet-another-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/ucsb-comes-out-on-top-in-yet-another-series/","id":4383,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4382,4381,4380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morgan Mays: Dedication From a Young Age","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Since transferring to UCSB from Wake Forest, the Malibu native has been one of the key players in the Gauchos’ run to history","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62661\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.2-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"86594438\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62698\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62661\" data-attachment-id=\"62661\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/morgan-mays-dedication-from-a-young-age/morgan-mays-prepares-to-return-the-ball-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.2-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays prepares to return the ball.

Top prospects in tennis gain their rankings and reputation from playing in tournaments and tours, so traveling year round is a necessity.</p>\n<p>To make himself known, Mays had to be truly dedicated. He had to sacrifice attending a public high school, instead attending online to allow him to pursue his love of the sport.</p>\n<p>Luckily, he was able to get a taste of the high school sports experience beforehand due to his undeniable talent. While in just the sixth grade, his first year of middle school, Mays earned a varsity letter competing for Trinity Preparatory High School.</p>\n<p>He found homes in both Florida and California, so moving around all ends of the nation wasn’t unfamiliar. In Florida, he tacked on the accolade of being ranked No. 1 in the state for players 16 and under, and defended that rank with a victory in the Florida State Singles Championship.</p>\n<p>As he traveled, Mays achieved such accomplishments as being labeled a 5-Star recruit, winning three ITF junior singles titles and an ITF junior doubles title. Along with that, he was ranked top-10 nationally throughout his entire junior career in his age group. As his game grew and progressed over this time, the idea of college life came closer and closer.</p>\n<p>“When I was playing at a younger age I hadn’t really thought too much about college,” Mays said. “I was just trying to get better and hit the rankings, but when it came down to deciding on a school, I held education and tennis as my highest priorities.”</p>\n<p>Mays decided to take his talents to Wake Forest University in North Carolina; a university which is well respected for both its academics and its tennis play. During his time there, the Demon Deacons sat in the top-20 of the rankings all season.</p>\n<p>Mays posted a 9-5 overall singles record and helped contribute to a 6-4 stand in doubles play. He found his spot primarily around the fifth and sixth courts, which, although they weren’t the most glamorous spots, are still beyond impressive for a late addition freshman on highly-ranked ACC team.</p>\n<p>“Wake Forest was definitely the right decision for me at that time,” Mays explained. “It was a really great and rare opportunity and I definitely enjoyed it. The academics were great, the people were very friendly, and the adjustment was pretty smooth. On top of that, they have a very successful tennis program and it was great playing in the ACC.”</p>\n<p>Despite enjoying his time as a Deacon and contributing to their elite team, Mays had his sights set on other destinations to pursue success. He searched for a place with a chance to experience his own improvement as an individual while still contributing to the team.</p>\n<p>“I think team success is great and it actually can strongly relate to individual success, so it is definitely important,” Mays said. “I experienced that at Wake Forest and now I was looking for fair opportunity to play higher up so I could have a chance to play in national circuits while still playing for a team.”</p>\n<p>Being a California native, and perhaps a little worn out by the climate change of North Carolina, Mays wanted to return to the West Coast to compete on the court. UCSB presented itself as a strong competitor for his new destination as he still considered the option of returning to Wake Forest.</p>\n<p>After learning of Santa Barbara’s divine Film and Media Studies program, which matched his interest of study, Mays decided to return to the Golden State, just miles from his home in Malibu.</p>\n<p>“The college experience at Santa Barbara speaks for itself, the location speaks for itself and the academics speak for themselves too,” Mays said. “On top of that, the tennis program is very successful and [Head Coach Marty Davis] is a phenomenal coach that has helped many players climb to the next step in the sport.”</p>\n<p>When Mays became a Gaucho just this past season, the opportunities that he had searched for came alive as he found himself playing around the top three spots and mostly holding down the number one spot for his team. He contributed to 11 doubles victories and posted a 13-7 singles record that featured a nine-match win streak.</p>\n<p>Mays’ successes helped push Santa Barbara to a very successful season as the Gauchos climbed as high as No. 60 in the rankings and finished the regular season sitting at No. 62. With a 9-0 home record, they even made history by becoming the first UCSB men’s tennis team to go undefeated at home for the entire regular season.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad that I was able to come to this amazing school and help this program thrive,” Mays said.  “I love the team already and I think we have all of the tools to keep pushing and become a top-30 team in the nation.
