Given the ball on the rubber Sunday, the freshman, who previously had 14 appearances out of the pen this year for the Gauchos, went 3.2 innings pitched giving up two earned runs off four hits.</p>\n<p>Those two runs came off of two solo shots in the bottom of the second off the bats of DH Connor Cannon and second baseman Cody Sporrer. After giving up the long bombs, the young righty would go 1.2 more innings striking out three more batters. In all Lincoln would punchout six UCR batters.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UC Santa Barbara would get things up and going in the top of the third with a sacrifice fly off the bat of centerfielder Tommy Jew scoring Dempsey Grover. In the fourth, the Gauchos would have there almost ceremonial big inning, scoring three runs.</p>\n<p>Getting his first start of the season Sunday, Junior Kyle Plantier would take advantage of his given opportunity by going big fly ya-ya to left center where the big boys live to put the Gauchos ahead. Plantier would collect his first and second RBI on the two-run homer. Following the two-run tater, newly put in relief pitcher Matt Hardy would throw a wild pitch allowing Dempsey Grover to score.</p>\n<p>One more run would be added in the sixth off a Dempsey Grover solo home run. Grover, the Gauchos everyday man behind the dish, would have a day going 3 for 4 while scoring three runs for UCSB. Grover, a Johnny Bench Award candidate, is now hitting .286 with four home runs and 13 RBI after today’s performance.</p>\n<p>Eventually, UCR would find its way into UCSB’s bullpen. After a shutout relief performance from Kevin Chandler, usual Sunday starter Ben Brecht would take the mound. The gentle freshman giant would throw well going 1.1 innings pitched in his first bullpen appearance of the year, but would allow one earned run in the seventh off a single through the right side off the bat of Mark Contreras.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth, things would get interesting. As if suddenly taking plays out of the San Francisco Giants playbook, the bullpen would start to get rocky. Righty Steven Ledesma would be the next guy on the bump for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After allowing two runners on, Ledesma would give up a two-RBII single to Cody Sporrer to left field. Sporrer faired well against Gaucho pitching himself Sunday going 2 for 4 with 3 RBI. Ledesma would get the second out of the inning via fly out to right, but that would be the end of Ledesma’s day. Closer Shea Barry would come in to finish the inning.</p>\n<p>Now with the game tied up by a score of 5 to 5 in the ninth, Tommy Jew would lead off the inning with a triple to left-center field. Eventually getting runners on second and third with one down, Kenny Corey would hit a deep fly ball to centerfield scoring the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly. The inning would soon end short after.</p>\n<p>Barry still on the mound, the Gauchos would need three more out to put away the Highlanders. To lead off the inning AJ Sawyer would hit a bullet into right centerfield. However, Tommy Jew would be there to sell out for his team. Snaring the lined shot in the gap, Jew would lay out, getting parallel to the ground while snow-coning a ball in his glove. Jew would not only have the play of the game on offense but would make the play of the game, maybe even of the year on defense as well.</p>\n<p>Barry would close the door for the Gauchos getting Mark Contreras to strike out and Michael Farris to end the game on a groundout to shortstop JJ Muno. Barry would get the win for the ‘Chos improving his record to 1-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, although improving their record, are still at 5-7 in the conference. UCSB still has a lot of ground to make up if they want a shot at regionals. With its RPI sitting at the high 100’s, a chance at a Regional seems small unless Santa Barbara can get the automatic bid by winning its conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will begin a three-game set at home against the UC Davis Aggies next Friday at 3 p.m. The Gauchos will need a sweep of the series if they hope to keep their playoff hopes alive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77484\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77484\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/","id":4258,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Then, the deciding match took place on court 3 where Freund almost swept Luis Lopez by a score of 6-0 / 6-1. Ultimately, this gave UCSB the three remaining points necessary to take home the early 4-0 win on the day; thus granting them a Big West Championship spot on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defeated second seed UC Davis that same Thursday after a hard fought 4-2 win, therefore earning themselves a visit with UCSB for the second year in a row.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s finals meet almost mirrored the same intensity as these teams’ regular season bout. The day began with the doubles portion, per usual, as court 3 first went in favor of Mustangs Auproux and Damiens by a score of 6-4. UCSB then responded on court 2 with a 6-2 victory by Moreno and Holm.</p>\n<p>Finally, the deciding doubles match was an exciting nail biter on court 1 where Freund / Mays met against Pang / Donovan for perhaps their most important sets of the season. It was a tough competition to watch, but UCSB eventually prevailed by a close victory of 7-6 (3).</p>\n<p>Currently with the doubles advantage point and early 1-0 lead, the Gauchos were just 3 wins away from earning the title through singles play. Cal Poly’s Corey Pang made a quick statement on court 1 with a pair of 6-4 victories, bringing his team back into the meet at a 1-all score.</p>\n<p>Then Holm matched this result with a pair of 6-4’s for himself on court 4. Once again, Freund extended the Gauchos’ lead after a tough 7-6 (6) score, then a 6-0 sweep, on court 3.</p>\n<p>Now, with the meet at 3-1 and in favor of Santa Barbara, the next court to finish would be able to decide the tournament. On court 2, Nicolas Moreno faced off against Ben Donovan as the two battled it out for a three setter.</p>\n<p>Moreno took the first with a smooth 6-0 sweep, but then Donovan clawed back into it with a 6-4 of his own. Then, Moreno earned not only another victory for his team, but the last point necessary to crown UCSB as champions in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>Upon the meet’s conclusion, the ceremony commenced as the Gauchos celebrated a three-peat championship performance. Including the second year in a row in which Santa Barbara topples their rival Cal Poly, in the finals, by a score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>Following last weekend’s results, UCSB’s ITA rankings continue to grow as they are currently hoping for a participant spot in this year’s NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take a short break as they await a tournament at-large bid from the selection committee. Tune in this Tuesday at 2 PM as the Selection Show will inform UCSB of their NCAA Regional game opponent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/mens-tennis-completes-three-peat-fourth-big-west-title-in-five-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/mens-tennis-completes-three-peat-fourth-big-west-title-in-five-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/mens-tennis-completes-three-peat-fourth-big-west-title-in-five-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/mens-tennis-completes-three-peat-fourth-big-west-title-in-five-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/mens-tennis-completes-three-peat-fourth-big-west-title-in-five-years/","id":1199,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1198,1197,1196],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Loses Series at Riverside, Outpaced 9-5 in Game Two of Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_Baseball-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_Baseball-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos give up 15 hits and nine runs in their loss at UC Riverside costing them the series.

After a scoreless fourth by both teams, a pair of runs was netted again by the home squad, this time off of an AJ Sawyer RBI single, and a RBI ground out from Contreras making the score 6-0 after five full innings.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen kicked off the Gaucho sixth with a single to right field. He would come to score on the next hit making the score 6-1 coming off a double from the bat redshirt freshman Tommy Jew who has quickly become one of the brightest spots of UCSB’s young line-up. Despite the 1 for 5 outing, the center fielder is only one of three Gauchos batting above .300 and the only freshman doing so.</p>\n<p>Despite the RBI double with no outs, the Gauchos failed to score any more runs in the inning leaving Jew on base after Highlander pitcher Trenton Toplikar got the next three outs in succession once he replaced Alex Fagalde who is now 6-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>The top half of the next frame, junior first baseman Austin Bush would come to the plate and smack a double to left center scoring two runs making the score 6-3 after seven innings. Bush would finish the day 2 for 4 with 4 RBI’s and has now has improved his hitting streak to five games.</p>\n<p>Again after failing to score more runs despite only having one out in the top of the seventh, the Gauchos had still cut into the lead leaving them with hope of a comeback. UCR took away that hope in the eighth inning as three runs were scored off of junior relief right-handed pitcher Alex Garcia who saw his first action since pitching 0.1 of an inning on April 11th against Nevada.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior catcher Tony Gudino netted two of the three runs with a single to right field before Contreras would attain his third RBI of the day off of another single. Contreras would finish the day 3 for 4 with three runs batted in.</p>\n<p>Not being able to muster even one out, Garcia came out having allowed the three runs. With the UCSB bullpen being the mess that it is, the Gauchos were forced to throw backup catcher Thomas Rowan on the mound to try to get out of the inning.</p>\n<p>Rowan did actually have experience pitching beforehand as in high school in his junior year he was 7-1 with a 1.81 ERA, but facing high schoolers and Division-I college athletes are completely different.</p>\n<p>To the redshirt sophomore’s credit, he did get out of the inning unscathed allowing only two hits but giving up no runs and actually striking out one batter. It was a great sight to see an athlete step up and make plays from a position he is not used too, but being in a position to have to throw Rowan out on the mound is proof of how bad things are in the pen for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final inning down 9-3, UCSB scored two more runs off of another Bush double, but it would obviously not be enough as it would fall 9-5.</p>\n<p>Once again, this loss is indicative of how the Gauchos have lost most of their games: their pitching staff. Being short-staffed is always tough, and having inconsistency from starters and relievers makes any coaches job tougher but UCSB needs to somehow make ends meet.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to miss the postseason which would be very disappointing, and at this point is basically an inevitability, but it’s another entirely if this team never even breaks the .500 bubble.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Andrew Checketts has had a tough go at it this year, but having just been given a contract extension, we know he is here to stay, and at this point, him possibly being able to develop the young talent seems to be the only positive in UCSB baseball.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finish the series tomorrow at 2 p.m. at UCR stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UCSB baseball team is now 4-12 away from home after losing in extra innings at UC Riverside in game one of a three-game set 8-7.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After 11 innings of a back and forth battle, the UCSB baseball team lost 8-7 in heartbreaking fashion against UC Riverside after left-handed relief pitcher Steven Ledesma (1-4, 6.10 ERA), dropped a pop fly in a bases loaded, two out situation.</p>\n<p>This was a hard fought and an upsetting loss for the Gauchos. The road team came out hot and got ahead early in the game, but fell behind by the end of the third inning to trail the Highlanders until the eighth when the Gauchos then rallied by scoring two to tie it up 7-7 and sent it into extras after a scoreless ninth from both dugouts.</p>\n<p>UCSB now has a conference record of 4-6 and an overall record that stands at 18-21, no longer giving the Gauchos the chance they had while sitting at 18-20 to get back to .500 by the end of this weekend’s three-game series. UCR’s victory promotes them to 15-22 overall and a record of 3-10 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Scoring opened right away in the top of the first when UCSB senior left-fielder Billy Fredrick went yard to hit the scoreboard in right-center for his first homer of the year.</p>\n<p>Gauchos starting left-handed pitcher Kyle Nelson (5-3, 4.57 ERA) then swiftly retired the one, two, and three-spot hitters in Riverside’s lineup for a speedy three-up-three-down frame.</p>\n<p>Ahead 1-0, Santa Barbara extended its lead to make it 3-0 in the top of the second. Redshirt junior Kenny Corey singled to right and redshirt freshman Tommy Jew moved him over to third by ripping a double down the left field line. With no outs, redshirt junior JJ Muno roped a single to plate both Corey and Jew but was thrown out by Riverside left fielder AJ Sawyer when attempting to advance to second base.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders then immediately got their second and third outs from the two following Gauchos to end the top of the second and decided to answer back with three runs of their own in the bottom of the inning.</p>\n<p>UCR second baseman Cody Sporrer got up with two outs and smacked a three-run blast off of Nelson down the left field line. The junior took a trip around the bases and scored teammates sophomore Matt Hardy and freshman Connor Cannon for an even score of 3-3.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB monster hitter Austin Bush was not going to let the score remain tied for long. Junior second baseman Colton Burns placed himself on first with a single up the middle, and Bush, junior first baseman as well as the Gauchos slugging percentage leader, recorded his tenth homer of the season and put Santa Barbara backup 5-3 in the top of the third.</p>\n<p>To make the game even more interesting and competitive, Riverside’s bats did not stay quiet either in their offensive half of the inning as they brought in three runs off of three hits to lead UCSB 6-5.</p>\n<p>Nelson walked Shultz and advanced him to second on a pitch that hit Sawyer. After putting runners on first and second, Nelson then allowed three RBI singles from UCR third baseman Michael Farris, first baseman Cade Peters, and designated hitter Cannon. Nelson was subsequently pulled from the mound at this point and replaced by RHP Kevin Chandler (0-1, 4.95 ERA), who struck out the final two batters to end the third inning.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fifth, the Highlanders put up one more with a sac-fly from Peters that brought in senior center fielder Mark Contreras to make it 7-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense created only two hits and zero runs after their third inning at-bats, but they finally grew tired of their silence at the plate as they roared back with a late offensive surge to the top of the eighth. UCSB had four hits: a single to right from Bush, a single up the middle from sophomore DH Sam Cohen, a RBI single from Jew, and another RBI single from Muno. These scored two more for the ‘Chos to tie it again at 7-7.</p>\n<p>Ledesma, who replaced Chandler in the bottom of the seventh with two outs, fanned Cannon and Hardy and retired Sporrer with a fly-out to left in the bottom of the eighth to keep the score 7-7. He struggled a bit more in the bottom of ninth, giving up two walks but leaving those two Highlanders on base with two more strikeouts and another fly-out. In the tenth, he gave up two hits but still kept UCR from reaching home plate. And in the bottom of the eleventh, the allowance of a hit, two more walks, and a devastating error led to a walk-off win for the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>He struggled a bit more in the bottom of ninth, giving up two walks but leaving those two Highlanders on base with two more strikeouts and another fly-out.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara has won six of its last ten, but its last four wins have been a bit too close for comfort, with only a one to three run difference in the final score.</p>\n<p>But to their advantage, they trump Riverside in just about every offensive statistical category, leading UCR overall as a team in runs, hits, home runs, RBIs, walks, and stolen bases with a collective .277 batting average over the Highlanders .249 team average.</p>\n<p>Individually, UCSB junior Austin Bush is tied for first in Big West home runs at nine so far with CSUN junior Albee Weiss and is sitting at second, following Weiss, in conference RBIs with 32. Bush is one of the Gauchos biggest power hitters as the team leader in RBIs and home runs, along with sophomore Sam Cohen who is slugging .529 just above Bush’s .517 percentage.</p>\n<p>From Riverside, freshman Connor Cannon is behind Bush and Weiss in Big West homers with seven, putting the pitcher and first baseman for the Highlanders at second in a three-way tie with UC Irvine junior Keston Hiura and CSUN redshirt junior Kevin Riley. Other than Cannon, who also leads his team in RBIs, there is no one else from UCR is leading individually in conference hitting stats.</p>\n<p>Another Highlander for the Gauchos pitching staff and defense to tread lightly with at the dish is Mark Contreras, who is leading his team with a batting average of .402 and a mighty slugging percentage of .598.</p>\n<p>Regarding defense on the diamond, UC Riverside has been just slightly tighter and cleaner than UCSB this year with a .967 fielding percentage and eight fewer errors than the Gauchos line of defense, which has produced a .962 fielding percentage.</p>\n<p>On the mound, though, UCSB comes out on top with a combined 4.72 ERA to the Highlanders 5.50 ERA, also having allowed 25 less total earned runs, 39 fewer walks, and 14 more strikeouts than the UCR pitching staff.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams challenged each other was at the end of the 2016 season, in which the Highlanders grabbed the three-game series from the Gauchos with two wins at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p>Based on the subpar offensive and pitching statistics on behalf of UCR in comparison to those of UCSB, this could be an opportunity for the Gauchos to take advantage of their opponent’s larger weaknesses at the plate and on the hill to improve both their conference and overall records back to the .500 mark, or above, if they can execute two victories this weekend.</p>\n<p>However, as a disclaimer, previous statistical analysis cannot predict anything that will happen within nine innings of baseball.</p>\n<p>So although this is a team performing below average thus far, it does not mean that the Highlanders cannot defy expectations and start performing anomalous to their recent battles to keep it interesting.</p>\n<p>If there is anything a baseball player, coach, or fan can expect, it would be to not have any expectations. We can paint a pretty picture based on statistics and think about who should win, but it’s rarely the case that those statistics consistently and accurately translate what can happen, who could be the catalyst or the hero, or which team will end up taking the win.</p>\n<p>The series kicks off at 6 p.m. on Friday at Riverside Sports Complex, with another 6 p.m. evening game on Saturday, and an afternoon Sunday game at 1 p.m. to round out the series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

All that and the draft doesn’t even really improve parity of a league that has seen many of the same teams make the playoffs year in and year out.</p>\n<p>Under the rules of the NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement, rookies are the best deals in the league. That’s because their contracts are constrained by the rookie wage scale, which keeps their first-year salaries artificially low so teams could get a great investment.</p>\n<p>Per the terms of the CBA, each team has a rookie pool it can spend on its draft picks, with the size of the pool descending as the picks get lower. Spotrac estimates that the Browns will only be able to offer the first overall pick a contract worth a total of $30 million over four years.</p>\n<p>That’s a whole lot less compared to former first overall pick Sam Bradford’s $76 million contract given to him by the then St. Louis Rams after drafting him in 2010, which is, understandably, upsetting to this year’s pick (Myles Garrett, if the Browns are smart) since he would earn probably double without the rookie wage scale.</p>\n<p>In fact, the rookie wage scale only exists because teams went overboard with their rookie deals prior to its implementation, such as in the case of Bradford, who only spent four years in St. Louis throwing for only 11,065 yards, 59 touchdowns and 38 interceptions for a very average 80.1 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>This wage scale makes it so that rookies are the most cost-effective commodities in the NFL. Oakland Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack, for instance, who won the Defensive Player of the Year award last season, is still on his rookie deal, a four-year contract worth $18 million, per Spotrac. Von Miller, the player Mack beat out for DPOY last season, currently has a six-year $114.5 million contract. In 2017, Mack provided the Raiders with Von Miller-level production for just 15 percent of the price.</p>\n<p>No wonder teams like the Browns choose to tank. Only through the draft can teams find elite talent that costs as much as a middling veteran.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the draft system, NFL teams have a strong incentive to tank in order to secure a high pick. In my mind, any system that encourages losing is a broken system that requires major reformation.</p>\n<p>That reformation doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, it’s as easy as simply making incoming players free agents and creating a set rookie-free agency period.</p>\n<p>This change would wipe out any incentive to lose and would allow all teams to compete to sign the best rookie talents. There would be no rookie wage scale to artificially depress the wages of players like Khalil Mack and players would at last have the ability to choose where they want to start their careers.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the new rookie system would work like college recruiting. Teams, starting with the opening of the rookie-signing period, would work to court the top rookies of each class with fat contracts and promises of playing time, and each player would be able to choose from a variety of suitors.</p>\n<p>The existing salary cap would still be in place to act as a restriction on any one team’s ambitions during the rookie free-agency period.<br>\nSure, the Cowboys might be able to attract more rookie interest than other teams, but they’d only be able to sign as many top rookies as they could fit under the salary cap.</p>\n<p>Bad teams like the Browns would still have somewhat of an advantage in the new order, given their large amounts of cap space. All that space would come in handy when competing for the top rookies. Myles Garrett might love Texas, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to turn down additional tens of millions of dollars the Browns or 49ers can offer him.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the new rookie system would prioritize and reward smart teams.</p>\n<p>There are undervalued gems like Julian Edelman and Antonio Brown in every draft, players who in the new system would be available for cheap. While the Cowboys might go around pulling in one or two big names with big deals, other teams could snap up lots of these low-cost, high-value players. It’s what the Patriots and Steelers have been doing for years.</p>\n<p>Shifting from a draft to a rookie free-agency period would be a massive, but necessary, shift. It’s high time that the NFL and the NFLPA give rookies some actual power upon entering the league.</p>\n<p>Abolishing the draft would do that while simultaneously eliminating losing incentives in the NFL. That’s a win-win, and it won’t come at the cost of the NFL’s treasured parity.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

the junior college level. But even during that impressive season, he says, he could tell something was wrong.</p>\n<p>“I woke up one day last May and had this lump in my neck,” Bible said. “The doctor said it was normal for kids my age to get inflammation there sometimes, so because of that and the way I was playing, I just never thought anything of it.”</p>\n<p>However, more lumps would appear throughout the summer as he geared up to transfer from College of the Canyons to SDSU for the fall semester. Bible even admits that his girlfriend grew annoyed with him during the summer because all he wanted to do was sleep after games.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad, Mike, also stated that he always had concerns, adding, “It just never felt right to me from the beginning, and it wasn’t until the third or fourth check-up where they said, ‘I think it’s a waste of your time to get another scan’ that I started to believe it was nothing to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, Bible told a trainer at SDSU, who referred him to the team doctor. Other tests were done, leading to the biopsy in December of 2016.</p>\n<p>Then came the news that he had cancer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77364\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77364\" data-attachment-id=\"77364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"San Diego State Athlete Headshots\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77364\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug-683x1024.jpg?resize=280%2C420\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>“I didn’t really hear anything after the doctor said ‘cancer,’” Bible said. “But after they went into detail that I would have to drop out of school, quit playing baseball and move home for treatment, all I asked was that we started treatment the day after playing Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>After getting the reluctant “okay” from the doctor, Bible said, “That was so huge for me to be able to do that and to not see all this work I’ve put in over the years go to waste.”</p>\n<p>Getting a chance to play Fullerton was another contest circled on Bible’s calendar from a long time ago because it was the university that he attended out of high school. He redshirted his freshman year there, then transferred to College of the Canyons, before finally landing himself at SDSU.</p>\n<p>When looking back on it, Bible uses humor to downplay the situation.</p>\n<p>“I got along great with those guys at Fullerton, and I’ve never been a cancer in the clubhouse,” he joked. “But for whatever reason, the coach and I there just never saw eye to eye.”</p>\n<p>Through the first five games of the season, Bible batted clean-up for the Aztecs, eager to prove to himself and his former Fullerton coach that he could play at the Division 1 level.</p>\n<p>On February 22, 2017, Bible went 2-for-4 in a Wednesday night matchup versus the Fullerton Titans, which would improve and conclude his batting average at .318 for the season, as he would begin treatment the next morning.</p>\n<p>With each ensuing inning, things grew more emotional at Fullerton, though few in attendance knew it. Each time Bible stepped up to the plate, his family could be seen taking pictures of each at-bat behind the SDSU dugout, wiping away tears in the process.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs went on to earn a 5-4 victory that night following a save by SDSU closer CJ Saylor, who gave the game ball to Bible.</p>\n<p>Knowing he would be making his way to start his first round of chemotherapy at the City of Hope in Los Angeles just five hours later, Bible received a hug from each of the Fullerton players in line for handshakes. Some he knew and many he did not, but all were deeply moved by his story.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad recalls the moment as the most emotional one of his life.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t about the logo on your hat or the colors on your uniform that night,” he said. “It was just a bunch of dudes showing love and respect for something bigger than baseball.”</p>\n<p>Bible stated that the prognosis for him is great, adding that the survival rate is 90 to 95 percent. He has already gone through three rounds of treatment with five more scheduled every other week through the month of June.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77365\" style=\"width: 446px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77365\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77365\" data-attachment-id=\"77365\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bible500\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77365\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500-1024x683.jpg?resize=436%2C290\" alt=\"\" width=\"436\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>He says that he has developed hope from athletes who have walked in his shoes before, such as current Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and pitcher Jon Lester. Both players were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma during their careers and made full recoveries after their treatment. In fact, Lester was so moved by Bible’s story that he reached out via text during his treatment.</p>\n<p>“I just want to be an inspiration like those guys,” Bible said. “I mean, people can feel bad, and that’s all fine and dandy.

The standout redshirt senior defender Christina Kotsia scored a hat trick, while junior utility Virginia Smith netted two goals in the 8-7 nail-biter.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we have to do anything differently,” Kay said. “We went to six overtimes with them so it was anybody’s game, so our game plan doesn’t change.”</p>\n<p>Last weekend Long Beach came up short against Big West regular season champion UC Irvine in an attempt to establish itself as one of the conference best.</p>\n<p>The 49ers only mustered three goals, all from the second half, but held the Anteaters, who finished undefeated in conference play (5-0), to just six goals in the defeat.</p>\n<p>UCSB is 2-2 against LBSU all-time in the conference tournament, most recently in 2015, when Santa Barbara defeated Long Beach in overtime in a game for fifth place.</p>\n<p>The last four meetings between these two sides have all been decided by just one goal.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos can get their revenge on the 49ers, they will matchup against the No. 2 seed Hawaii Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>UCSB took down Hawaii in last year’s tournament final 11-5, a loss that is certainly still in the heads of the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>If UCSB loses to Long Beach State, it will play the loser of UC Davis versus Cal State Northridge in the fifth-place game on Saturday.</p>\n<p>With a four-game losing streak, their longest since February 2016, the Gauchos are ready to give it their all this weekend in their title defense.</p>\n<p>As for the mindset of the team, the reigning Big West Coach of the Year kept it simple: “Finish strong.”</p>\n<p>The last two Big West Tournament champions have been the hosts of the event, Hawaii in 2015 and UCSB last year.</p>\n<p>All the highs and lows of this campaign come down to this one tournament that will define the season for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Long Beach State on Friday, April 29, at 2 p.m. at the Schaal Aquatic Center at UC Davis.</p><div

It also earned its fourth regular season title with Head Coach Marty Davis at the helm.</p>\n<p>Dating back to April 11, 2015, UCSB has extended its win streak against Big West opponents to 11 straight victories in the regular season.  Including the past two conference tournaments, Santa Barbara holds a 16-match win streak against its Big West counterparts.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has been in outstanding form as of late; its last meet loss was way back on March 13 against No. 4 Texas Christian University.</p>\n<p>After their victory over the current No. 50 Cal Poly, the Gauchos are currently No. 40 in the nation according to Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings.</p>\n<p>The duo sensation of Gaucho junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays maintains a No. 30 doubles ranking as well, moving down one spot from No. 29.</p>\n<p>“This match [against Cal Poly] was actually bigger than the western conference regular season title,” Davis said. “We think it’s going to leave us far enough in the rankings where our RPI should get us into that large [NCAA selection] bid, regardless of the result at Indian Wells.”</p>\n<p>Coach Davis is referring to a spot for the Gauchos in the NCAA 2017 Division I men’s tennis tournament. That, of course, won’t occur until after the Big West Tournament and is set for some time around the middle of May.</p>\n<p>There’s much to know as UCSB enters the Big West Tournament in fine form, as well as with many historical accolades.</p>\n<p>The men’s tennis team will be competing for its third consecutive conference title. The Gauchos have previously won the Big West Tournament championships a total of 10 times program history.</p>\n<p>They have won 7 of the last 11 tournaments at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, which will once again be this year’s competition venue.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West championship concluded with a No. 1 and No. 2 seed finals matchup that had Santa Barbara face off against rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The meet resulted in a 4-1 score and featured the familiar competitors of sophomore doubles pair Nicolas Moreno de Alboran/Anders Holm, junior Cody Rakela, senior Morgan Mays and senior Teague Hamilton, as well as Cal Poly’s No. 61 duo of seniors Corey Pang and Ben Donovan.</p>\n<p>Previewing Friday’s potential competitors, UCSB will meet against the winner of Wednesday’s No. 4- versus No. 5-seeded match of UC Irvine and the University of Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s dominance of both programs has been well established over the years.</p>\n<p>It last lost to UC Irvine during the 2014-15 season and fell to Hawaii during its 2012-13 campaign. Due to rain, the matchup between UCSB and Hawaii was canceled during the 2013-14 season.</p>\n<p>Irvine ended its season with a 5-2 loss to No. 2-seed UC Davis and concluded its 2017 regular season at 8-14. The Anteaters also managed a fourth-place conference ranking following a 2-4 finish.</p>\n<p>UCSB previously defeated UC Irvine 5-2 on April 15 while on the road.</p>\n<p>As for Hawaii, the Gauchos opened up their season with an away doubleheader against the Rainbow Warriors, which resulted in a 7-0 sweep. They ended the season last in the Big West Conference standings at 1-4 and also finished their regular season with a meager 2-14 overall record.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against the winner of the No. 4/5 seed match, either UC Irvine or the University of Hawaii, this Friday, April 28 at 3 p.m. at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/","id":1200,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1199,1198,1197],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Thriving Off Current 7-Match Win Streak, Hold No. 2 Seed in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The road to repeat as Big West conference champs begin this week for UCSB who holds the No. 2 seed headed into the tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team is preparing to go on the road to compete in the Big West Tournament at Indian Wells, where it will look to defend last season’s conference title.

In addition to benefitting from having five returners from the 2015-16 team, Santa Barbara is a more enticing team to keep an eye on entering the tournament, as it carries a seven-match winning streak into the postseason.</p>\n<p>However, for Cal Poly, the outlook coming into the tournament has been a bit less optimistic. The team barely missed out on having to play this Thursday in the first round in which the No. 8 and 9 seeds face off. Yet, even if the Mustangs had won, they would have been forced to face the unbeaten No. 1 Hawaii Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Mustangs get a second look at the Gauchos in the quarterfinals and hope to perform better the second time around.</p>\n<p>In order to perform better against UCSB, Cal Poly has to make an effort to get ahead early, be it in doubles play or in the first matches of singles play. The Gauchos were simply able to dominate the Mustangs, carrying the momentum from winning the doubles point in singles play during which only one Mustang, junior Molly Reed, picked up a victory in singles play.</p>\n<p>Stopping the Gauchos before they are able to get on a run looks to be the only way Cal Poly will be able to come out on top or at least thoroughly challenge UCSB.</p>\n<p>Should Santa Barbara get past the Mustangs, waiting in the second round could potentially be either No. 3 Long Beach State or No. 6 UC Davis. A good sign for the Gauchos in these potential matchups is that the team defeated both teams during the regular season. The Aggies also suffered a loss in the quarterfinals of last year’s tournament to UCSB, 4-0.</p>\n<p>A potential matchup against the Beach in this year’s tournament could be one of the most exciting.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State possesses a long and storied history in the Big West Championships, having been crowned champions an impressive 12 times since 2002.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team’s first match in the Big West Conference Championships is against the Cal Poly Mustangs on Friday, April 28, at 9 a.m. The championships run until Sunday, April 30, on which the championship match will be played at 9 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 20, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/","id":1197,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1196,1195,1194],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Gears Up for Summer Basketball Camps","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ucsb-mens-bball-camps.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ucsb-mens-bball-camps.jpg?resize=692%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Hoping to reestablish a winning culture both ona dn off the court, the UCSB men's basketball program revealed the significance of putting on events such as its upcoming summer camps.

We want to bridge that gap,” Miller explained. “They’re all here and training, [which] is perfect because we’re less than 10 minutes away from P3. It’ll be good to be able to get NBA players to [UCSB], especially if they have time to come speak to the campers.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has even become home to the likes of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan as the hosting location to each of their youth basketball camps.</p>\n<p>With plans to reinvent the culture of UCSB men’s basketball, the team’s staff is committed to taking the program beyond the court by establishing a universal influence amongst its supporters.</p>\n<p>“We want everyone here to see what Coach Pasternack is about,” Miller said. “He’s a big guy with the kids; his own son is going to be here, so he’ll be a camper, too. He really wants to show the community that it’s not just about winning games; there’s a bigger picture. If we can get the whole community involved, that’s great. That’s what we want to do, especially with these camps so [people] can get to know him and our staff.”</p>\n<p>Determined to utilize its resourceful platform at hand, the UCSB men’s basketball coaching staff is focused on reinventing Gaucho basketball with one primary influence: a love for the game.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/","id":528,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[527,526,525],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Bests CSUB 6-4 in Midweek Home Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball_vsTulane-170226-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball_vsTulane-170226-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team improved their record to 18-20 Tuesday afternoon once it completed comeback 6-4 win against Cal State Bakersfield.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_76017\" style=\"width: 609px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/jj-muno-looks-at-the-runner-and-is-ready-to-throw-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-76017\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76017\" data-attachment-id=\"76017\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/jj-muno-looks-at-the-runner-and-is-ready-to-throw-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball_vsTulane-170226-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"JJ Muno looks at the runner and is ready to throw.

The Roadrunners, now owners of a 20-16 overall record, got ahead with an early start, but the Gauchos would answer back and hold their lead due to a much-needed stellar performance from their bullpen.</p>\n<p>On the mound for UCSB was big lefty Ben Brecht. After going seven Innings pitched in his last start against Pepperdine, Brecht would only go four innings against the Roadrunners giving up six hits and four earned runs altogether for a no decision in the contest.</p>\n<p>The true freshman was shaken up early on in the first inning after giving up a leadoff double and two more base hits, which would lead to two runs off the young lefty.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brecht, who had decent stuff in his outing, would come out for a much needed 1-2-3 frame before giving up one more run off a sacrifice fly from the second baseman David Metzgar in the third frame. In the fourth, senior shortstop Ryan Grotjohn would lead off the inning with a hustle double on a bloop to left field. Despite this, Brecht held the Roadrunners to one run, making the score 4-0 after the top half of the frame.</p>\n<p>Even though this was not the start the Gauchos wanted from their young pitcher, the bats would pick up Brecht their young pitcher. In the bottom of the fourth, the Gauchos would finally get to Bakersfield own freshman pitcher Mathew Seibert.</p>\n<p>With one out in the inning, the sixth hole hitter senior outfielder Billy Fredrick would get things going with a perfectly back-spun base-hit line drive to centerfield. Next, freshman outfielder Armani Smith would single up the middle right after Fredrick to knock out the right-handed Seibert. The reliever turned starter for the day would have a predictable short outing going only 3.1 IP with no strikeouts and giving up two earned runs.</p>\n<p>However, even his relief pitcher, freshman Kenny Johnson could not stop UCSB from its big inning. JJ Muno would find barrel, singling through the left side. With back to back to back hits, the Gauchos had the bases loaded with only one out.</p>\n<p>Eric Yang, the freshman catcher had the table set for his first collegiate hit to be a big one. Yang, although not getting a hit, would still get the job done hitting a high chopper to third not allowing a double play or a throw home to get the force out. The freshman catcher would get thrown out at first but a run would score.</p>\n<p>The most clutch at bat of the day though would come next in the form of Colton Burns. The junior second baseman would come through with a two out double roped into the left center gap scoring both Smith and Muno making the score 4-3 through four complete.</p>\n<p>In relief for Brecht, the true freshman righty Chris Lincoln would come in with some swagger to sit down Roadrunner batters. The pitcher who models his game after the late Yodano Ventura, came in and let it be known to the Gaucho coaching staff that they can have some faith in their youthful bullpen after a couple shaky outings.</p>\n<p>Lincoln had his A+ stuff, wooing the crowd with his electric fastball and Wiffle ball-esque slider. The lengthy righty with an impressive pitcher’s build would go 3.1 IP giving up only two hits with as many strikeouts. Moving forward, especially after this outing, Lincoln could be a potential starter in future years for the Chos.</p>\n<p>To back up a dominant bullpen performance from Lincoln, the Gauchos would continue to score runs as the game went on.  During the sixth, reliever Malik Jones who oddly enough DH’d for Bakersfield in the game as well, balked in a run, scoring Armani Smith.</p>\n<p>In the seventh though Austin “Big Daddy” Bush would make people understand why his nickname is “Big Daddy.”  The Gaucho four hitter would hit a ball, not only over the first fence in right field, but over a second set of fences protecting transformers as well for a solo homerun. To simply put it, Bush didn’t just get a piece of it; he got the whole thing and disgraced the Ball’s entire family with one swing. The statement making go ahead home run from Bush would completely deflate the CSUB dugout and put all the air into the sails of UCSB.</p>\n<p>JJ Muno would score the last run of the game for the Chos, giving a huge insurance run for UCSB. After a walk, Muno would wreak havoc on the base paths. With the offensive mindset of run-until-they-tag-ya, Muno would steal second and then steal third.  While stealing third the throw from Bakersfield catcher Jake Oliver would short hop third baseman Brandon Heinrich and shoot into left field. Muno would score easy and manufacture a run in the most Pete Rose way possible.</p>\n<p>With a two run lead, Shea Barry would come in to close it out for the Chos and had little trouble. Barry would continue to show why he is the most accountable pitcher to call on out of the pin by ending the game with a big strike out with a runner scoring position.  The righty would collect his third save of the year and lower his team leading ERA to 2.53. The final score: 6 to 4 UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 14-9 at home this season. With a quality comeback win against a solid Bakersfield squad.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have some momentum heading to UC Riverside for a three game weekend conference series starting Friday night at 6 p.m. Both Friday’s and Saturday’s matchups will be aired and available on ESPN 3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/","id":4128,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

With a remarkable total of 31 sacks and 47 tackles for loss in his three-year career as an Aggie, scouts are raving about this future rookie with all-pro potential. Just to add more fuel to the fire, Garrett, at 6’5” and 271 lbs, ran a 4.62 time in the 40-yard dash at his pro day. At this point, it’d be foolish for the Browns to pass up on such a franchise talent.       </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 2 San Francisco 49ers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With player comparisons to Brandon Graham, or even “a smaller J.J. Watt,” Solomon Thomas caught many scouts’ eyes during his two-year stint at Stanford. Following an impressive combine performance, we saw Thomas’s draft stock rise and rise. Now with, new 49ers general manager John Lynch at the helm, he’ll make sure to play it safe with his inaugural first-round pick and pick the next-best player after Garrett.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 3 Chicago Bears:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Allen, DE, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winner of the 2016 Bronco Nagurski Trophy for best college defensive player in the nation, Jonathan Allen had quite the outstanding campaign during his four years at Alabama. With 152 total tackles and 28 sacks, Allen has the stats and durability to prove that he’s NFL-ready. The Bears could look to bolster either their defensive line or secondary here. One thing is for sure, Chicago’s defense could really use a first-round game changer.    </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 4 Jacksonville Jaguars:</b></p>\n<p><b>Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before starting with Leonard Fournette, we urge you to please look up some of his highlights. At 6’1” and 228 lbs, he possesses the ability to escape the line of scrimmage and the strength to break the tackle. Fournette’s play style has been appropriately compared to that of Ezekiel Elliott’s, and he is arguably the best offensive player in the entire draft. This LSU halfback has what it takes to be a week-one starter in Jacksonville and may very well be the spark needed to get the Jaguars’ offense going.         </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 5 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 2016 college football season, Ohio State’s Marshon Lattimore allowed an average NFL passer rating of 30.2 whenever he covered the throw. Do you know what the NFL passer rating is for spiking the ball into the ground on every play? It’s 39.6. Yeah, you don’t need to be a statistician to realize that’s ridiculous. This year, Lattimore is heralded as the best cornerback coming out of college, so the Titans would be wise to choose him over a wide receiver because he definitely won’t be present for their 18th overall pick.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 6 New York Jets:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jamal Adams, S, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been multiple reports recently that a Jamal Adams as a first overall talent. However, analysts agree that the Browns probably won’t trade out of the first pick and will most likely let Adams fall to another team. Regardless, with 209 total tackles and five interceptions throughout his college career, the Jets find their missing link with this pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 7 Los Angeles Chargers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers have built a sneaky good secondary over the past few seasons. So after a stellar combine performance by Malik Hooker, it very well seems he is San Diego-bound. With seven interceptions in only two seasons at Ohio State, Hooker has arguably the best hands in the draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 8 Carolina Panthers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fournette off the board, the Panthers have a choice to make at running back. The very versatile Christian McCaffrey is an interesting option as well, but Carolina will ultimately settle for a halfback that can get it done on every down. At 4,464 yards and 46 touchdowns over three seasons for Florida State, Dalvin Cook will relieve some pressure off his quarterback and former league MVP, Cam Newton.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 9 Cincinnati Bengals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bengals really hit the jackpot with both A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert highlighting their receiving corps. Unfortunately, they both face injury issues from time to time, and this is most likely due to excessive targets are thrown their way. Corey Davis has the speed and build to be a quality NFL wide receiver, so the Bengals use their No. 9 spot to form an elite trio that defenses around the league must respect.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 10 Buffalo Bills:</b></p>\n<p><b>Mike Williams, WR, Clemson </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sammy Watkins can’t get it done all by himself, so the Bills get quarterback Tyrod Taylor another target in Mike Williams. With 2,727 yards and 21 touchdowns over his four-year career at Clemson, Williams is the best receiver in this draft for many analysts. Considering his 98 receptions in just his senior year alone, it’s proven he can handle the workload of a No. 1 receiver as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 11 New Orleans Saints:</b></p>\n<p><b>Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In only three seasons at Tennessee, Derek Barnett racked up 32 sacks and 52 tackles for loss. These are numbers that rival Myles Garrett and other top defensive lineman in this draft, so why is he projected lower than the rest? Well, after an average performance at the NFL combine, Barnett’s draft stock began to slowly fall. Nevertheless, the stats are there and the Saints will capitalize on other teams’ dismissal of Barnett’s talent. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 12 Cleveland Browns:</b></p>\n<p><b>O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Browns will close out their first-round picks with yet another player that is starter ready. O.J. Howard, the four-year tight end out of Alabama, will provide Cleveland with a 6’6” and 242 lbs target that can get it done down the middle or in the red zone. This spot may even see a quarterback selection, but with Terrelle Pryor Sr. out of the mix, another good set of hands may be the more rational option. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 13 Arizona Cardinals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a while now, the Cardinals have been looking for a lockdown corner that can play opposite of Patrick Peterson. Well, luckily for them, reports agree that this year’s draft talent is very deep at the cornerback position. Marlon Humphrey was the star corner at Alabama, so with five interceptions and 81 total tackles in just his two-year college career, this pick makes sense for Arizona.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 14 Philadelphia Eagles:</b></p>\n<p><b>Tre’Davious White, CB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eagles were busy during this offseason free agency with the signings of Alshon Jeffery to the receiving corps and Chris Long to the defensive line. So their remaining draft priorities are for a corner or running back. This can very much be where McCaffrey is selected, but the Eagles ultimately fill the most pressing need and take the 167 total tackles and six interceptions: Tre’Davious White.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 15 Indianapolis Colts:</b></p>\n<p><b>Reuben Foster, LB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s another draft prospect with some astonishing game film. We recommend you look up some Reuben Foster highlights because he could very well be one of the hardest hitting linebackers coming out of college since the turn of the century. With 211 total tackles and seven sacks over three seasons at Alabama, Foster would be a steal for the Colts, if he even falls this far. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 16 Baltimore Ravens:</b></p>\n<p><b>Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ravens will be building through the draft in order to re-establish a frightening defense that has twice earned them a Super Bowl title. With a couple of free agency losses to the defensive line, the Ravens select a quality defensive end in Taco Charlton. Charlton put up 28 tackles for loss and 19 sacks in his four years for Michigan. He also has the best first name in this entire draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 17 Washington Redskins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jabrill Peppers, LB, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve seen mock drafts that have Jabrill Peppers going as early as the top 10 and as late as the second round. So No. 17 overall seems like a fair spot to place the former Heisman nominee. Peppers is an all-around athletic machine, with great stats in both offensive and defensive positions. The Redskins need a playmaker that’ll make his presence known throughout the game, so they pick up this prolific Michigan linebacker.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 18 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>John Ross, WR, Washington </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Ross caught many scouts’ eyes at the combine when he set the 40-yard dash record with a 4.22 time, but it’ll also be his route running skills that’ll make him go in the first round of the NFL draft. In his junior year alone, Ross caught 81 receptions for 1,150 yards and 17 touchdowns. With Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota throwing to him, this wide receiver out of Washington will likely be burning defensive backs all season long.     </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 19 Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Buccaneers are currently rethinking their future with Doug Martin as their lead back. So they’ll look to the draft in order to find a replacement for the pro bowler. Enter Christian McCaffrey, the record-breaking running back out of Stanford. In only three years, McCaffrey rushed for 3,922 yards on 632 attempts. He also caught plenty out of the backfield with 99 receptions for 1,206 yards, bringing his total count to 31 touchdowns. With pick 19, Tampa Bay finds a potential franchise halfback.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 20 Denver Broncos:</b></p>\n<p><b>Garett Bolles, OT, Utah</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a bit of a quarterback conundrum going on in Denver at the moment. Whether it’s Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch lining up under center, they’ll need to beef up their offensive line in this year’s draft. With the Bronco’s first round pick, they select, the 6’5” and 300-pound offensive tackle, Garett Bolles out of Utah. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 21 Detroit Lions:</b></p>\n<p><b>Charles Harris, DE, Missouri </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this pick, the Lions pretty much just go for the best available player still on the board. With 34.5 tackles for loss and 18 sacks in his three seasons at Missouri, Charles Harris’s size and athleticism will easily translate into continued success within the NFL. He’ll also greatly complement Ezekiel Ansah and Haloti Ngata on the Detroit defensive line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 22 Miami Dolphins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Forrest Lamp, OG, Western Kentucky</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could argue that quarterback Ryan Tannehill isn’t at the franchise level, but with quality starting quarterbacks currently a scarcity in the league, the Dolphins decide to add more depth to the pass protection position. Forrest Lamp, after a great combine showing and consistent college numbers, is arguably the best offensive prospect in this year’s draft.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 23 New York Giants:</b></p>\n<p><b>Ryan Ramczyk, OT, Wisconsin </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quarterback has also been projected for this pick, but the Giants ultimately decide to choose a tackle that can protect their star quarterback Eli Manning. At 6’6” and 314 lbs, Ryan Ramczyk will not only protect from the pass rush but also help with the outside running game in New York.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 24 Oakland Raiders:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik McDowell, DL, Michigan State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McDowell’s draft stock rose after his combine day impressed various scouts. Now the Raiders are projected to select this three-year Michigan State Spartan that recorded 24.5 tackles for loss with 88 total tackles.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 25 Houston Texans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, we have the first quarterback in the entire draft go at No. 25. Deshaun Watson, out of Clemson, is arguably the most prepared when it comes to being in control and winning games for his team. In 38 games for Clemson, he put up over 10,000 passing yards for a total of 90 touchdowns. The Texans Band-Aid their Brock Osweiler mistake and get potentially a franchise quarterback in Watson with their first-round pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 26 Seattle Seahawks:</b></p>\n<p><b>Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been plenty of rumors recently that the Seahawks will lose star cornerback Richard Sherman via trade, causing Seattle to draft defensive back Kevin King in the first. However, we believe Sherman will be in a Seahawks uniform next year and that Cam Robinson will be plugged right into Seattle’s o-line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 27 Kansas City Chiefs:</b></p>\n<p><b>Zach Cunningham, LB, Vanderbilt</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kansas City’s defense has been a force to be reckoned with in past seasons, so they’ll add to the hype with this pick. Following Reuben Foster, Zach Cunningham is in the conversation for the next best at the linebacker position. This playmaker out of Vanderbilt is a tackling machine, with 256 total tackles in just three seasons of his college career. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 28 Dallas Cowboys:</b></p>\n<p><b>Takkarist McKinley, LB, UCLA </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cowboys have gotten a lot of criticism recently concerning their defensive play, and after losing a few starters to free agency, there’ll be some spots to fill. Cornerbacks, like Sidney Jones or Teez Tabor, who slipped out of the early first round are projected here. However, the Cowboys go ahead and choose UCLA linebacker Takkarist McKinley for his big frame and great athleticism. </span><br>\n<b>No. 29 Green Bay Packers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Gareon Conley, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a roulette of starters and a couple of injuries at cornerback, Green Bay decides to go with a Buckeye and select Gareon Conley as their first-rounder. Conley had 91 tackles and six interceptions in his three seasons at Ohio State. Alongside Lattimore and Hooker, Conley helped form perhaps the best defensive back trio in college football last season. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 30 Pittsburgh Steelers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Obi Melifonwu, S, Connecticut </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obi Melifonwu had arguably the best combine day out of anyone else in the draft. At 6’3” and 217 lbs, his draft stock skyrocketed after he put on a show in front of the scouts. In four seasons with Connecticut, Melifonwu made 349 total tackles and caught eight interceptions as a college safety.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 31 Atlanta Falcons:  </b></p>\n<p><b> T.J. Watt, LB, Wisconsin</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a disastrous Super Bowl, Atlanta is now aware of a few spots that need replacing throughout the defensive line. So they look to linebacker T.J. Watt out of Wisconsin to remedy this. In just a pair of seasons, Watt had 17 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks. This 6’5” linebacker definitely has the size to be in this league, but can he be as big as his brother J.J. Watt? The Falcons sure hope so.</span></p>\n<p><b><strong>No.32 </strong>New England Patriots:</b></p>\n<p><strong>Adoree’ Jackson, CB, University of Southern California </strong></p>\n<p>Seeking a defensive leader in their secondary, the Saints will close out the first round finding one in cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. Over his 3 seasons at USC, Jackson put up 139 total tackles and 6 interceptions.

The prolific junior attacker Madeleine Sanchez scored the penalty to cut the Gaucho lead to 5-3 heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara restored its three-goal lead in the third quarter after senior defender Sophie Trabucco ended a scoring drought of over 10 minutes for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>CSUN responded with back-to-back goals to make it a 6-5 game in the Gauchos favor.</p>\n<p>Senior utility Jenna Solberg scored UCSB’s seventh goal as the shot clock expired, but the Matadors got one back off a power play.</p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, the Matadors took their first lead of the game with two consecutive goals from Sanchez who had a brilliant six goal performance.</p>\n<p>At the 3:30 mark in the final stanza, Pipkin tallied her hat trick tying the game up at eight apiece.</p>\n<p>Northridge scored the winner with 2:47 remaining in the game, capturing its first conference victory since 2015 by the final score of 9-8.</p>\n<p>As the sixth seed in the upcoming Big West tournament, UCSB faces an uphill battle in its quest of defending its tournament title.</p>\n<p>The sixth seed has only finished in the top-4 once in Big West tournament history when the sixth ranked Long Beach State 49ers were runner-ups in 2011.</p>\n<p>The Big West tournament begins Friday, April 28, for UCSB when it faces Long Beach State in Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77269\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-end-season-winless-in-conf-play-for-the-first-time-in-program-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77269\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-end-season-winless-in-conf-play-for-the-first-time-in-program-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-end-season-winless-in-conf-play-for-the-first-time-in-program-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-end-season-winless-in-conf-play-for-the-first-time-in-program-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-end-season-winless-in-conf-play-for-the-first-time-in-program-history/","id":4900,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4899,4898,4897],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":51,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
