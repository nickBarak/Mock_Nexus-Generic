Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Coming off two big upset wins at home last week against then No. 6 LBSU and then No. 5 Stanford, the UCSB men’s water polo team jumped up two spots in the national rankings to be the new No. 5 team in the nation. The Gauchos will look to ride that momentum this week into Irvine for their third conference match of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara faces off against No. 18 UCI boasting a 13-6 overall record, 2-0 Golden Coast record — tied for the best record in conference play so far — and winner of five of its last six matches. In its 19 matches played this year, UCSB has only lost once to a team ranked lower than they are in a game against the No. 7 LBSU when the Gauchos were ranked sixth in the country.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters host their former MPSF rival, and now GCC rival, with an even 9-9 record and 1-1 record in Golden Coast play thus far. Their lone conference win came at San Jose State by a final tally of 10-9. Santa Barbara convincingly beat that same Spartan team 13-7 two weeks ago, albeit at home.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB and UCI met twice last season with both teams each nodding a win; however, UCI’s was a bit sweeter as it came in the MPSF conference tournament, helping them place sixth in the competition while Santa Barbara settled with a seventh-place finish.</p>\n<p>All time, the Anteaters dominate the series, going 102-45 in 147 total meetings, but in the two squads’ last 11 meetings, the Gauchos have been the more dominant team, winning eight of those matches.</p>\n<p>With that being said, UCSB is in too perfect of a position this far into the 2016 campaign, in both conference and nonconference, to blow it now against a UCI team that it should beat with its more talented roster.</p>\n<p>In their two big wins last week, it truly was a team effort for the Gauchos. The team totaled 15 goals in the two games with only two players scoring more than a single goal in each match. One of those players was utility Ivan Gvozdanovic.</p>\n<p>The emergence of the young freshman was more than apparent last week after notching two goals against Long Beach State and adding one more versus Stanford. In the last four matches, the Serbian native has dominated, scoring a total of 10 goals, including a hat-trick against No. 2 USC.</p>\n<p>Other key factors in the winning stride the Gauchos have found as of late are seniors Mitchell Hamilton, an attacker, and Reed Cotterill, a utility. Both Hamilton and Cotterill have scored at least one goal in six of their last seven games.</p>\n<p>However, the argument could be made that the most dominant UCSB athlete as of late on the water polo team has been senior goalkeeper Liam Lenihan. The senior’s play has been excellent as he limited both the 49ers and the Cardinals to their second-lowest-scoring totals of the season with five and six, respectively. In the two games last week, Lenihan allowed only 11 goals while racking up 25 total saves, including a season-high 15 against Stanford.</p>\n<p>With all this talent on the roster, it could be difficult for UC Irvine to keep up, but it intends to as long as key players Jack Trush and Ryan Warde show up for the entire length of the game. Trush, a senior defender, has tallied 34 goals on the season, best on the team, including a season-high five-score performance against Pomona-Pitzer earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Warde has also been solid on the offensive side, scoring 28 goals on the season, good enough for second best on the team. The junior attacker is coming off a great game at SJSU, tallying a season-high four goals in that match.</p>\n<p>However, the biggest problem for the Anteaters this 2016 campaign isn’t a lack of scoring, but it seems to be a lack of defense once the fourth quarter starts. Through three quarters this season, UCI has been outscored by a total of 10 goals; however, in the final frame alone, it has been outscored by the same total.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match should be an easy win for the Gauchos. Although it is a conference game and no matches should be taken lightly, the truth is that this UC Irvine team UCSB is facing tomorrow is not the one it is accustomed to facing.</p>\n<p>UCI has not been the same team as in the past, and Santa Barbara needs to take advantage of that in order to get a 3-0 GCC record, which will them in prime position to take the inaugural regular season conference title. Despite only being 2-4 on the road this season, the Gauchos need to find some way to get this victory and keep the momentum rolling as the regular season begins to come to a close.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UC Irvine at the Anteater Aquatics Complex on Friday, Oct. 28 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The defense did its part as well, holding the Mustangs to just two shots in the 110-minute match.</p>\n<p>Junior midfielder Kevin Feucht has owned the midfield all year for UCSB, leading the team with 10 goals — the highest in the Big West and tied for 12th in the nation. The German has been the driving force in the middle of the park for the Gauchos, popping up in all the right areas with an engine-like work-rate.</p>\n<p>The trio of DePuy, Feucht and Selemani has been stellar to say the least as each player ranks top-5 in the conference for goals.</p>\n<p>However, after forcing a draw at Harder Stadium the last time it met UCSB, Sac State will like their chances with the division leaders coming to town. The Hornets got their first point at UCSB since the Tim Vom Steeg era took over back in 1999, while also halting the Gauchos’ then three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>As things stand, the Hornets look likely to find their way into Big West playoffs, and could pull off a shocking division title with a win in their next two matches along with the help of two Santa Barbara losses this weekend.</p>\n<p>That being said, it’s a tall task considering how UCSB has tightened up in the back in recent weeks and has seemingly found the formula of fighting through tough games to get positive results.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have played five overtime matches in league thus far — posting a 2-0-3 record in those matches — and although the long games might take a bit of a physical toll, the side will be one of the most tested teams around come postseason play.</p>\n<p>Following their five-game losing streak, Vom Steeg’s men have yet to lose and, despite dropping out of the Coaches’ Poll after peaking as high as No. 4, have managed to climb their way back into the conversation, receiving a vote for the first time in nearly a month and a half.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, six players will be honored at Senior Night for the outgoing class’ final home game of the regular season. DePuy; senior midfielders Seo-In Kim, Josue España and Riley Peterson; and senior defenders Andy Perez and Josue Salgado will all be hoping to end their final season with a postseason run.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s match will be played against Sac State at 3 p.m. at Hornet Soccer Field.</p>\n<p>The senior day battle against UC Davis will take place on Sunday, Oct. 30, at Harder Stadium at 2 p.m. The game will be aired on BigWestTV.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The losing woes remained for the Matadors, who lost their sixth consecutive match to fall to 6-14 and 2-6.</p>\n<p>With the challenge of being in the middle of the pack within the Big West standings as the season nears its end, the Gauchos are facing dire circumstances as their postseason chances are on the line.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re trying to win out. We’re trying to get an opportunity to go in the postseason because I think we can really make a run,” said senior middle Elizabeth Sheffield. “We’ve had some pretty tough losses this season, but when we play the way we played tonight, we can do really well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to take the Big West leading Long Beach State 49ers to five sets, something that had happened just twice in conference play prior to Friday’s match. UCSB had not yet played a fifth set since beginning the conference schedule on Sept. 23.</p>\n<p>For the first time against a Big West opponent this season, Long Beach State found itself in a two-set hole early in the match.</p>\n<p>The match’s first set began with a furious back-and-forth; the score tied up 6 times before settling at only 10 apiece.</p>\n<p>After three straight errors for UCSB, first-year outside hitter Megan Rice notched three kills, junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman added a service ace and redshirt first-year outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins earned a kill of her own, taking what had been a three-point deficit and turning it into the first Gaucho lead since the set’s third point.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to successfully hold off the 49ers for the remainder of the set, though the pesky 49er squad would never trail by more than three until first-year defensive specialist Maxine Burke’s service ace gave the Gauchos a 25-21 win.</p>\n<p>Megan Rice and Lindsey Ruddins would again prove decisive characters in the second frame, with two kills each in UCSB’s first eight points of the set. First-year middle blocker Rowan Ennis would add a kill of her own, and two service aces early in the set from Lexi Rottman would aid an early 9-3 Gaucho lead.</p>\n<p>The 49ers would did their best to close the gap, but the Gauchos contained LBSU with an excellent offensive effort, out-hitting their opponent for the second consecutive set, this time .314 to .281.</p>\n<p>Sensing their backs against the wall, Long Beach came out firing in the third set, the most lopsided of the entire match and a decisive turning point in what had been UCSB’s night.</p>\n<p>UCSB was sloppy to say the least in the third, as they would produce their first eight-error set of the night, coincidentally <em>not </em>their last of the sort.</p>\n<p>Despite several errors early on, the Gauchos still fought to a 14-13 deficit, capped by a block from Rowan Ennis and Megan Rice.</p>\n<p>The train came off the tracks at that point, however, as a series of kills, including three from junior middle blocker Ashley Murray, and attack errors from UCSB would result in an 11-2 set-ending run for LBSU.</p>\n<p>The 49ers dominated the Gauchos in hitting percentage, racking up a .440 mark of their own while holding UCSB to a minuscule .000.</p>\n<p>After playing to an eight-point tie in the fourth, a five-point LBSU run would set the difference between the two teams for the majority of the set’s remainder. A late four-point run, including two kills from Lindsey Ruddins, would bring the Gauchos within three, but a kill from sophomore outside hitter Megan Kruidhof assisted by redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens sent the teams to a fifth set.</p>\n<p>The tie-breaker was the closest set of the match, with neither team ever gaining more than a two-point lead.</p>\n<p>Kills from Chanel Hoffman and Lindsey Ruddins, accompanied by an attack error from senior outside hitter Nele Barber, put the Gauchos ahead 12-11, a victory against the Big West leaders seemingly within reach.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s resilient offense flexed its muscles once again, though, as Kruidhof killed two attacks, first-year libero Hailey Harward added another, and Nele Barber finished the job with a kill to give the 49ers a 15-13 set win, remaining unblemished on the season.</p>\n<p>Barber was the star of the evening, dominating with 22 kills on a .442 percentage, only three errors and 12 digs. She now stands at second in the conference with 4.17 kills per set in Big West play, and fifth with 4.23 digs per set over the same span.</p>\n<p>Missy Owens was yet again everywhere setting up her teammates, as her 45 assists added to her 11.37 assists per set against Big West competition, a mark that ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was back in early season form for the Gauchos, and her 25 kills (.361 kill percentage) were a match high. Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt also continued to improve after returning from injury, scoring 12 kills on 26 attempts (.308 percentage).</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi continued to lead her team on the defensive end with 16 digs, second in the match to LBSU’s Hailey Harward.</p>\n<p>The match showed the 49ers’ ability to come through in tough spots, as they continued their season-long winning streak in five-set matches, maintaining their storybook year and improving to 15-7 overall and 9-0 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite Friday’s heartbreaker, UCSB came out with a strong performance in its following match against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>A strong first set saw the Gauchos build a 24-16 lead, and despite a flurry of UCSB errors that got CSUN to 20 points, Megan Rice was able to finish the deal with a kill to seal the game.</p>\n<p>The Matadors were much more collected in the second set, playing the Gauchos to a series of ties before grabbing a 20-19 lead late. Two kills from Lindsey Ruddins as well as one from senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield would put the Gauchos up, and despite a short back-and-forth, they would hold the lead to gain a 2-0 set advantage.</p>\n<p>CSUN won a close third set 25-23, with no team ever gaining a large margin over the other. After blowing a 2-0 set lead on Friday, however, the Gauchos were not going to let another match slip between their fingers.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was UCSB’s best, as they produced a kill percentage of .407 on their way to a 25-17 win. A 6-1 run to start the set would prove to be the defining stretch; the cushion would be sufficient to suppress each Matador burst.</p>\n<p>Outside hitters Julie Haake (senior) and Aeryn Owens (sophomore) held down the offensive end for CSUN, with 22 and 16 kills respectively. Owens ranks fourth in Big West play with 4.03 kills per set, while Haake had one of her more impressive matches of the year as she normally averages 2.94 kills per set (14th in the conference).</p>\n<p>Owens added 15 digs, second on the team to junior libero Katie Sato, who accumulated 19 of her own. Junior setter Lauren Conati led the match with 48 assists and contributed a solid eight digs as well.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Sheffield produced a career evening, with nine kills on 13 attempts for an über-efficient .615 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>“We needed more offense and Liz was outstanding coming in off the bench for us,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “She was pretty much unstoppable out of the middle.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley was the ultimate teammate, creating opportunities for her fellow Gauchos all over the court on her way to 47 assists. After 57 in the match against LBSU, she now sits at third in the Big West with 10.50 assists per set against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was again the offensive standout for UCSB, as her 19 kills led the team. She and Chanel Hoffman both rank in the top 10 for kills per set against the Big West, with 3.46 and 3.44 respectively.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have fairly consistently been able to beat teams around their record this season, while running into trouble against the more difficult competition.</p>\n<p>“It comes down to the little things,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “The discipline on defense, a little more effort in your own approach so the offense is cleaner. It’s remembering what’s working for you and resorting to the game plan, so it’s a lot of little things that combine to help you take that next step.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its postseason quest against division rival Cal Poly on Friday, Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. in its only match next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/","id":5433,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5432,5431,5430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Back-to-Back Shutout Losses Damper UCSB’s Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-16-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-16-16_7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For the first time this season, the UCSB women's soccer team experienced back-to-back losses in its two road matches at UC Riverside and UC Irvine.

The action started in the 18th minute when Highlander senior midfielder Blanca Barrio rebounded her own shot to put the ball in the back of the net.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just four minutes later the Highlanders attacked again, this time off of an assist by Barrio to junior midfielder Hailey Maxwell. Maxwell took advantage of the easy pass and put the shot right past Gaucho sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers for a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Maxwell-Barrio duo would strike again before the end of the half. After working hard to carry the ball down into Gaucho territory, Barrio executed a soaring pass into the box where Maxwell responded with a header that would send the ball into the far post and put the score at 3-0.</p>\n<p>While the scoreboard said otherwise at the conclusion of Friday’s match, UCSB did have a few opportunities on offense.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Amanda Ball was able to get one shot off, along with sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin. Senior midfielder Dakota Griggs contributed with two attempts; the Gauchos, however, were unable to get any on goal.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders finished with a total of eight shots while UCSB registered four, all occurring in the second half. Each team saw two corner kicks and two saves.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game against the Anteaters was another disheartening loss for the Gauchos as they were unable to come back from being down a goal in search of the equalizer. After putting a goal on the board early in the first half, the Anteaters’ defense was able to limit the Gauchos’ offense to keep the count at 1-0 for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>The only goal of the game was off of a UCSB mistake when Anteater junior midfielder Alex Karlowitsch intercepted a Gaucho pass. Karlowitsch was then able to transition the steal into an offensive play during which she made a clean pass to teammate redshirt junior defender Noel Baham. Baham then took a shot from 10 yards out to score what would be the only goal of the game.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were unable to complete a single goal, they outshot the Anteaters 13-2. However, only two were on frame while both of the Anteaters’ shots were on goal.</p>\n<p>Gaucho senior defender Sydney Fuertes and Magnin took the most shots for their team with three each. Senior midfielder Ashley Dean and sophomore midfielder Mallory Hromatko each had two.</p>\n<p>“We would love to be as high a seed in our tournament as possible, but we have to win two very tough games late in the season to continue on to the NCAA Tournament, which is one of our final goals for the year,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have just two more games remaining on their regular season and conference schedule. On Thursday, Oct. 27, UCSB will take on the UC Davis Aggies at 7 p.m and will then face the Long Beach State 49ers on Sunday, Oct. 30 at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>In the biggest rivalry in college soccer, the Big West-leading Gaucho men’s soccer team hosted northern neighbor Cal Poly with the chance to clinch the Big West North by sending the visitors home with their second Blue-Green loss in as many weeks. The home fans were rocking, but Santa Barbara couldn’t find a winning goal as the game played out to a 0-0 stalemate following overtime.</p>\n<p>UCSB remains atop the North division with the result at 5-0-3 in Big West play, 9-5-3 overall, five points clear of second-place Sac State, and although the home side failed to clinch the North with a win over the Mustangs, a tie in either of SB’s last two regular season games would essentially clinch the title. As for the Mustangs, the tie leaves the squad at the bottom of the division at 1-5-2 in conference play while standing them at 3-9-3 overall.</p>\n<p>The 11,424 in attendance at Harder made up the largest crowd in the country this season for a men’s soccer game, and the rivalry is now responsible for drawing 15 of the 20 largest regular season crowds in NCAA soccer. Early on, the atmosphere was deafening, students packing the main grandstand to the brim, but as the game played out, both teams settled into what would become a dirty, defensive battle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The visitors seemed to have opened the scoring in the 15th minute when Cal Poly senior defender Kody Wakasa directed the ball past freshman keeper Titouan Le Roux with his right hand and was shown the match’s first yellow for the blatant hand ball.</p>\n<p>After that, the Gauchos were able to create several chances through crosses from the wingers and fullbacks, coming closest in the 22nd minute as senior striker Nick DePuy smashed his towering header off the crossbar and back into play, but no teammates were around before the Mustang defense was able to clear their line.</p>\n<p>The All-American striker was hugely involved in his team’s best chances, including a team-high five shots. Despite his recent scoring troubles, DePuy has been doing everything to get on the scoresheet and is tied for second on the team with six goals this year. His recent dry spell — one goal in last seven matches — even left his teammates and coaches wishing a bit of luck on the frontman.</p>\n<p>“The streak is at eight now. Nick’s hit the post on a header in eight straight games and he did it again tonight,” said Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg half-jokingly. “He’s still getting up and battling for that ball, but it’s just one of those unlucky streaks where he keeps finding the post, and tonight that’s the goal that opens up the whole game. Unfortunate, but Nick played very, very well tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB dominated the match, holding Cal Poly to just one shot in each half, but the Gaucho attack failed to find a goal as it pressed on in the second half and overtime. The Mustangs stacked all but one man behind the ball for the last forty minutes, including OT. Santa Barbara outshot the visitors 10-2, but were ultimately held scoreless for the first time in eleven games.</p>\n<p>The meeting was highly contested with 35 total fouls, and each team had at least two valid penalty claims that were waived on by the referee. In the postgame press conference, Vom Steeg said the allowance of overly physical play made it too difficult for either team to score, and ultimately Poly stayed resolute in the back, earning a tie at Harder for the second straight year.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to generate an attack when they can physically hold you back,” said Vom Steeg. “Nick played great tonight considering its two arms around his waist wrapped up so you can’t get free. You can’t get open in that box because at some point you realize there won’t be a call.”</p>\n<p>Having just beaten Cal Poly on the road last weekend, SB planned on wearing out the Mustangs and taking the game late, and while the coaching staff must have been pleased with how their game plan played out, the offense couldn’t find the moment it needed to break the deadlock. A win would’ve clinched the Big West North for the reigning division champs, but the Gauchos were unable to find the winner and are now forced to grab a positive result this week in order to lock up at least one home game for conference playoffs.</p>\n<p>“It would’ve been nice to get the title in front of the crowd, but the team played really well,” said junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who leads UCSB with 10 goals. “If you play five more minutes we find the goal. At the end they were split up and sliding all over the field, so if we had one final shot, one final pass, we could’ve got the win.”</p>\n<p>The biggest crowd of the year brought an electric energy to the rivalry match, but the game never opened up enough to do the nationally-televised meeting justice, as both teams locked up the opposing attackers and played out the Blue-Green rivalry’s first scoreless draw since 2009.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">SCENES IN THE 15th MINUTE 0-0 STILL IN THE BLUE/GREEN RIVALRY <a href=\"https://t.co/EU178e6k3G\">pic.twitter.com/EU178e6k3G</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus Sports (@thenexus_sports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thenexus_sports/status/790030498114392064\">October 23, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at Sac St. on Wednesday, October 26 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/","id":1401,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1400,1399,1398],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Settling In: Gaucho Freshmen Class Solidifies International Flair","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"There are a total of 29 international student athletes from every corner of the globe playing Big West soccer, and UCSB has nine, tied for the most in the conference with CSUN.

The heavily international roster creates a dynamic that most other collegiate programs are never exposed to.</p>\n<p>When high school seniors commit their futures to college programs, they look for places that promote a preferred style of play or mentality, and it seems that Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has fostered an environment that looks extremely appealing to kids from overseas. Six of the nine freshmen on the current Gaucho roster joined from a range of nations outside the United States.</p>\n<p>Just this week, four of the first-year internationals were listed to the TopDrawerSoccers.com midseason Top-200 Freshman list. Midfielder Daniel Amo (Ghana), fullback Mateo Restrepo Mejia (Canada), winger Noah Billingsley (New Zealand) and goalkeeper Titouan Le Roux (France) are the quartet of top prospects. Amo is the highest ranked at No. 20 on the list and the other three all have experience in the youth setups of their respective national teams.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_73428\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73428\" data-attachment-id=\"73428\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/titouan-le-roux-clears-the-ball-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-22-MSoccer-SLO-EricSwensonNexus-3-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Titouan Le Roux clears the ball.

Mejia has started five matches, but has appeared in every game, serving in countless crosses in his wing-back role.</p>\n<p>“When I came here it was with the objective of playing, so I was ready to play and ready to do everything,” Le Roux said. “It’s my job to play, so I’m glad to be the starting goalkeeper, and I want to keep playing so I keep trying to do my best to keep playing.”</p>\n<p>Billingsley, who played at the U-20s World Cup two years ago for the New Zealand side, has become a key piece of UCSB’s marauding attack, with two goals and two assists.<br>\nTo the credit of his growth over the year, the winger’s dribbling and passing behind striker Nick DePuy has been increasingly noticeable as the year goes on as he grows into his starting role.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73431\" style=\"width: 569px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73431\" data-attachment-id=\"73431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/dustin-harris-daily-nexus-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73431\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=559%2C374\" alt=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" width=\"559\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Amo’s injury forced him to endure a testing month of recovery as the promising midfielder eagerly worked his way back into training. His rehab has almost paid its dividends as he prepares to make a brief cameo in Saturday’s home leg of the Blue-Green rivalry.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating and it hurts, but, I mean, it’s part of the game. But my teammates were right there, very supportive, so I never thought ‘I’m done,’” Amo said. ”They were always there reminding me, like, ‘Oh, you gotta go to rehab.’ The guys were all supportive, so it made it — I wouldn’t say okay because it’s still an injury — but they made it comfortable to be around and go to the games.”</p>\n<p>In his time out, the Accra, Ghana native credited the team’s welcoming and supportive team spirit with helping him through the recovery process. One teammate Amo thanked specifically was senior midfielder Seo-In Kim, who was recovering from a long-term injury alongside him.</p>\n<p>The two spent hours in the gym together fighting back to full strength, and now that both players are back in the rotation, Amo and Kim will get to play together for the first time at some point during the last few games of conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing to see Seo get ready to play because when I got here I didn’t get to see him play, so I wanted to see him play,” Amo said. “He had a lot of sessions with me and I was like, ‘Oh my god, I want to see Seo play.’ This weekend at Cal Poly we were just knocking the ball around and it made me so excited to have him on the field.”</p>\n<p>The relationship between the Ghanaian and Kim, a midfielder born in South Korea before moving to the States, goes to show how UCSB’s soccer program has become a place for multicultural interaction with one of the most diverse squads in the country.</p>\n<p>It’s become a place where student-athletes from every possible background get to collaborate, and Billingsley commented on how joining up with players from so many cultures even shows in the way the Gauchos play.</p>\n<p>“Almost half of our team are from other places in the world, so everyone gets along and there’s no cliques, which is nice,” Billingsley explained. “Everyone is used to a different style of play and comes from different backgrounds, and I think the chemistry is just right, and that alone has won us a couple of games.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s style of play, a high-pressing 4-3-3 with attacking wing backs, has allowed the German midfielder Kevin Feucht to shine this season — the junior leads the Big West with 10 goals — as the focal point of the Gauchos’ exciting offense that allows the creative players to express themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the influence of already having upperclassmen foreign players on the team helping the younger guys adapt to the new pressures of college life and finding resources on campus, it’s clear how much these international athletes stick together.</p>\n<p>Le Roux mentioned the helpfulness of his teammates as he struggled with people “speaking too quick for me,” and the assistance extended to basic tasks associated with moving somewhere new.</p>\n<p>“The older guys know about stuff we have to go through, like getting a new phone plan and bank account and that sort of stuff, and then all the other things like being away from home; it’s really nice to have people there whenever I need to talk about something,” Billingsley said.</p>\n<p>The benefits of a multicultural presence extend beyond the lines of the field as players learn about and compare their teammates’ ways of life with one another.</p>\n<p>The Harder Stadium melting pot is a rare occurrence in college sports, and it is a premier example of the intrigue of diversity in soccer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Better known as the Blue-Green rivalry, it is a rivalry that has emerged as the nation’s most prolific duel to date.</p>\n<p>Ranked as the No. 1 rivalry on <em>CollegeSoccerNews.com’s</em> list of “The Fourteen Greatest Rivalries in College Soccer,” the meeting between the Gauchos and Mustangs has continued to meet the expectations and anticipation of audiences nationwide.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With both programs being members of the Big West North Division, the storied matchup is an annual battle that takes place twice a year, giving fans the opportunity to brag and express pride in supporting the Gauchos or Mustangs.</p>\n<p>A match full of intensity and high emotion, goals are a rarity that take much effort, as 16 of the last 19 matches between UCSB and Cal Poly have been decided by one goal or have resulted in a draw.</p>\n<p>Thus far, it has been UCSB with the advantage over Cal Poly. The Gauchos’ all-time record when facing their Central Coast rival is 46-18-8 after a recent 2-1 defeat of the Mustangs last Saturday while on the road in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>In his 18th season with UCSB, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg owns a 23-7-6 record when facing the Mustangs. It has been nearly two decades since his takeover of the Gauchos’ sideline, yet no introduction to the Blue-Green rivalry was needed for Vom Steeg in his transition to the helm as he was a student and soccer player at UCSB from 1985-1988.</p>\n<p>While the rivalry is one that expands across generations of athletes, students and fans, the classic match has consistently increased in popularity on a national scale.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the 2007 season, the total amount of people that have witnessed the Gaucho-Mustang battle exceeds the 200,000 mark.</p>\n<p>The contest has even surpassed the attendance numbers of postseason competition that has occurred in both NCAA Tournament and College Cup games, resulting in eight of the highest attended collegiate games in the U.S. in the last four years.</p>\n<p>Although on the road, last Saturday’s attendance of 11,075 signaled the seventh sellout for a Cal Poly men’s soccer game in program history. It is a game that has sold out Alex G. Spanos Stadium for the past six seasons.</p>\n<p>Increasing in size with the addition of 1,097 attendees, the attendance of the last five meetings between UCSB and Cal Poly — dating back to 2011-2015 — has not fell below the total of 12,805.</p>\n<p>Well deserving of its moniker as the “Soccer Heaven” of collegiate soccer, Harder Stadium has been a hub to the multitude of attendance records set over the years.</p>\n<p>Over the course of nine straight years, UCSB has led Division I men’s soccer in average attendance. For the last two seasons, it has recorded the top average of 3,844 fans per match. The Gauchos’ 5,873 attendees per match in 2010 remains the highest average since the NCAA began accounting for the statistical category in 1998.</p>\n<p>Last season’s two meetings concluded with single-game attendance highs for both programs as they were the only two schools to reach tens of thousands.</p>\n<p>The total of 14,919 fans that attended the second matchup between the Gauchos and Mustangs at Harder Stadium ranked above all games on the list. Following was the first game of the 2015-2016 Blue-Green series in which 11,075 people were in attendance.</p>\n<p>Since the reinstatement of men’s soccer into the Big West Conference in 2001, the Blue-Green bout has gradually grown each year as the purpose of the rivalry has extended beyond the field, becoming a ritual amongst both universities. The Blue-Green game is the only exception in which students are allowed to storm the field at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>The legend of the Blue-Green rivalry continues this Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. and will be nationally televised by Fox Sports Prime Ticket for the fourth consecutive year.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/","id":1428,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1427,1426,1425],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain at T-Dome for the Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web2.jpg?resize=681%2C467&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team will look to win back-to-back conference games for the first time this season as it faces LBSU and CSUN.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team is looking forward to weekend matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge, facing both opponents for the second time this season.<br>\nThe Gauchos host the 49ers boasting a 12-8 overall record, 3-4 in conference after splitting a pair of Big West games for the second straight week.

We were really without Phoebe completely, and Lindsey played just a little bit since it was her first match back after hardly practicing,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “Even with the team we had on the floor last time, we felt confident that if we had cleaned up a few things, [the match] would have gone a different way. Now we just have more strength.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins will look to regain her early season magic as she continues to get her feet back under her after an injury derailed her contributions early in the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman — eighth in Big West play with 3.64 kills per set — and freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis — fifteenth in conference play with 2.76 kills per set — will accompany Ruddins in a now fairly healthy Gaucho attack.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will also be back after playing in some light action last weekend, and she, too, will hope to reproduce her early season dominance.</p>\n<p>The defense, as usual, will be centered around sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who continues to lead the Big West in digs per set with 4.72 and total digs with 326.</p>\n<p>The libero also earned her second Big West Defensive Player of the Week Honors of the season after registering 49 digs in two matches last week against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to use its home court advantage to its full benefit in hopes of extending its one win over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday into a winning streak.</p>\n<p>The longest streak it has put together thus far this season is fives games, which occurred in the earlier portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>When on the losing end of the spectrum, the Gauchos have not tended well, having been swept in six of their eight losses losses this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Long Beach State at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, and Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 22, with both games being played at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The 49ers take on their GCC foe with an 11-5 record on the campaign and a perfect 1-0 start as well after defeating Pepperdine at home last week. Like Santa Barbara, Long Beach State also decided to leave the MPSF and join the newly created Golden Coast Conference for a chance at capturing a conference title.</p>\n<p>Since starting the season 6-0, the Beach has slowed down as of late, posting a 5-5 record over the last 10 matches with all five losses coming against higher-ranked teams.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB and LBSU have met once this season, at the Mountain Pacific Invitational, in a match that ultimately went the 49ers’ way as they cruised to a solid 9-6 victory.<br>\nAt the time, Santa Barbara was ranked No. 6 in the country while the No. 7 spot belonged to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The two positions flipped after the loss and have stayed that way ever since. Knowing this, not only is this a match for conference supremacy but also for bragging rights as to who can rightfully claim that No. 6 spot.</p>\n<p>As this match will be played at home for the Gauchos and will be their second night game this season, they will have a great mindset knowing they will have a rambunctious, energetic crowd behind them like the one in attendance last week against San Jose State, their conference opener.</p>\n<p>However, facing the Spartans and facing the 49ers are two different stories. Even before this season, LBSU and UCSB have been conference rivals during their time in the MPSF. These two programs have played a total of 118 matches with the majority of the wins going to the Beach, who hold a 60-58 record all-time.</p>\n<p>The talent level Santa Barbara will be facing in this conference match will be much different, something it knows all to well after its last meeting just a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>In that match, attacker Nolan McConnell led all scorers with four goals, all in the first half for Long Beach State. By the end of the first frame, the senior already tallied a hat trick. This season the senior ranks third in the GCC in goals with 31, best on his team, and leads his team in points with 33.</p>\n<p>In the cage for the Beach, sophomore Thomas Freeman has excelled; he currently has the best save percentage of any player with two or more starts in the Golden Coast at .667, while his goals allowed per game is also tops with six scores per game. His 97 saves are good for third best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Facing such a tough foe, the Gauchos will need their best players to shine in their primetime showdown. One of the players they’re counting on is senior utility Reed Cotterill. Two weeks ago, he was honored with the inaugural Golden Coast Conference Offensive Player of the Week after four goals against No. 8 Pepperdine. This season, Cotterill leads his team in steals (12), goals scored (23) and points (28).</p>\n<p>Other notable players include junior attacker Shane Hauschild, who has been an offensive force this season, scoring 17 goals and tacking on nine assists for a total of 26 points, second best on the team. Sophomore driver Boris Jovanovic has also been solid, scoring 19 goals this season — second best on the squad — and netting a hat-trick against UCLA last week.</p>\n<p>In what turned out to be a dominant double header Saturday for the Gauchos as they defeated La Verne and Whittier College by a combined score of 31-5, freshman Ivan Gvozdanovic and Connor Wilde finished that day with four goals apiece.</p>\n<p>Liam Lenihan has also been great in the cage for UCSB. The senior goalkeeper was solid last week, allowing just eight goals in three matches against San Jose State, La Verne and Whittier College. His 79 total saves are good enough for fourth best in the conference.</p>\n<p>With their second conference night game underway tonight, there is no way the Gauchos aren’t super stoked for this game. Last week Campus Pool was a packed house, and the same is expected tonight as the game has much more at stake and it is with a much more familiar opponent.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Long Beach State on Thursday, Oct. 20, at 7 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UC Davis drops into third in the division and now sit at 7-7-2 overall and 3-4-0 in the conference.</p>\n<p>Early on, the Aggies looked like the team that could possibly knock off the rolling Gauchos, outshooting the visitors 7-3 in the opening third of the match, including the first goal of the afternoon in the 7th minute when Kyle Higgins unlocked the affair. Davis dominated most of the first half and held firmly onto their lead going into the break as Santa Barbara was unable to create any real opportunities.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the second half, though, UCSB’s feared offense was back to its normal self, creating a couple of close chances before junior forward Ahinga Selemani chipped a ball to the back post for junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who headed the ball down for the equalizer, adding the tenth goal to his conference-leading tally. The German now also climbs to seventh in the national goal-scoring leaderboards.</p>\n<p>Although Selemani’s four-game scoring streak snapped in the win, he still managed to come up with the same opportunistic play that has made him such a threat up front this season by winning the ball off a missed clearance and finally cracking open the airtight UCD defense.</p>\n<p>After the leveling goal, both teams settled down and mostly waited for overtime, making several defensive substitutions and deciding against creating too many chances at the risk of conceding on the counter. In the extra period, though, the Gauchos brought on plenty of attacking force, and their forward efforts were rewarded almost immediately in the 92nd minute when DePuy finally got back on the score sheet.</p>\n<p>Sophomore defender Dalton Pando sent a long ball in behind the Aggie defensive line, where DePuy brought it down, smoothly beating his man before firing home his sixth of the season to tie Selemani for second on the team. Funnily enough, the OT winner fulfilled team-leader Feucht’s prophecy when he guaranteed a goal from his struggling frontman in their next match following last Saturday’s win against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The win continued the hot streak the Gauchos have been on since conference has begun, and the team now rides their seven-game unbeaten run — their longest in three seasons — into the home clash with Cal Poly on Saturday. UCSB will be hoping to win both legs of the Blue-Green rivalry as well as avenge the last-second goal the Mustangs scored to tie it up before holding onto the 2-2 result in overtime when they travelled to Harder last year.</p>\n<p>That match will be played Saturday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium, with a chance to sell out the 17,000 seat stadium for the biggest rivalry in college soccer. The game will be televised on Fox Sports, and admission is free with an ACCESS card.

Fresh off a comeback victory against UC Davis this Wednesday and having already beaten the Mustangs once this season, the gauchos are in a great position for the weekend to come.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host their bitter, green rival boasting a solid 9-5-2 overall record and an unbeaten 5-0-2 Big West record, good enough for first place in the entire conference with 14 total points. Cal Poly comes into town with a deflating 3-9-2 overall record and a 1-5-1 conference record placing them dead last in the entire Big West with four points.</p>\n<p>For the second straight week, these two teams will meet on Saturday night in front of an exuberant home crowd. After falling behind 1-0 early in the match just five days ago, Santa Barbara stormed back with goals from red-hot juniors Ahinga Selemani and Kevin Feucht to win the game 2-1.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The victory put the all-time record between these two squads at an even further distance as the Gauchos now lead the series all-time 46-18-8 and 23-7-6 during the Tim Vom Steeg era. The win was also a huge confidence boost as last year UCSB was winless in the two-match series going 0-1-1.</p>\n<p>Last season’s match at Harder Stadium was certainly an instant classic. The game attracted 14,919 spectators, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history, and ended in a stunning 2-2 tie after Cal Poly scored the equalizer with only four seconds left, overcoming what seemed to be an insurmountable 2-0 lead held by the home team for most of the match.</p>\n<p>With that being the lasting moment the remaining Gauchos had of the match against the Mustangs last year, it’s safe to say they are ready to come out and defeat them in front of what could be the largest crowd in NCAA history by the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Also on the line, Santa Barbara’s chance to sweep Cal Poly for the first time since 2006. That year also marked UCSB’s first and only national championship in program history.</p>\n<p>Hoping to deflate the home team and give them their first loss of the conference season will be senior forward Justin Dhillon who ranks third in the conference in goals scored with seven. The winger has scored 70 percent of the team’s total goals all season. His 17 total points also rank him first on his team, third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite his great offense play, no other Mustang really comes to mind. Despite not scoring in last week’s match, the senior assisted in the only goal scored by Cal Poly in that game as freshman midfielder Christian Enriquez scored the first goal of his young career.</p>\n<p>One player to watch out for is Kody Wakasa. The senior defender made the shot of his life last season for his team scoring the game winning golden goal against the Gauchos in a 3-2 win at Cal Poly. This season Wakasa has registered one goal and has played exceptional in the back end, which has done a solid job despite what the overall record might entail.</p>\n<p>In fact, goalkeeper Eric Kam has been great for most of the season. The junior has the second-best goals allowed against average in the Big West with 1.21, while his save percentage of .706 ranks fourth in the conference with UCSB’s freshman goalie Tituoan Le Roux.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been on fire as of late, especially the trio of DePuy, Selemani and Feucht. All three players are in the top-five goal scorers in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Feucht’s 10 goals rank first in the conference while also ranking seventh best in the entire nation. The midfielder scored the equalizer to help send the game into overtime against UC Davis on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Because of the Feucht’s goal, DePuy was able to score the 16th game winner of his career in front of the Aggies home stadium. Despite not having the season he had last year when he scored 15 goals and led the entire nation, the striker has still made a significant impact. In his career, the senior has scored four goals in seven appearances against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least on the list, is Selemani. Although not extending his goal streak to five matches after failing to score against UC Davis, the junior had the key assist to Feucht’s equalizer. In two of his three career appearances against Cal Poly, the junior has scored a goal and his six goals this season rank second best on the team, tied with DePuy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73271\" style=\"width: 333px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73271\" data-attachment-id=\"73271\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-19/gauchos-head-to-uc-davis-to-continue-recent-unbeaten-run/jenny-luo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73271\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=323%2C485\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"323\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>On the back end, the Gauchos have been solid thanks to the play of freshman Le Roux. The goalkeeper ranks third in the conference with 60 saves and has not allowed more than one goal in his last six matches; he is a respectable player, having done all this without missing a single minute in 16 starts this season.</p>\n<p>While, on paper, Santa Barbara clearly looks like the more dominant team, Cal Poly certainly has the tenacity to make this an interesting match. If last Saturday’s match was any indicator, the Gauchos might have their hands full this weekend if they are not careful.</p>\n<p>As recognized by most fans of college soccer, the Blue-Green clash is the best soccer rivalry in college soccer to date, and with that title comes the responsibility to give fans the greatest game they could possibly witness. Something tells me this match, like all the others that have been played, will not disappoint.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face off against the Mustangs in the annual Blue-Green rivalry on Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. at Harder Stadium. The game will also be televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>At the forefront of UCSB’s prominent play has been junior forward Ahinga Selemani. “Jings,” as his teammates call him, has been in the best form of his career in recent weeks, scoring in four consecutive matches including the equalizer at SLO shortly after his team fell down 1-0.</p>\n<p>His performances haven’t gone unnoticed either, as the Michigan native earned his second straight Big West Offensive Player of the Week award and topped off the honor by being listed in College Soccer News’  Team of the Week on Monday.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also be receiving a huge boost this week, as freshman standout Daniel Amo returns from a groin injury that’s kept him out for 11 games. He is expecting to ease into the lineup with a cameo in this week’s games. In his six appearances at the start of the year, the versatile center midfielder scored twice and assisted twice and seemed to be linking up perfectly with his teammates.</p>\n<p>“I’m pretty close, and probably gonna get a few minutes, but I have to get into it for a couple weeks to make sure I’m match fit in time for the [Big West] Tournament,” Amo said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the UC Davis clash as the top offense in the conference by quite a large margin. Their 27 team goals on the season total at least three more than any other team. Santa Barbara also features three players in the Big West’s top-5 for goals — junior midfielder Kevin Feucht (9), Selemani (6) and All-American striker Nick DePuy (5) — as well as the second assists leader in Josue España (7).</p>\n<p>At the other end of the field, though, defensive struggles plagued the team as it went on a five-game losing streak. Thankfully for UCSB, freshman keeper Titouan Le Roux has come into his own through the Big West season thus far, including a couple crucial stops in last weekend’s Blue-Green rivalry victory over the Mustangs. The first-year Frenchman has played every minute in goal for the Gauchos this year and has been key in the recent defensive improvements.</p>\n<p>Great goalkeeping paired with defensive reorganization by Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has seemingly fixed their issues with conceding chances on mental lapses suffered in the middle portion of the season. After six games in a row of allowing two or more goals, the back has tightened up noticeably, allowing just four in the last five matches. This includes a clean sheet at home against Irvine, which bodes well with only four regular season games left.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already played against teams like Akron and UCLA, one of these teams will make the Final Four,” Feucht said. “We just have to keep working and improving so we can get to a place to showcase our skills with the best teams.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies will pose a stern test for the Gauchos, as their wall of a back line has allowed a Big West-best 1.10 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Davis is led by sophomore striker Kristian Heptner, whose five goals and 11 points are both team highs. The Davis squad is the only team other than the Gauchos in the conference to attempt over 200 shots on goal this year, so the meeting will more than likely be a wide open affair.</p>\n<p>The match will be played on Wednesday, Oct. 19 at UC Davis at 3 p.m. An audio stream of the game is available on the schedule page of the men’s soccer team’s <em><a href=\"http://ucsbgauchos.com\">ucsbgauchos.com</a></em> website.

After leading Santa Barbara with a team-high four goals in its victory over Whittier the day before, the Serbian native continued his offensive dominance, leading the Gauchos with a hat trick.</p>\n<p>Answering for USC on offense was junior driver Matteo Morelli to tie the score at 1-1.

He finished with a match-high five goals, increasing his count of multi-goal games to eight in addition to having a score in 13 of the Trojans’ 16 games.</p>\n<p>It was a monumental performance for the team’s leading scorer as Edwards became the 33rd player in program history to reach a career total of 100 goals. His five first-half scores guided the Trojans to their 11-5 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The flow of the game was at a standstill in the beginning stages of the second half as both teams attempted a combined nine shots before having the goal drought ended by USC’s junior driver Lazar Pasuljevic’s score with 2:19 remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s lone goal in the second half was junior attacker Nick Wiley. Despite the Gauchos taking a more efficient approach to their shot selection, improving from a 0.81 shooting percentage on 37 shots in their first meeting against the Trojans to a .222 percentage on 27 shots on Sunday, UCSB remained unable to match the Trojans’ attack.</p>\n<p>Ending Sunday’s match with a .485 shooting percentage on 33 shots, USC’s persistence in power-play situations helped the team collect another victory. It finished 3-for-8 on power plays, scoring two in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter to cruise to a 16-6 win.</p>\n<p>In spite of the loss, it was a solid outing for Gaucho senior goalkeeper Liam Lenihan III as he recorded 11 saves, three of which occurred during power plays.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to Campus Pool to face No. 6 Long Beach State on Thursday, Oct. 20 for both its second conference game and night match of the season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73250\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/no-7-ucsbs-winning-streak-snapped-lose-at-no-3-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73250\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/no-7-ucsbs-winning-streak-snapped-lose-at-no-3-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/no-7-ucsbs-winning-streak-snapped-lose-at-no-3-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/no-7-ucsbs-winning-streak-snapped-lose-at-no-3-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/no-7-ucsbs-winning-streak-snapped-lose-at-no-3-usc/","id":5543,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5542,5541,5540],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":68,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
