However, one of the Gauchos biggest tests come this Sunday as they travel south to take on USC, a team they lost 96-72 last season.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Santa Barbara, last season is completely behind them. Last year, UCSB was 1-9 through ten games, this year it comes into the Galen Center boasting an 8-2 overall mark thanks to new Head Coach Joe Pasternack who is off to the best start for a first year coach in program history.</p>\n<p>In <em>collegeinsider.com’s </em>Mid-Major Top 25 poll, UCSB debuted at No. 21 on the list, just one spot below fellow big west opponent UC Davis.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Trojans, the 2017-18 campaign has been very inconsistent.

Currently, UCSB has had impressive victories but a win against a foe from a power-5 conference would be a validation of just how far this team has come in just one year.</p>\n<p>In order for Santa Barbara to pull off the road upset, then it will need spectacular performances from sophomore Max Heidegger and graduate transfer Leland King II.</p>\n<p>Whereas last year Heidegger averaged just 7.6 points per contest on just 27 percent shooting, the guard has completely transformed his game currently sitting as the sixth leading scorer in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Averaging 23.4 points per game this year on a very efficient 47 percent from the field, Heidegger has become the Gauchos number one scoring option. He has also been spectacular from deep as well shooting nearly 44 percent. In six of his last eight matches, Heidegger has scored more than 20 points.</p>\n<p>Along with Heidegger, King II has been a highly welcomed addition to the UCSB squad. In his last game against Montana State, the forward scored a career high 25 points.</p>\n<p>This season King II has averaged 19.2 points per contest, but just as important, he is the team’s leading rebounder averaging 10 boards per game. His 10 rebounds per game is the 22 highest mark in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>In his last five contests, he has accumulated double-doubles averaging 20.2 points per game and 12.4 rebounds per contest.</p>\n<p>In general, as a team, UCSB has been incredible during this seven-game stretch outscoring their opponents by nearly nine points per contest. They are currently the highest scoring team in the Big West averaging 76.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>All that being said, USC is still going to be a very tough team to beat. As a team, the Trojans are averaging 77.4 points per contest while holding their opponents to just 68.8 points. USC is also 4-1 at the Galen Center this season and have lost only four of their last 22 contests at home.</p>\n<p>The Trojans are led by senior guard Jordan McLaughlin who is currently averaging 13.8 points per game and 4.3 rebounds. He also leads the Pac-12 in both assists (6.8) and steals (2.3).</p>\n<p>McLaughlin has been one of the best players in program history as he ranks second on USC’s all-time assists list with 511 and sixth in steals with 159.</p>\n<p>Along with the senior, juniors Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright will be contributing factors as well. Wheras the Gauchos leading rebounder King II stands at 6’7, Metu and Boatwright are 6’11 and 6’10, respectively.</p>\n<p>Metu is the team’s leading rebound averaging 8.5 per game while Boatwright is right behind him averaging 8.3 boards a match. The two are also the team’s leading scorers as Metu averages 16.1 points per game while Boatwright averages 15.4.</p>\n<p>Despite the Gauchos being the hotter team, there is no doubt USC is still a heavy favorite. According to ESPN’s Basketball Power Index, USC is 86.2 percent likely to win while also being favored by 12.5 points.</p>\n<p>Overall, however, the game is played on the court, and for the past seven games, and in reality, the whole season, UCSB has put together some wonderful performances. But it will need to play beyond that to beat USC, a team it hasn’t beaten since 2002.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on the Trojans at 5 p.m. on Sunday, December 17 at the Galen Center. The match will also be streamed on the Pac-12 network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

With their loss to USC, the Lions are polar opposite to the Gauchos, sitting at 7-1.</p>\n<p>Despite their 1-7 start, the Gauchos have found success when they run their offense as envisioned by Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has aimed to orchestrate her team’s offense so that the ball moves through their star in the post, senior forward Drew Edelman. Edelman, while battling a few instances of injuries this year, is averaging team-highs in both points (14.4) and rebounds (8.3) per game.</p>\n<p>However, it seems Edelman is hoping to work her way back to the form she displayed last season when she led the Big West in field-goal percentage (61.4).</p>\n<p>Recently emerging to help Edelman in the scoring department has been redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10 points, 4.1 rebounds and two assists per game on the season.</p>\n<p>She has been living and dying by the three-ball this season, making 10 shots from beyond the arc in the team’s last three contests.</p>\n<p>However, she started the season only making threes in the first six games.</p>\n<p>Overall, Porter is shooting 30 percent from downtown and will hopefully start finding the net on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>In fact in her last three games, she has already shown to be more consistent, knocking down 10 of 25 deep balls.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have also shown glimpses of hot shooting, they should perhaps avoid getting into a high-scoring contest with LMU.</p>\n<p>UCSB this season is averaging 62.8 ppg, about 14 points less a game than the Lions who average nearly 76 points per contest.</p>\n<p>Contributing to its strong offensive presence were valuable performances made by a few talented players.</p>\n<p>Standing out for the Lions is junior Cheyanne Wallace, who is averaging a team-high 19.5 points along with grabbing 7.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Wallace was named the West Coast Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 27.</p>\n<p>Standing at 6’0” in a guard/forward position, Wallace posted 26 ppg and a little over eight boards per game during the week in which she earned the WCC honor.<br>\nShe will certainly be on the Santa Barbara coaching staff’s radar this week, as it will attempt to slow down one of LMU’s best offensive weapons.</p>\n<p>The difficulty for the Gauchos is that LMU has accompanying scoring options to supplement Wallace.</p>\n<p>The Lions have also been getting strong contributions from guard Gabby Green. The 6’2” redshirt junior is in the midst of her debut season at LMU, as she transferred from Berkeley after playing for the Golden Bears for two years.</p>\n<p>In her first year as a Lion, Green has been putting up well-rounded stat lines.</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.9 points to go with 6.4 boards and nearly four assists per game.</p>\n<p>Also, Green has so far blocked 10 shots and recorded 21 steals.</p>\n<p>The closest other Lion to these kinds of numbers is none other than Wallace, who has six blocks and 11 steals on the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will surely have their hands full Thursday night trying to contain LMU’s stars, but UCSB knows it has players who can find the net too such as Edelman and Porter.</p>\n<p>In last year’s meeting between Santa Barbara and the Lions, LMU took the close victory over the Gauchos by just two points, 57-55.</p>\n<p>The year before that loss, the Gauchos also came up short against LMU, so it is likely they will look to redeem themselves.</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s action will tip off at 7 p.m. against Loyola Marymount at the Thunderdome where the Gauchos will look to end their seven-game losing streak and earn their first home win.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Dec. 7, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80073\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80073\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/","id":203,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[202,201,200],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"VIDEO: UCSB Tops Nebraska-Omaha 77-70 For Seventh Straight Victory; Travel For Sat.

Nicolas Eitelbach / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As the weather becomes colder and the fall quarter winds down on campus, so do on-field activities for the UCSB baseball program. After a difficult season last year, finishing with an overall record of 24-32, many others and I were interested to see what would happen to the Gauchos once fall arrived.</p>\n<p>As autumn came and went, the same fall ball clichés that happen to every team across the country occurred; players fought for spots, many took advantage of the weight room and some guys who you thought wouldn’t struggle did, while others you would not expect to do well flourished.</p>\n<p>This is all too typical of fall college baseball. There were, however, several unique and interesting storylines that arose, including the rise of another top prospect in Gaucho blue and gold, a recovering team leader and much more.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Noah Davis, Noah Davis, Noah Davis: Do not forget the name Noah Davis, especially come spring time. Last season, the Gaucho ace was 7-4 as a sophomore with a 4.63 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 81.2 innings pitched. Although still impressive, even Davis himself would tell you those numbers are not good enough, at least for him.</p>\n<p>Last season is last season though.</p>\n<p>Over the summer in the Cape Cod League, Davis garnered the attention by many, if not all, MLB teams after being named to the Top-25 Prospect List by D1 Baseball. In an intentionally limited five appearances for the Cotuit Kettleers, Davis had an ERA of 2.83 against some of the best hitters in the country. As a result, Davis started on the mound every day in the fall, even in an inter-squad game that was the highly anticipated MLB Scout Day.</p>\n<p>Dozens of scouts were there all fall with their radar guns up and ready, seeing Davis reach speeds of up to 97 mph on his fastball and impressive late-life movement on his slider.</p>\n<p>Even though Davis did show a lot of promise in many inter-squad scrimmages, he would leave his fastball up at times, resulting in many hittable pitches from hungry players trying to get noticed by scouts as well.</p>\n<p>“I would not say I faired too well against our competitive hitters, but I can see the way they compete when I’m on the mound,” Davis said after UCSB’s last fall scrimmage of the year. “I don’t think my game stepped up as much as it needed to or as much as I would like it to. My goal for the fall was to stay healthy the whole way through, which I was able to do. I’ve been working on fastball height too, which has taken a step back in the past two weeks, but I am still feeling I’m headed in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>A huge story last season for the Gauchos was the devastating injury to team leader and shortstop Clay Fisher. After medical red-shirting and recovering from Tommy John surgery on his throwing arm, many worried how Fisher would bounce back.</p>\n<p>Although not yet swinging a bat and not throwing at any point this fall, Fisher was still able to participate in many on-field activities. As always, Fisher was smoother than silk on ice during practice and scrimmages. Offensively, due to his recovery process, he could only work on his bunting game in the box.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I feel like I was limited on was taking live at-bats,” Fisher said. “I’ve been taking ground ball reps, I know I can’t throw, but I feel the same in the field as I was in the past so I think I progressed just as well [as anyone else this fall].”</p>\n<p>Many are speculating and questioning the timetable of Fisher’s return, but Fisher wants to let everyone know everything will be alright.</p>\n<p>“I do think that I’ll be 100 percent. It might not be right at the beginning of the season, but I’m definitely making strides. I feel good and I really don’t have any doubts,” the star shortstop said.</p>\n<p>Besides Clay Fisher, other guys were feeling good and not doubting themselves as well. Sophomore Eric Yang, who only had 30 plate appearances in his freshman season, showed up this fall squaring up the pelota, driving the ball gap to gap and around the entire field.</p>\n<p>If you have been paying attention to Yang this summer, though, this is not really a surprise. Again, Yang was another Gaucho who had a fantastic summer hitting .360 with 27 RBI in 36 games in the Great West League for the Medford Rogues.</p>\n<p>Another player who hit the ball well in the fall was junior Michael McAdoo. McAdoo was finding barrel after barrel after barrel all fall, mashing the ball and crushing homeruns in inter-squad games. Making only spot starts and difficult pitch hitting appearances last season, McAdoo hit .227. However, after this breakout fall, with last season’s left fielder Billy Fredrick graduated, McAdoo is making his case to be the Gauchos’ starting left fielder come spring.</p>\n<p>Even the rookies were a cornerstone to how the fall unfolded.</p>\n<p>After having the No. 9 recruiting class in the nation last season, this year the Gauchos were ranked in the top 25 once again at No. 22 in the country by Baseball America.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, some of the youngbloods showed up to play some ball. Three freshmen who can have a potential impact in the spring are RHP Jason Willow, catcher/RHP Christopher Troye and second baseman Marcos Castanon.</p>\n<p>Willow, the Canadian from Victoria, British Columbia, is a loose, goofy 18-year- old who is slowly proving his worth on the mound but has already proved his worth in the clubhouse, as he has no problem keeping the guys loose. When I asked him what it was like being a Gaucho, the freshman gave a typical Willow answer.</p>\n<p>“It’s a cool feeling. I mean, it’s a long time coming, you know, being here, being part of the team. It’s been great so far,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Troye, on the other hand, is all business, especially when he’s on the mound. The catcher, who will see more time as a converted pitcher this season, hit 95 mph on the bump and sat consistently between 93-95 mph when on the mound.</p>\n<p>While working with pitching coach Matt Harvey, Troye developed a curveball and a late-life slider that proved to be devastating when spots were hit. The only question for this young gun will be consistency in the strike zone and location with pitches come springtime. Regardless, Troye’s live arm has already garnered the attention of some MLB scouts.</p>\n<p>The last of the frosh recruits mentioned is second Castanon. Castanon is likely to start at second this year as a true freshman for one reason: This kid can rake.</p>\n<p>Castanon has ridiculous hand eye-coordination to the point where he almost always finds ways to make contact with the ball. Although defense is still a concern for the young infielder, his bat will help him find a way into the lineup.</p>\n<p>Overall, this fall was convincing as the Gauchos look like an improved squad from last year’s team, purely based on talent and by intensity and focus at practice and during games.</p>\n<p>The main concern coming into the fall was pitching as the Gauchos last season had a team ERA of 5.24 and batting average against of .279.</p>\n<p>Both starting pitching and bullpen arms looked a lot more lively and competitive over last year’s squad, but only time will tell if that will hold true. With the first game coming up faster than many think on Feb. 16 at San Diego State, the Gauchos seem poised to have a better season than last year and may surprise many throughout the game of college baseball.</p>\n<p>Fall baseball, otherwise known as Fall Ball, is arguably one of the toughest times for a college baseball player. Not only are players trying to impress coaches, win jobs, get stronger and become more skilled, but they are also battling hundreds of other students in the classroom as well to stay eligible for the spring season.</p>\n<p>As the fall quarter winds down, so does UCSB baseball. As team activities come to a temporary close, it is easy to conclude that the fall was anything but easy for the players.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/","id":4165,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

however, in recent years it has become even more universal.</p>\n<p>While mid-major athletics programs have been around for decades, the reality of the growing stardom of Power 5 conferences has resulted in the gradual dwarfing of these less prestigious schools.</p>\n<p>Similar to many other mid-major programs, UCSB tends to find itself being overlooked within the college sports realm.</p>\n<p>Surely, attractions such as the beach and academics are influential upon UCSB receiving attention amongst the masses.</p>\n<p>They’re even features that help to recruit prospective athletes as well.</p>\n<p>While both are enticing, the lack of having what many would consider a “big name” on the college sports map certainly is a challenge that affects UCSB both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>As a sports fan, the image of attending a game in which the arena or stadium bleachers are filled to capacity was an experience I hoped for.</p>\n<p>Of course, once I submitted my Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) for UCSB, which gives you a sense of how nerve-wracking the recruiting process must be for student-athletes, it was quickly evident that my vision was unlikely to occur.</p>\n<p>Let’s face facts.</p>\n<p>As we all know UCSB, is not a sports powerhouse.</p>\n<p>Not to dismiss the record-breaking attendance numbers for UCSB men’s soccer matches versus Blue-Green rival Cal Poly or even when the Gauchos go head-to-head with the Mustangs in men’s basketball, but the occurrence of these contests occurring twice per season for both sports just isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>Excluding those who follow UCSB sports, many students are even unaware that our school has Division I status.</p>\n<p>In an era of college sports when the destinations of some of the nation’s five-star, McDonald’s All-American and ESPN Top 300 athletes are plastered and glamorized in storylines nationwide, UCSB isn’t home to much of that glitz and glamour.</p>\n<p>But this is what makes UCSB sports special.</p>\n<p>Simply put, it’s the little things that go a long way and speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>While currently in the middle of my fourth year, the chance to observe the accomplishments of different teams has been a wonderful process to witness.</p>\n<p>These accomplishments have been achieved by teams such as men’s soccer, which nearly upset No. 2 seeded Clemson in the Sweet 16 back in 2015.</p>\n<p>This was followed by baseball’s ‘Chomaha’ College World Series run after upsetting No. 2 seeded Louisville in 2016. Along with those two, 2016 also became the year the women’s water polo team won its first Big West tournament title in program history.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, nobody can take away the fact that you’re a winner, regardless of the scale that success took place on.</p>\n<p>Each of the aforementioned wins are UCSB’s own version of “Cinderella” stories, forever cemented in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>UCSB has two national championships in its history — the first by its 1979 UCSB men’s water polo team and the last by its men’s soccer team over UCLA in the 2006 Men’s College Cup.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell what’s in store for UCSB sports in the coming years. Hey, who knows, maybe UCSB’s opportunity to host the 2018 and 2020 Men’s College Cups will bring about some extra motivation and mojo that results in another title for the Gaucho faithful.</p>\n<p>As a senior, I won’t physically be here for that future.</p>\n<p>However, the underdog nature of UCSB sports will always stick with me, and of course, I’ll continue to follow each sport’s success year in and year out in hopes of a big run.</p>\n<p>In the case of mid-major programs like UCSB’s, there’s added motivation to surpass the usually underestimated standard that is placed on them.</p>\n<p>With that being said, the Power 5 conferences may have the better talent according to rankings and other measureables.</p>\n<p>But heart and effort can’t be measured. And those are two things that will always outperform talent.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/","id":3381,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3380,3379,3378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ruddins’s Rise to the Top; Gauchos’ Star Overcomes Setbacks","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Being a star athlete isn't always full of successes and enjoyment.

She’s also had to deal with three difficult years for the team, which has never finished higher than fourth place in her time with UCSB’s program.</p>\n<p>But Ruddins hasn’t faltered, despite the injuries and the losses. Instead, she has excelled, and she is as optimistic as she’s ever been going into next season.</p>\n<p>Given what she’s gone through as a UCSB athlete, such optimism is surprising. Ruddins lost almost all of her true freshman year to an abdominal injury, which forced her to medically redshirt the majority of the season.</p>\n<p>“I had previously torn my [abdominal] in my senior year of high school,” she said. “I played on it for a little and then it strained again and it was continuously bothering me. It was definitely hard, and we had lots of meetings about it, but I’m happy with my choice to take the year to recover.”</p>\n<p>That year off turned out to be a blessing for Ruddins and for the UCSB team. The outside hitter used her recovery time to acclimate to the college game and get ready for her return.</p>\n<p>“The college game is so different than high school and club,” Ruddins said. “Being able to get a full year under my belt of just knowing the schedule and having to watch video and do scouting for the first time and stuff like that, it kind of gave me an upper hand as a freshman in my sophomore year.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins didn’t let the knowledge she soaked up while off the court go to waste, as she took the nation by storm her first full year on the court as a redshirt freshman.</p>\n<p>Her 4.09 kills were tops on the team and the fourth best of any freshman in the country in 2016, and she recorded a team-high eight double-doubles (kills and digs).</p>\n<p>Her end-of-season awards list was lengthy, with the Big West Freshman of the Year award and a spot on the AVCA All-American Honorable Mention list serving as the highlights.</p>\n<p>That season was also UCSB’s best, as it went 13-3 in Big West play in 2013 to earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. The Gauchos went 17-12 overall and 8-8 in the Big West, finishing in fourth place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Ruddins had overcome a major obstacle and established herself as a rising star. Then, injuries reared their ugly head once again.</p>\n<p>During a practice in mid-September of her redshirt freshman season, Ruddins came down hard on a teammate’s foot and rolled her ankle. She only missed two matches that season as a result but underwent reconstructive ankle surgery in the offseason.</p>\n<p>That made for two major injuries for Ruddins in only two seasons, a terrible enough ratio to raise serious doubts toward her returning to the court. Ruddins, however, was ready to recover and rally once again.</p>\n<p>“I’ve suffered through many injuries in my career, unfortunately,” Ruddins said. “Coming back from that is always tough, but I love volleyball and I feel like volleyball has made me pretty mentally strong.”</p>\n<p>For the second time in her collegiate career, Ruddins underwent the grueling process of rehab. She spent her offseason in physical therapy, working with trainer Bob Annable to rebuild her ankle and get herself back into playing shape.</p>\n<p>In a sport as dynamic as volleyball, injuries are just a part of the game. That’s especially true for outside hitters, who spend as much time in the air as any other player on the court.</p>\n<p>In a way, then, the injuries were hardly a surprise to Ruddins, who hails from a volleyball family and has spent a major chunk of her life playing the sport.</p>\n<p>“My aunt [Kim Ruddins] actually played for USC and in the Olympics, and then my dad played for Long Beach, so it was kind of in my family,” Lindsey said. “My older sister started playing club volleyball in eighth grade, but we had always kind of played with my dad and aunt.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins credits her older sister, Elise, for providing the most direct inspiration for taking up volleyball. The elder Ruddins sister wound up following in her aunt’s footsteps and played on the USC team.</p>\n<p>“[Elise] was actually getting offers her freshman year of high school,” Ruddins said. “It was so fun watching her, and then I started playing.”</p>\n<p>Just like her older sister, Lindsey Ruddins started getting noticed by colleges in her freshman year of high school, but she was drawn toward blazing her own trail to UCSB.</p>\n<p>The third and final Ruddins sister, Gail, will follow that trail next season, giving the Ruddins family two Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Gail Ruddins will be joining a UCSB team coming off an up-and-down season marked with a mixture of highs and lows. For Lindsey Ruddins, however, the season was mostly highs.</p>\n<p>The redshirt sophomore was quiet in her first match back, posting just eight kills in a three-set loss to Illinois State to start the season. That match quickly proved to be an outlier, however.</p>\n<p>A match against Florida State the next day saw Ruddins post a match-high 36 kills as well as 18 digs for her first double-double of the season. That match was also the beginning of Ruddins’s double-digit kill streak, which will continue into next season.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the star outside hitter set a rally-scoring era record for single-match kills with 36, falling two kills short of tying former Gaucho Roberta Gehlke’s school record 38 kills against Long Beach State on Sept. 30, 1999.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was a terror throughout non-conference play, posting four double-doubles in eight matches. However, none of those double-doubles turned into wins for the Gauchos, who won only one of their non-conference matches and entered Big West play with a 1-11 record.</p>\n<p>“[The season] definitely started off rough, you could say,” Ruddins said. “We had four freshmen and a transfer come in, and they came into a team that had been through so much. They all tried from the very beginning and wanted to get better and showed improvement. As a team, our rough preseason just made us work harder.”</p>\n<p>Life got a little easier for UCSB once Big West matches started up. The Gauchos went 7-9 in their conference and played Cal Poly, the eventual league champions, in a close match in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“Towards the end of the year, things finally started to come together,” Ruddins said. “I’m super excited for next year.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins’s dominance, on the other hand, continued unabated. The outside hitter had eight double-doubles in Big West competition and ran off three in a row to close out the season.</p>\n<p>Her rate of 6.30 kills per set in conference play was the best of any Big West player and almost two kills better than the next closest attacker.</p>\n<p>Such strong performance garnered plenty of attention, both regionally and nationally. Ruddins won four Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week awards during the 2017 season and earned a spot on the All-Big West First Team.</p>\n<p>Nationally, Ruddins was named AVCA National Player of the Week in October on the strength of a three-match killing spree against UC Davis, Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Given her position atop the kills-per-set leaderboard, it’s likely she will be named to the AVCA All-American First Team as well.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of accolades for one person. Nevertheless, Ruddins doesn’t think too much of it all.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, it’s nothing,” the outside hitter said. “It’s not an award for me, it’s for our team. I’ve gotten awards before and it’s cool to get the recognition, but it’s not just me.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins might not be too impressed with her own play, but most observers are, especially considering what she’s overcome to earn those awards. Not only do the Gauchos have the best attacker in the nation, they might just have the toughest.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80078\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80078\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/","id":4935,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4934,4933,4932],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Can UCSB Baseball Return to CWS Form in 2017-18?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Baseball-170226-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Baseball-170226-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was another successful offseason for the UCSB baseball team, who is looking to return in 2018 with a vengeance.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Following last season’s 24-32 overall record, as well as their 8-16 finish in the Big West conference, the team will look to lean on these new recruits to return them to the postseason.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s top-ranked recruit, Jason Willow, was drafted in the 24th round of the 2017 MLB draft by the Baltimore Orioles but opted to forego turning pro.</p>\n<p>The 6’2’’ infielder finished with a .634 slugging percentage in his senior year, and even spent time with the Canadian national team.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hopes that JUCO transfer Cole Kleszcz will further improve their lineup.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old outfielder, who was drafted by the Indians in the 40th round, hit over .400 his freshman year, along with an equally impressive one to one walk to strikeout ratio.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly for what was at times a defensive-deficient Gauchos team last season, Kleszcz won a gold glove for his defensive play in center field.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also brought in two top-ranked pitching recruits, Jorge Arellano and Ben Fariss, to bolster a rotation that struggled to a 5.24 ERA in 2017. Arellano, the fifth-rated LHP in California, recorded 51 strikeouts in 38 innings last season for Downey High School and was drafted in the 36th round by the Indians.</p>\n<p>Fariss featured as a two-way star at Valencia High School in California, hitting .368 as a senior outfielder while also pitching his way to a 3.43 ERA.</p>\n<p>In addition to these recruits, UCSB will return star shortstop Clay Fisher, who opted to return for his senior year rather than go pro due to circumstances outside his control.</p>\n<p>Fisher’s season was cut short by Tommy John surgery last year, and he will be welcomed back with open arms after hitting .353 his sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>UCSB won’t have much time to adjust, as they take on San Diego State to open the season Feb.16.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs, who finished last season 41-19 and advanced to the regional semifinals, will present a stark challenge for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After coming home for their opener against Fresno State, UCSB must take on a formidable Mississippi State team that reached the Super Regionals last year as part of the Kleberg Bank Classic Tournament in Texas.</p>\n<p>Other notable non-conference games include a home series against Penn State March 3, as well as a three-game homestand against reigning WAC conference champion Sacramento State beginning March 16.</p>\n<p>After its final nonconference game March 27 at Pepperdine, UCSB will return home to begin conference play against Cal State Fullerton, a perennial contender in the Big West who reached the College World Series last year.</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara lost two of its three games against Fullerton, and the game will allow the Gauchos to gauge whether they will be contenders or pretenders in the conference this season.</p>\n<p>April features primarily conference games for the Gauchos, with a home and away game interspersed against USC.</p>\n<p>UCSB swept the Pac-12 school last year in their two games, and will look to do more of the same this season during the midweek matchups.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the season, Santa Barbara will get its hand at Long Beach State, the 2017 Big West champion who beat Santa Barbara in two of its three matchups last year.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos hope to contend in the Big West this season, they will likely need to win the series against the 49ers, which begins May 11.</p>\n<p>With a much healthier, more experienced team and an abundance of talented recruits, UCSB will look to prove that last season was merely a fluke and that this year’s team can replicate the Cinderella success that this team was able to find in 2016.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Having only lost one game to No. 1 UCONN, UCLA improved to 7-1.</p>\n<p>The Bruins dominated their opponents in every aspect of the game, making the visitors work hard for each bucket they attempted.</p>\n<p>Nothing came easy for Santa Barbara. The aggression of UCLA’s defense suppressed the Gauchos’ offense, allowing very little throughout the four quarters.</p>\n<p>The home team held UCSB to just 34 percent shooting, while also putting pressure on the ball and causing their opponents to commit 23 costly turnovers.</p>\n<p>The entire game was a lopsided disparity. The Bruins outperformed Santa Barbara in every statistical category.</p>\n<p>UCLA made its presence known at home. It shot 47 percent from the field, grabbed 45 rebounds and scored a whopping 30 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing for the entire game, a bright spot for UCSB was having redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman back in uniform after she missed the team’s previous game versus Fresno State.</p>\n<p>She led the team in scoring, tallying 12 points on 6-for-11 shooting. Edelman, along with redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter who contributed 11 points, each managed to snatch a team-leading five rebounds.</p>\n<p>The depth and quality of UCSB’s bench has been evidently consistent and one of the most notable advantages of the team since the beginning of the season (averaging 23 points per game) – but such was not the case against the No. 7 team in the nation. The Bruins has 26 bench points, compared to their UCSB’s 19.</p>\n<p>Poor fourth quarter play has been a recent issue for the Gauchos, but against the Bruins, it was a different tale. A positive takeaway for UCSB in this game, was their resilience in the final quarter despite allowing a huge run in the third.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara outscored its opponent 17-14 in the final period of the game.</p>\n<p>UCLA was in the driver’s seat all game, scoring double-digits in every quarter, while limiting Santa Barbara to just two double-digit quarters.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara was only down 14 points and trailing 32-18 at the half, UCLA busted the game wide open immediately after.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was when the home team got increasingly aggressive, not giving its opponent any leeway as it only allowed nine points, while the Bruins exploded for 28 in the third.</p>\n<p>There were commanding performances all around for the Bruins, as senior forward Monique Billings recorded a game-high 17 points along with bagging 10 rebounds along the way.</p>\n<p>Alongside Billings, was senior guard Jordin Canada who added 14 points, an impressive six steals and garnished her performance with five assists.</p>\n<p>The Bruins packed the paint, suffocating the Gauchos’ offense under the basket. The Gauchos were outscored 46-18 in the paint, and gave away 22 offensive rebounds to the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Despite a strong fourth quarter, UCSB does not have much time to work on its woes as its next game arrives at a quick turnaround.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will go head-to-head versus Loyola Marymount at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 7.</p><div

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball team had a triumphant return home Saturday night against the University of San Diego, grinding out a 67-57 victory.</p>\n<p>This was Gauchos’ fifth-straight win, their biggest streak since March 2015, and the team now has as many wins as they had all of last season with a 6-2 record. The Toreros are now building the wrong kind of streak as this was their second loss in a row, and they now sit at 5-2.</p>\n<p>Most of the first half could be summed up with one word: sloppy. The first two minutes included six missed shots, two missed free-throws, two turnovers, and zero points. The Gauchos didn’t even score until three minutes in, when graduate transfer Marcus Jackson took advantage of an errant pass and took it home for a dunk. Jackson finished with an all-around stat line of 12 points 3 rebounds and 4 assists, yet his biggest impact was on the defensive end where he was tasked with facing the Toreros’ best player in Isaiah Wright.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wright came into the matchup leading his team in almost all offensive categories, and postgame Coach Joe Pasternack reiterated just how important it was for the Gauchos to have held him to only 11 points on 5/14 shooting on the game. “We knew he was the head of the team”, Pasternack expressed. “Marcus and the rest of the squad did a great job cutting off the head and forcing the ball elsewhere”.</p>\n<p>The head of the Gauchos for the first half was Leland King II, who finished the game with yet another double-double performance of 18 points and 12 rebounds. He was the only one who had anything going early on, at one point scoring eight straight points on consecutive trips.</p>\n<p>The forward knew that he was going to have to produce early on for the team to have success. “They were switching the point guard on me so I used my size early on”, he admitted postgame. “It’s all about drawing attention to make the game easier for my teammates”.</p>\n<p>Although guard Olin Carter III had a solid first half for USD, in which he picked up eight points, no other player stepped up for the Toreros which led to a 32-25 lead for UCSB going into halftime.</p>\n<p>The second half was all about digging deep on the defensive end for the Gauchos and just letting the offense flow naturally. This was made much easier by the shooting of Max Heidegger, who after a quiet first half made a few key shots as the game came down to the wire. The 8th leading scorer in the country showcased why he deserves national acclaim, at one point he had consecutive possessions with long Steph Curry-like threes, one of which became and And-1 as he got fouled coming down.</p>\n<p>USD’s best players came out to play in the second half however, as forward Isaiah Pineiro almost had a double double in the half alone, getting 12 points and 8 rebounds. Junior Isaiah Wright also played far better, knocking in 10 points and at one point they had cut the lead down to four points.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the Gauchos defense was too much for the Toreros. Coach Pasternack emphasized after the game that: “This team’s identity is defense,” and from the way in which the Gauchos performed, it would be hard to argue against him.</p>\n<p>Having a strong and communicative defense is essential for any team that wants to have prolonged success, which is what Coach P and the Gauchos seem to be laying the foundation for now.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

While the Gauchos used a variety of lineups to try to generate some offense, the Bulldogs used a hot start from freshman forward Maddi Utti to go up 20-7 with 1:14 left in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Utti scored 10 of her game-high 20 points in the first quarter. She ended up shooting 9-for-10 from the field and pulled down eight boards for the Bulldogs.</p>\n<p>As Fresno St. pressured the Gauchos much of the game using a full-court press, the Santa Barbara offense was disrupted.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates, who ended the game with 11 points, explained her team’s early struggles.</p>\n<p>“Honestly the pressure wasn’t that amazing. I freaked out with the ball sometimes and then once we got comfortable we realized there’s teams who play way better defense than that,” I said. “They’re not any better than we are, we’re just making mistakes. So it’s not necessarily the pressure it’s just us [needing to be] comfortable on offense, slowing down and making the right plays.”</p>\n<p>With roughly a minute to go, the Gauchos bounced back from their cold start as senior forward Chaya Durr knocked down two free throws to get things rolling. Then, sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez and senior guard Makala Roper hit two threes, Roper’s at the buzzer, to end the first period with an 8-0 run. UCSB found itself behind the Bulldogs 20-15.</p>\n<p>Despite managing to play from behind and cut the deficit, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson was unhappy with her team’s performance early, and stressed the importance of starting games with the right attitude.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to have a better start, obviously, and better energy, and better discipline on the defensive end. This team’s got to grow where they get some energy from the defensive end,” Henrickson said. “I think we get really excited when we make threes. I don’t think we get really excited from a stop. We’ve got to be more aggressive in the passing lanes, more aggressive on the ball.”</p>\n<p>With the second quarter underway, the Gauchos’ offensive struggles returned as they did not score until the 6:53 mark.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter came off the bench to drain two threes to tie the game at 23 apiece with 4:20 remaining. Porter, one of only three Gauchos in double digit scoring, contributed 12 points off the bench. The Bulldogs answered with a 9-3 run to close out the quarter, ending the half up 32-26.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to settle down during halftime, coming out with a more focused energy to start the third.</p>\n<p>After going down 40-31 with roughly four minutes to go, the Gauchos went on an 11-4 run to close out the quarter and cut the Bulldog lead to two. Santa Barbara used three pointers from Aliceah Hernandez, Sarah Porter and Sarah Bates plus a five-point quarter from Durr for its run. Durr scored a team-high 16 points and pulled down a team-high six boards.</p>\n<p>“We finally settled down. But there’s no reason for us to be down at home right away,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Down 44-42 to start the fourth, Durr scored on a nice drive to the basket to tie the game at 44. Although the Gauchos shot below 40 percent from the free-throw line, beyond the arc and overall, they took their first lead of the night with 7:26 left in the game.</p>\n<p>Hernandez gave her team the lead off a made three-ball, but it would be Santa Barbara’s only lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs pulled ahead again with 5:21 remaining to take a 52-50. Santa Barbara’s defense had a hard time stopping Candice White and Maddi Utti in the final minutes. White and Utti scored eight and six in the period, respectively, to pull Fresno St. ahead 60-54 with 46 seconds to go. White, a junior guard, ended the game with 19 points and a game-high 11 boards.</p>\n<p>Following a UCSB timeout, Hernandez came off a screen to quickly drain a three, but with only 39 seconds left, the Gauchos were forced to foul.</p>\n<p>Up 60-57, the Bulldogs missed two free throws but got the ball back on a long rebound, forcing Santa Barbara to foul again. The Gauchos couldn’t get any other desperation threes to fall, losing the game by a final score of 64-57.</p>\n<p>After the game, Coach Henrickson addressed her team’s performance on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have everybody on the same page, right now, defensively,” she said. “I love our confidence, but our discipline is ridiculous. We’ve got to develop more discipline. We’ve got to play the right way, there’s a purpose to what we’re trying to do.”</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos losing their sixth straight, there are obvious improvements that need to be made so that Santa Barbara can play with more consistency rather than having to catch up.</p>\n<p>“We had a really good practice [Wednesday] so we’re waiting for this to transition from practice to consistency in a game,” Henrickson said. “Everybody’s disappointed, not discouraged. I still believe we’ve got a chance.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have a chance to bounce back when they visit No. 7 UCLA on Sunday, Dec. 3 at 1:30 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion.</p><div

lead.</p>\n<p>Those would be the guard’s only points until close to the end of the first half, as the Big West Player of the Week was never really able to find his footing on the offensive end, going 5-for-15 from the field for 18 points.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, both senior Gabe Vincent and graduate transfer Marcus Jackson were more than ready to step into the offensive role that Heidegger usually filled.</p>\n<p>Vincent has seen his production go down this year, which isn’t too surprising coming off a major injury.</p>\n<p>The guard scored 11 points in the first half, and had an answer for each USF make.</p>\n<p>He made a pivotal shot halfway through the first; when the Gauchos had conceded two shots in a row and trailed by five, he knocked in a long jumper to keep it a one-possession game. Down the stretch, both he and Jackson made tough plays that offset some of the problems UCSB had rebounding.</p>\n<p>Jackson finished with 10 points on 3-of-6 shooting from the field and a 2-for-3 performance behind the 3-PT line.</p>\n<p>For the Dons, senior forward Chase Foster played a huge role in ensuring that the game was tied at halftime.</p>\n<p>He scored or assisted on the last eight points of the half and led both teams at halftime with 14 points.</p>\n<p>His outside shooting (2-for-4 in the first half from three) spread the Gauchos’ defense out, which was key in the rebounding advantage that the Dons took into halftime.</p>\n<p>In the second half, the talent of the Gauchos was just too much for the Dons as the game devolved into a slugfest.</p>\n<p>The teams combined for 27 fouls in the period, and with both teams missing a boatload of threes (USF went 6-for-33 and UCSB 6-for-19), it came down to who could make the tough shots.</p>\n<p>The answer to that question was graduate transfer Leland King II, who had yet another double-double in this game with 21 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The forward led all players in scoring in and down the stretch, using his combination of length and skill to get key buckets in a short time.</p>\n<p>With about five minutes to go, he knocked in back-to-back buckets, which moved the UCSB lead up to five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos never looked back, eventually getting the seven-point victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes back home Saturday night to host the University of San Diego.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest changes that the team is looking to make is not on the court, but rather the culture and atmosphere surrounding the program off of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to build this program to have a dominant home court,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained. “We need all the students to come out and support these guys. I think they’ll be excited to see the team that we have, which includes one of the top scorers in the country (Max Heidegger is 10th in the NCAA) and Santa Barbara’s best record since 2010.”</span></p>\n<p>The Toreros are a perfect 5-0 to start off the year, and they come into the matchup led by guard Isaiah Wright, who has done a little bit of everything for San Diego so far.</p>\n<p>The Boise State transfer is averaging 14.2 points, 6 assists and 6 rebounds a game, leading his team in all three categories.</p>\n<p>The task of covering him will probably be up to Jackson and Heidegger, although the great team defense of the Gauchos will make sure that Wright sees a lot of long bodies coming his way throughout the game.</p>\n<p>If UCSB stays composed on offense and communicates well on defense, it could have a good chance of ending yet another win streak.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 30, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

In the case of Gaucho alumnus Mike Heid, class of 1995 graduate, his affinity for UCSB men’s soccer has formed a community between both current and incoming Gaucho sports fans and veterans that have been around for decades.</p>\n<p>Heid is the creator of <em>gauchosoccer.com</em>, a blog with ties to nearly any and all things related to UCSB men’s soccer.</p>\n<p>According to the website’s archives tab, information on the site dates back as early as Sept. 2016.</p>\n<p>Insight on current and former Gauchos that are now playing at either the MLS or international pro levels, the program’s 2018 recruiting class and even the formations and plays the team ran while on the field are all available on Heid’s site.</p>\n<p>Although intriguing, the website’s most striking piece of content is Heid’s self-titled “How I Procured My Own UCSB Soccer Jersey: A Case Study in Citizen Journalism.”</p>\n<p>With little to lose as an avid UCSB men’s soccer fan looking to further support his alum, Heid took his right to citizen journalism beyond the keyboard and into public records to satisfy his need for a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Despite being home to 20 Division-I sports programs, UCSB is not necessarily a sports powerhouse.</p>\n<p>With that said, the search for a team jersey in any sport is a likely afterthought for many, but not all.</p>\n<p>While browsing <em>ucsbgauchos.com</em>, one would likely come across the athletics department’s “UCSB shop” tab and would eventually find their way onto its Gauchos Shop.<br>\nCategorized under the site’s “men’s jersey” tab, the only available jerseys for purchase are for baseball and men’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Published on Nov. 4, Heid’s article chronicles his search to purchase a UCSB men’s soccer jersey, a seven-month process that began in April of this year.</p>\n<p>Trailblazing Heid’s investigation was a question about the availability of purchasing a men’s soccer jersey on the UCSB sub-Reddit a while back, influencing him to exhaust all of his possible resources in hopes of finding an answer.</p>\n<p>“For years, I’ve wanted to buy UCSB soccer jerseys. Every year I go to the Gaucho shop and jersey section, and every year it’s the same stuff. There was one year when they did sell the actual jersey, which I still have, but [nothing else since].”</p>\n<p>One of his first steps was reaching out to staff within the UCSB athletics department.</p>\n<p>His exchange of emails primarily took place with Richard Loza, director of Marketing, Branding and Sales and Bryan Cornet, the department’s assistant athletics director of Sales and External Relations.</p>\n<p>In an email sent to Cornet, Heid even offered to put up his own money for the UCSB athletics department to use in hopes of them buying the jerseys and putting them up for sale.</p>\n<p>He proposed the idea that if the jerseys didn’t bring in any revenue, he would accept the loss and not get his money back. If the jerseys were to sell, he would make his money back and the department would keep the profit.</p>\n<p>Due to university regulations, the school was unable to accept the offer. But it wasn’t this fact alone that prompted Heid to continue his investigation.</p>\n<p>Rather, it was the estimated costs to produce the jerseys that seemed most contradictory. With Nike as the university’s sponsor at the time, prior to changing to Adidas, Heid was informed that the athletics department ordered “custom” jerseys that cost around $180 a piece.</p>\n<p>For any sports fan, the only merchandise that likely hits that market price or higher is an authentic NBA Hardwood Classics jersey, a pair of retro Michael Jordan sneakers or some other form of ultra-vintage memorabilia.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the price just didn’t add up.</p>\n<p>As expected, the $180 price tag suggested definitely caught Heid off guard, considering his history as a consumer of both authentic and replica soccer jerseys.</p>\n<p>The price, paired with dwindling communication with the athletics department, led to Heid filing a public records request to verify the information he had been given about the production of the jerseys.</p>\n<p>His request was to receive information about the men’s soccer program’s purchases from the past three years, in addition to the contract UCSB Athletics had with Nike.</p>\n<p>Once his request was fulfilled and the invoices were delivered, the claim that the jerseys cost $180 was quickly disproven as UCSB was actually paying $30-40 for each jersey, which was a discounted cost nearly half the retail price.</p>\n<p>Considering UCSB’s switch from Nike to Adidas, Heid ended up filing another public records request regarding the team’s costs for jerseys by the new sponsor.</p>\n<p>From May 31 throughout August, Heid was left empty-handed with no records as he was told that there were no invoices or receipts for jerseys under the new partnership.</p>\n<p>“I made two separate requests. For my second request, I had to do about 10 follow-ups,” he said. “I don’t think Athletics was necessarily caught off guard that I was up to something and maybe verifying what they had told me. Maybe they were caught off guard with what I did with the info. But I also didn’t want the whole thing to turn adversarial. I was a little afraid that I would ostracize myself from the process.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until Aug. 29 when Heid received order confirmation documents for both the team’s home and away jerseys. But the documentation only went so far, as Heid ended up reaching out to Adidas and eventually was put in touch with a retail vendor.</p>\n<p>Communication with Adidas was the peak of Heid’s investigation. Similar to the Nike partnership, UCSB’s new deal with Adidas also consisted of jersey prices being within the $40 range and served as the deciding factor for him purchasing a wholesale amount of blue and white jerseys on Sept. 21. He received his order on Nov. 3.</p>\n<p>With the promise that he was willing to donate to UCSB, he bought a total of 64 authentic UCSB men’s soccer jerseys, spending a total amount of $2,958.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79951\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2110208514\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79946\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79951\" data-attachment-id=\"79951\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/the-secret-life-of-jerseys-an-alums-quest-to-rep-ucsb-mens-soccer/jersey-story-receipt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"805,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jersey story receipt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=197%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79951\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt-805x1024.jpg?resize=450%2C572\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?w=805&amp;ssl=1 805w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?resize=197%2C250&amp;ssl=1 197w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?resize=768%2C977&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79951\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Receipt courtesy of Mike Heid</p></div>\n<p>With UCSB Athletics uninterested in selling the jerseys and Heid’s cautiousness for trademark violations, he ended up giving them away to former players and fans that held UCSB soccer dear to their hearts similar to him.</p>\n<p>Although Heid was able to confirm his skepticism about the production costs of the jersey, his agenda wasn’t to one up the athletics department and prove them wrong.</p>\n<p>Instead, the former Gaucho is one of many that truly love the UCSB men’s soccer program and created an investigation that was dedicated to further connecting the team to its supporters.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about athletics making money from [the jerseys],” Heid said. “It’s also about the fans getting what they want and the program getting more visibility.

Racioppi didn’t let another ball past her for the remainder of the tournament, which saw the Gauchos top Ohio, Vermont, Cal Poly, Penn State and Texas in succession.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, UCSB’s easiest wins were its last two. The Gauchos blew out the Nittany Lions 4-0 in the semifinal and hung a 3-0 shutout on the Longhorns in the tournament final.</p>\n<p>A dominant defense was the common thread between this year’s championship team and last year’s side.</p>\n<p>UCSB surrendered only one goal in the 2016 tournament, which saw the Gauchos defeat UNC in a 1-0 thriller for the title.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s club soccer success goes beyond just the last two seasons. No other team has more than three national titles in the last 11 years. The Gauchos have seven.</p>\n<p>“One of the traditions we like to talk about is our success on the field and what we bring to each game,” Head Coach Todd Heil said. “Back-to-back is great and seven is pretty impressive, but year in and year out we’ve just been very fortunate to have a great group of girls.”</p>\n<p>Such dominance is only possible through passion and commitment on the part of everyone involved in the club soccer program. That starts with the players, naturally.</p>\n<p>“With the club sports mentality, it’s a group of girls that just truly want to be there and want to play the game,” Heil said. “They’re there on their own behest; they’re not there on scholarship. They are what some might call the true student-athletes, and when it clicks and they just want to all be there together, that’s even more special.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the players contribute more to the program than just their on-field performance. They’re the front-line recruiters for the team as well, manning booths and getting the word out in order to bolster the roster each year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of [the recruitment] is on the returning player,” Heil said. “Basically, you’re [creating] the path. If it’s not social media, then you’re working a table at Spring Insight. You’re just trying to get the word out once students actually become students of UCSB.”<br>\nOnce the recruitment work has been done and the season has actually started, things don’t get any easier for the club players.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s soccer club team practices three times a week rather than six times like the Division I team, but it has to balance those practices against a full schedule of academics and extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p>“Our weeks are so busy that the weekends would be a great time to get school work done, but during fall these weekends are filled with games,” Club President Ann Marie Mansholt, a four-year player, said. “This just means that time management is crucial, and we somehow get it done, whether it’s studying on a plane or in the lobbies of our hotels.”<br>\nThe club season starts right alongside school in late September and wastes no time in getting going.</p>\n<p>“We get going the first week of school,” Heil said. “We have regionals the fourth week of school and nationals is basically right around that seventh week of school. That’s cramming in a lot. You’re playing about 15 soccer games pretty quickly.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79948\" style=\"width: 372px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2028394936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79945\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79948\" data-attachment-id=\"79948\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/wcsoccer_pic2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WCSoccer_Pic2 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79948\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=362%2C482\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of Jordan Burke</em></p></div>\n<p>It’s a lot to ask not only from the players but from the coaches as well. Heil is the boys’ soccer coach at Santa Barbara High School as well as a club soccer coach, but he manages to balance his responsibilities and keep the team running smoothly.</p>\n<p>“The continuous success starts with our coach, Todd Heil,” Mansholt said. “He has been the coach since the start of this club about 18 years ago. He has built this program from the bottom up and has given this program consistent leadership.”</p>\n<p>While the club team may not get as much academic and structural support from the university as the Division I team does, that doesn’t mean it is on its own. Both Heil and Mansholt made sure to credit the Recreational Sports program for its support of their team and all other club squads.</p>\n<p>As a senior, Mansholt is going out on top. It’s an emotional experience, but she’ll be leaving behind a program with a deep tradition of success and a bright future.</p>\n<p>“I believe this team can continue success into the future by keeping the close bonds we have formed and keeping true to our style of soccer,” she said. “Now that this younger group has a taste of winning back-to-back national championships, I believe they will keep working harder than ever to win another one and keep having a blast while doing so.”</p>\n<p>That ethos of success and hard work balanced with fun is what makes the UCSB women’s club soccer team, and all club sports, special. They might not get the glory of a Division I team, but they’re student-athletes all the same.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 30</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79945\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79945\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/","id":1364,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[1363,1362,1361],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":41,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
