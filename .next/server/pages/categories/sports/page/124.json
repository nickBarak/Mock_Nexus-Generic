If you really love it, the stepping stones working towards it are just as rewarding as getting to do it and ending up with that as your job.”  — Taylor Swift</p>\n<p>What does Taylor Swift have to do with sports, the Daily Nexus or my time at UCSB? Technically nothing. In fact, on a scale from one to 10, their correlation would probably be a negative two.</p>\n<p>Yet, this quote perfectly describes my four years with this paper and my two years as the Sports Editor because the fact is, most people search for a lifetime to find a job they love. I was lucky enough to discover my passion for sports journalism at 14. I took my love for writing and abnormally large passion for sports and squished them together. It stuck, and I’ve never looked back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At UCSB, it’s only continued to grow. These four years have flown by and now, after studying for more hours than I’d like to count, writing hundreds of articles, spending dozens of late nights/new days in the Nexus office and having countless laughs, I formally say goodbye to the school (and that wonderful beach less than 10 minutes from my doorstep) I love so much.</p>\n<p>SB has truly become my home. My time in Santa Barbara and with the Nexus has only been a part of my journey, but what a journey it’s been.</p>\n<p>In my time here with the Nexus, I’ve written the season of our men’s soccer team that at one point was No. 2 in the nation. I wrote the track season in 2012 when we had athletes make it to Olympic Trials. I’ve done a one-on-one interview with three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings. I’ve sat courtside in the Honda Center not once, but twice, to watch our women’s basketball team in the Big West Playoffs, including watching the team win the title in 2012. I’ve won a CCMA award for a column I wrote on Title IX. And most recently, this year, I received the opportunity to interview the Sacramento Kings, my hometown team, during training camp here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>My experience with the Nexus has truly exceeded anything I could ever imagine and I am truly honored to have brought you your sports coverage every day.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, while I’m going to leave the philosophical stuff to my co-editor, I do have two pieces of advice for you all.</p>\n<p>It may be cliché, but find something you love and never let anyone tell you that you can’t or that you’re not good enough. I tell people all the time I would pay others to do my job. It’s one of the best feelings in the world.<br>\nThe second is to enjoy the sports here. No, we’re not a part of the Pac-12 and we don’t have an elite football team, but we have some fantastic teams here on campus. Give them a shot.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have some major thank yous to give out. First, thank you to my friends and family for your support and always reading my articles when I tell you to. Thank you to the athletic department for not only your verbal, but financial support. Thanks to every coach and athlete I’ve ever interviewed. I know I’m just a pain for you guys a lot of the time, but I really do enjoy and appreciate your time. Thank you to the 2011 softball team, my first ever team with the Nexus, for making me fall in love with sports journalism all over again.</p>\n<p>A very special shout out to the women’s basketball teams the last three years. I’ve written every game covered by the Nexus during the Carlene Mitchell era and some of those moments have been my favorite during my time here. Of course, a very big thank you to Coach Mitch. You’re the coach I’ve most gotten to know on campus and I’ve loved every second talking with you and getting to pick your brain about women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my staff, especially my co-editor PMO (we’ve made the best team), for putting up with my perfectionistic ways deep into the night. And most importantly, to the readers — you are the reason we’ve been the No. 9 newspaper the last two years. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Because I hate goodbyes, I’m simply going to say see you later, UCSB.<br>\nLove,</p>\n<p>Kristen</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/","id":2067,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2066,2065,2064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From NorCal to SoCal: Returning  to Playoff-Caliber Teams","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kings Need To Be Aggressive During Offseason","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>From afar, it might look like the start of the “New Era” for the Sacramento Kings was completely unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>After all, Sacramento’s record this year of 28-54 was exactly equivalent to the team’s record the year before.

At times this season, it was visible. Sacramento beat excellent playoff teams such as Houston, Miami and Portland. However, the Kings lacked consistency, especially on defense, falling to some of worst teams in the NBA.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest positives to take away from this season is that the front office proved it is willing to do whatever it takes to make the team good now. General Manager Pete D’Alessandro made great strides with Rudy Gay early in the season, giving Kings a “Big Three” of their own in Gay, point guard Isaiah Thomas and center DeMarcus Cousins.</p>\n<p>Looking to next season, the biggest need is to ensure all the big pieces to the current squad stay intact, unless the Kings can trade or sign a franchise-changing player. But it needs to be a player who management has great faith will stay in Sacramento. There’s talk of trying to trade for All-Star Kevin Love, but it’s risky to sign a player that could pack up and move a year after signing when his contract expires.</p>\n<p>Thomas is a restricted free agent during the offseason. There’s currently talk of trading Thomas, but the young underdog has proved he can hold his own in this league and be a great point guard.</p>\n<p>Last season, Thomas averaged 20.3 points, 6.3 assists and 2.9 rebounds per game. Obtaining another point guard would be smart, but having the ball in Thomas’ hands led to nothing but good things last season. Don’t mess with it now.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Gay also can become an unrestricted free agent if he decides not to exercise his player option worth $19.3 million for the 2014-15 season. Gay had the best year of his career with California’s capital city, setting career-highs in points per game, field goal percentage and assists per game. His ability to score at the small forward position and his versatility greatly aided the Kings. Keep him in purple and black too.</p>\n<p>As for the last member of the Big Three, Cousins needs to mature, and fast. The Kings need him on the court, not in foul trouble or being suspended for technical fouls. He led the NBA in ‘T’s’ again this season.</p>\n<p>Cousins has the talent and frame to be a franchise player. He was great this year, improving his efficiency on the offensive end, but if he can mentally become strong to the point where he’s not committing silly turnovers and taking possessions off on defense, he could easily be an all-star next season. It’s time for him to step up and lead by example.</p>\n<p>The biggest area of need for the Kings in the offseason is at the shooting guard position. Rookie Ben McLemore simply isn’t ready. This season, he showed he has bad hands; he needs great improvement with his ball handling and he’s not the shooter anyone expected him to be.</p>\n<p>In an overall disappointing season for McLemore, the Kings traded Marcus Thornton, showing the Kings want McLemore to be a big part of their future. With drastic improvement, maybe he could be, but not now.<br>\nThe Kings didn’t have the greatest luck in the lottery, receiving the No. 8 pick, but Sacramento was the first to put that pick up for a trade in order to ensure immediate talent and success. It’s certainly the smartest tactic for the organization right now.</p>\n<p>Sacramento is in need of consistent perimeter shooting. A good passer would be favorable.

Carter throws a fastball that clocks in as high as early 90’s MPH and can control the strike zone.</p>\n<p>Clements went a combined 20-2 his last two years in high school and comes in with an above average changeup, coupled with excellent command of the strike zone.</p>\n<p>“[Clements’] won a ton of games, struck out a lot of hitters, pounds the strike zone,” Checketts said. “He has the ability to be a starter … He can come in and do something immediately.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has power lined up in the form of 6’5’’, 240-pound first baseman Austin Bush. The left-handed batter will need to work on decreasing his hit-or-miss approach at the plate, but the slugger’s frame can provide a homerun threat in the middle of the lineup for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Power is really hard to find in college baseball, there’s just not a lot of guys that hit two words,” says Checketts. “He’s athletic and can feel his position for a big guy. He’s got a chance to come in to compete for the first base job immediately.”</p>\n<p>Another player with the same frame as Bush is right-handed pitcher Austyn Willis out of Barstow High. The speed on his fastball can reach the upper 80’s. In his final year in high school, Willis made 11 appearances and had a 2.85 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also recruited from within Santa Barbara with the addition of Santa Barbara City College’s Patrick O’Brien. In 35 games played for SBCC, the catcher hit .299 and had 27 runs to go along with 13 RBI. With current starting catcher Jackson Morrow set to graduate, O’Brien’s experience puts him in position to start right away and fill the hole left by Morrow.</p>\n<p>Shane Mardirosian from Martin Luther King High School in Riverside is another potential player for UCSB. The infielder’s elite speed and bat speed makes him a lock to get drafted, says Checketts. Depending how high Mardirosian gets selected will decide if he plays for the Gauchos come next season.</p>\n<p>As of now, the Gauchos are saying goodbye to four seniors from this year’s team, including left fielder Joey Epperson, who has arguably been the best hitter in the lineup for UCSB this season. However, the team has built a strong recruiting class that could contribute to a Big West title next year for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/","id":4434,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4433,4432,4431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Four Freshmen Set to Take Spotlight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-02.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-02.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB finished just one win shy of taking the Big West title this season.

UCSB will, however, need to fill the shoes of two starters: All-Big West first team member Kathryn Pilpil and All-Big West honorable mention selection Lauren Boser.</p>\n<p>“They stepped up this year and stepped into leadership roles. They created an atmosphere where this team could perform and could focus on the right things,” Galicinao said. “The way this group came together and played for each other, I’ve been here for nine years and this year was definitely special and different.”</p>\n<p>To fill the voids and hopefully create an even better team for next season, Galicinao brings in four recruits to Santa Barbara next season.</p>\n<p>The first is Jessica Johnston from Studio City, CA.  Johnston is a lefty outfielder who was the captain of her squad at Harvard-Westlake High School.</p>\n<p>In her senior year, Johnston batted .474 and tallied nine doubles. In addition, during her three years on the varsity squad, she recorded a .464 on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re always trying to bring in well-rounded athletes,” Galicinao said. “[Jessica] hits from the left side and hits for power. She has a good arm as well.”</p>\n<p>Coming to Santa Barbara from Norwalk, CA, Samantha Lujan has the potential to play catcher or the corners for UCSB. In her first three years at Norwalk High School, Lujan owned a .358 batting average and a .403 on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ third incoming freshman next season is a right-handed pitcher, Lena Mayer. Originally from Berkeley, CA, Mayer earned a 1.74 ERA her senior year at Berkeley High School. Offensively, she held a .427 batting average during her four years, including a .438 average her senior year, while holding a .526 on-base percentage in her final season.</p>\n<p>“We have a pitcher coming in who has good velocity and throws the down ball,” Galicinao said. “She’s similar to [senior Andriana Collins], except AC is left-handed.”</p>\n<p>The final recruit for Santa Barbara for 2014 is utility Kayla Sisson, who was ranked the sixth-best high school player in Nevada. Coming to Santa Barbara from Tahoe City, CA, Sisson played with the Lady Magic travel team in Sacramento.

This season, UCSB ranked toward the top in nearly every offensive category.</p>\n<p>“There were some games (this year) where we were shut down and I think there will be less of those because a lot of our high performers are going to be back,” Galicinao said. “They’re going to be older and they’ll be stronger.

The Cavaliers have now won the number one overall pick two years in a row and in three out of the last four years. On top of that, they had the fourth pick in both 2011 and 2012. To put it simply, if the Cavs start the player that they get in this year’s draft, their entire first unit would be made up of top-five athletes.</p>\n<p>So, besides the rest of the NBA being bent over from this lottery outcome, what does this pick mean? It means the Cavs have another chance to either grab a good player like Kyrie Irving, or completely embarrass themselves again.</p>\n<p>I’m sure we all remember the players they passed up in recent years such as Damian Lillard, Andre Drummond, Kemba Walker and Klay Thompson, just to name a few. Instead, the team lucked out and drafted the incredible Tristan Thompson and amazing Anthony Bennett. Along with those great moves, they signed/dropped Andrew Bynum and traded big for Luol Deng, who is now a free agent. All while failing to make theplayoffs since King James left.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lucky enough for the Cavs, this draft is possibly more stacked than the 2003 draft which consisted of Miami’s big three and Carmelo Anthony. What this means is that if Cleveland decides to keep its pick, it will be pretty hard to take another bust with all these promising young players to choose from.</p>\n<p>Everyone from random enthusiasts to big time analysts are saying that the number one overall pick in this draft will be Kansas’s Andrew Wiggins, but in my opinion, that’s their third best option.</p>\n<p>Wiggins is a good player without a doubt, but his subpar college performance showed his youth and inexperience at the next level. In addition to that, he isn’t the greatest fit into the system of the Cavaliers, especially if Deng were to stay.</p>\n<p>The team’s second best option would be to take Joel Embiid or Jabari Parker. The Cavs struggle at both the SF and C positions on both sides of the ball. Parker would help offensively, which the team needs as it was 22nd in scoring last year, but he could be a burden on defense.</p>\n<p>Embiid could prove to be a huge help on defense as long as the seven-footer works on his speed a bit. He averaged 2.6 blocks last year and played excellent post defense to go with it. Joel is the best pick for the Cavs if they decide to draft, but trading this pick would truly be the most effective.</p>\n<p>Minnesota knows Kevin Love is leaving next year and they’re looking for a deal. The Cavs could consider bundling the pick and possibly Dion Waiters to bring in K-Love, which would surely draw Deng back in as well. Kyrie, Deng, Love, and two top picks sound good to me. Maybe that will break the King James curse.</p>\n<p>Now, it is annoying that Cleveland received the top pick again, but with the talent in this draft, other teams shouldn’t hang their heads by any means. In fact, the team that should be the most excited is the Philadelphia 76ers, who have the third pick.</p>\n<p>With the two Jayhawks probably going first, Philly will likely have the option of Coach K’s Jabari Parker, who can easily complement the team. He would join reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams (another player whom Cleveland passed up) and Nerlens Noel, who will make his real debut this year. This young combination will ensure they never have another terrible slide like they did in the second half of last season.</p>\n<p>Another pair of teams that can strive if they play their cards right are the Lakers and Celtics. These two rivals can work together to make a blockbuster trade with their 6th and 7th picks. The Celtics could help build their franchise by adding a veteran in like Kevin Love in exchange for their pick as well as dish Rajon Rondo to the Lakers for their pick.</p>\n<p>The Celtics would receive an all-star and likely draft Marcus Smart and the Lakers would receive Rondo who helps them in their “win now” situation. With Kobe being re-signed, it’s clear they aren’t trying to build with an incoming rookie. If neither team were to trade, they could still be looking at drafting Aaron Gordon, Julius Randle and Smart, who would best fit both teams.</p>\n<p>The team that undoubtedly got burned the most was the Detroit Pistons. In a trade with the Bobcats a few years ago, Detroit received a minimally protected first round pick in this year’s draft. This meant that if the Pistons got a top-eight pick, they could keep it for themselves, and if they didn’t, it would belong to Charlotte. The Pistons received the 9th pick on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>This draft will definitely be one for the league to remember and although things may seem bad for your team now, don’t worry yourself in the slightest. This is the NBA Draft — we never know what insanity is going to unfold.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of </em>www.sportslogos.net<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/","id":523,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[522,521,520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season On The Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_Brock2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_Brock2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Plays in Its Final Regular Season Series Against UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Beginning today, the UCSB baseball team will cap off its 2014 regular season campaign when it goes on the road to face UC Davis in a must-win series.

UCSB will have to sneak its way in by earning an at-large berth where the selection committee will decide UCSB’s season based on factors such as the team’s strength of schedule and wins against top opponents.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on the process of playing good baseball,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We got away from that; we looked at the scoreboard standings more than we should have.”</p>\n<p>For teams on the bubble such as the Gauchos, earning an RPI that lands within the top 45 in the nation increases the likelihood of the team qualifying.  As of now, UCSB has an RPI of 57, six spots ahead of where it was last week.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, however, is familiar with late-season pressure. Last year, the Gauchos were in a similar circumstance and needed to sweep their final series to earn a spot in the field. UCSB did just that and found a spot in the postseason for the first time since 2001. Yet, that team finished 17-10 in conference while this year’s squad can best hope for an even Big West mark with a sweep.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need everything to go its way against the Aggies, beginning with starting pitching. In its last two weekend series, Santa Barbara has found success with sophomore Justin Jacome and junior Austin Pettibone on the mound.</p>\n<p>In Jacome’s last two starts he has allowed only two earned runs and increased his innings pitched to 72.1 on the season, the most on the staff. Meanwhile, Pettibone has been even more dominant than Jacome in his last two outings. The ace of the staff has thrown two complete-game shutouts, striking out a combined 15 batters and allowing only nine hits.</p>\n<p>Where the Gauchos have struggled recently is finding a quality third starting pitcher to throw in the third game of the series. On the last two occasions, UCSB has failed to win Sunday games when taking the first two games. Those losses have consisted of the Gauchos struggling to recover from early deficits caused by a lack of quality pitching.</p>\n<p>While the starters will dictate the early-to-mid innings of the game, the bullpen will be just as valuable to secure wins in late-game situations. Sophomore closer Dillon Tate has been UCSB’s go-to pitcher during crunch time. Tate has 11 saves on the season, second in the Big West, and leads the conference with a 0.87 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I just kept working every day,” Tate said. “I was just trying to get better and do something that would benefit me and help my team out.”</p>\n<p>On paper, the Gauchos seem to overwhelm the Aggies on offense, given that UCD has the worst ERA in the league at 4.46. As a staff, Davis has given up the most earned runs and walks in the Big West, with 218 and 211, respectively. With Santa Barbara hitting a collective .286, the team will attempt to get on the board fast.</p>\n<p>First pitch today is scheduled for 2:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55467\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55467\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/","id":4152,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4151,4150,4149],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Add Depth With Three Recruits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensBasketballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensBasketballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=962%2C641&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team aims at taking the Big West next season with a trio of new recruits.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team finished this past season with an impressive second-place finish in the Big West Conference and the reigning conference Player of the Year in rising junior center Alan Williams.

Last season at Mt. San Jacinto, Smith led his team to the quarterfinals of the California Community College State Tournament while averaging 14 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“My staff had watched him play and we just decided that we wanted to add a little bit more depth at the guard position,” Coach Williams said. “I’m very excited to add more physical, quick, aggressive, pressure type defenders to a team that I do believe is going to have the ability to be very good defensively.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the team’s depth at guard is 6’2” combo guard Gabe Vincent out of Stockton, CA. Vincent attended St. Mary’s High School and played at the highest level of AAU basketball in the state for the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very well-rounded complete guard that doesn’t really have a weakness, particularly out of high school,” Coach Williams said. “He does everything well. He’s a very good defender, very good rebounder, very good shooter and passer. He really has an extremely well balanced game.”</p>\n<p>Vincent is expected to contribute right away as a shooting guard, but has the skill set to play both the point guard and shooting guard positions.</p>\n<p>“Vincent and Smith will play right away. They’re both very ready physically to contribute. They’re strong, they’re tough, they defend,” Coach Williams said. “They’re not going to be intimidated, neither one of them, and they’re both going to be really good additions.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class is Justin Burks, a 6’6” forward out of Nevada. Burks attended Las Vegas’ Arbor View High School and also played at the highest level of AAU basketball for the Las Vegas Prospects.</p>\n<p>“He adds to the John Green-Michael Bryson type category. He’s versatile, longer, taller,” Coach Williams said. “He’s going to have to get a lot more physical and stronger but his upside is very good.”</p>\n<p>While Burks figures to need more time to adjust to the college game in comparison to Vincent and Smith, he adds versatility and the ability to play and defend the two, three and four positions on the floor.</p>\n<p>“He has a really good mid-range game, and he’s really good off the dribble getting into the paint,” Coach Williams said. “He’s pretty active chasing rebounds. Those things add a lot to us.”</p>\n<p>The three newcomers join a talented and veteran group of players headlined by Williams. Big Al led the Big West in points and rebounds per game, while ranking 12th in the nation in scoring and second nationally in rebounding.</p>\n<p>“Most everybody that’s coming here is excited playing with a guy of Al’s caliber,” Coach Williams said. We think it’s a great thing that we’re adding the pieces to play around a great player.”</p>\n<p>Rising junior guard Michael Bryson played second fiddle to Big Al last season, finishing second on the team in scoring while garnering Big West Honorable Mention. Bryson figures to start at either the shooting guard or small forward position next season.</p>\n<p>Point guard play looks to be a source of strength for the Gauchos next season, thanks in large part to rising senior Zalmico Harmon. Harmon finished last season with the second best assist-to-turnover ratio in the entire nation and finished the year with Big West Honorable Mention accolades.</p>\n<p>“We’re hopeful that Z makes as big as a jump between his junior and senior year as he did during his junior year,” Coach Williams said. “We thought he got way better as the year went on. We feel like he has a whole other level he can go to as his comfort zone in the program rises.”</p>\n<p>Also playing point will be sophomore Eric Childress and junior T.J. Taylor. Childress finished his freshman year with spectacular consistency towards the end of the season, while Taylor is a two-year starter who missed last season with a hip injury.</p>\n<p>Smith will certainly compete for point guard playing time with the trio and Vincent could even work his way into the conversation by the end of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that [Smith] would play that position over them, he’d play with them, which allows you to have two point guards on the floor like I did with Eric and Z,” Coach Williams said. “Now we’ll have five guys in the program that are very good with the ball and very good off the bounce.”</p>\n<p>The rest of UCSB’s rotation will consist of rising junior forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler, redshirt freshman forward Alex Hart and junior guard John Green. Brewe started much of the year at power forward for the Gauchos last season while Beeler provided solid backup minutes at both the four and five spots.</p>\n<p>Hart redshirted last season but brings a versatile ability to shoot the ball from outside in addition to his 6’10” frame. Green has lost most of his career to injury but has the potential to add another deadly scorer and physical presence to UCSB if he can stay healthy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 20, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55443\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55443\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/","id":527,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[526,525,524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miami Trails Elite Dynasties of the NBA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nexus sports editor Kristen Henneman discusses the Heat's place in NBA history.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the sports world today, the worth of any player or team is based upon how many championships they own.</p>\n<p>Personal accolades and regular season awards are great, but if you can’t win rings, you can forget being considered in the conversation for the best of all time.</p>\n<p>Currently fighting to stand on the list for best franchises of all time is the Miami Heat.

More recently, Los Angeles won three-straight titles in 2000-02 behind one of the best duos in NBA history in Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Bulls have also known the glory of the three-peat twice, accomplishing it in 1991-93 and 1996-98. Chicago, of course, was led by arguably the best player to ever play the game of basketball, Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>The team standing above all however, is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics utterly dominated the basketball world in the sixties, winning eight championships in a row and 11 in 13 years from 1957-69. The master behind the success? A 6’10’’ center by the name of Bill Russell.</p>\n<p>Russell, who is underrated when it comes to listing the best players of all time, holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls, the Heat features one of the best players to ever grace a basketball court and certainly the best player currently playing the game right now: LeBron James. Miami also features the “Big Three” in James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, which has captivated audiences all over the world.</p>\n<p>The Heat’s fast-paced, flashy play and incredible talent make them one of the most entertaining teams of all time if nothing else. They also play at a time where the level of competition around the league is much higher (excluding the Eastern Conference this season).</p>\n<p>Every year now, there are a handful of teams fighting for the NBA Championship rather than just a couple teams that were powerhouses decades ago. It does make the idea of a three-peat seem even more remarkable.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when it all comes down to it, it’s all about the rings. Boston leads the NBA in championships with an incredible 17 titles. The Lakers don’t rank far behind with 16.</p>\n<p>Considering that a sports dynasty is defined as “a team that dominates its sport or league for an extraordinary length of time,” these are the two teams that should be considered dynasties.</p>\n<p>They’re always in the hunt and rarely have off years. They’re the teams everyone wants to be a part of because there’s always a good chance to make history.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Lakers and Celtics are the best teams in NBA history. Period.</p>\n<p>With that said, Chicago would have to come next on the list for ranking of the best team with six crowns, all coming in the electrifying era that was Jordan.</p>\n<p>The Jordan Era made Chicago a destination for great players and a city that desired greatness in the basketball world. Nevertheless, the Bulls are still looking for that next group to bring home more rings and give the Bulls multiple eras of greatness.</p>\n<p>As for Miami, which currently owns three championships, another title would bring the Heat’s total to four, tying it for fourth-most crowns in NBA history with San Antonio.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Miami will go down as one of the most elite franchises in the NBA if it can three-peat in June, but four franchise championships is a long way off from 17, 16 or even six crowns.<br>\nAnd considering that the number of championships determines your worth, the Heat still have a long way to go if it wants to move up in the ranking for best team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/","id":526,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[525,524,523],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Heat Superstar-Trio Still Has Lots to Prove","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Mark Salay discusses why the Heat don't measure up with the NBA's greatest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Eight wins.

With three titles, that puts them in the same playing field as Kobe and Shaq’s Lakers, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker’s Spurs and Larry Bird’s great Celtics teams. Those teams won three titles each.</p>\n<p>However, for the Heat to enter the upper echelon of dynasties would mean equating them with teams that revolutionized the game. Bill Russell’s Celtics, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Lakers and Michael Jordan’s Bulls all fall under this elite category. The Minneapolis Lakers of the early 1950s led by George Mikan also deserves a spot in this class.</p>\n<p>Consider that these teams all won at least four titles, played against formidable competition and dominated the game.</p>\n<p>Jordan three-peated twice and if he hadn’t decided to take a two-year break from the game, the Bulls would most likely have won eight straight titles.</p>\n<p>Not only did Chicago win each time they reached the Finals, none of the series were pushed to a game seven. LeBron and Co. lost in their first appearance and if it wasn’t for an incredibly clutch three-point shot from</p>\n<p>Ray Allen, last year’s Finals wouldn’t even have gone to a deciding game seven.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the topic of who Miami has faced in the championship round. In 2012, the Heat played against a young and inexperienced Oklahoma City squad that was not ready to take the crown just yet.</p>\n<p>Last year, a game seven proved to be too much for an aging Spurs team. Going against Kevin Durant before this year or Duncan past his prime does not cut it when talking about all-time great dynasties.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Showtime Lakers had to go through the legendary Celtics teams led by Bird. Those games pitted two opponents who had the same caliber of talent and saved the NBA from going extinct. The</p>\n<p>Johnson-Bird rivalry increased interest of the NBA and brought a new generation of fans to the game.</p>\n<p>Russell had his own rival in Wilt Chamberlain and Jordan went toe-to-toe with the two-headed monster of Karl Malone and John Stockton twice. James is the best player in the league, but there is no equivalent for him to prove his mettle.</p>\n<p>The Heat are also not on par with the dominance achieved with teams that came before. Minneapolis, the league’s first dynasty, won five championships in six years. Boston failed to win a title just once during the 1960s. That ladies and gentlemen, is dominance. The Heat are good, but not that good.</p>\n<p>And if you had to pick one coach to draw up the last play with the game on the line, would you have Erik Spoelstra design the play, or hand things over to Red Auerbach or Phil Jackson? The championship rings on those coach’s fingers can answer that question. Auerbach won nine times and Jackson ran out of fingers to show off his rings.</p>\n<p>If the Heat win it this year they deserve to be ranked higher than other mini-dynasties such as the Houston Rockets of the mid 1990s or the Detroit Pistons of the Bad Boy era. Their name probably is on the same plateau as Bird’s Celtics and Kobe and Shaq’s L.A. teams. However, to enter legendary status and be considered the greatest, Miami will have to win, “not three, not four, not six, not seven.” Only time will tell if that happens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55447\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55447\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/","id":524,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[523,522,521],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Series At San Francisco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-13.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-13.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After going 2-1 against USF, the Gauchos clinched the program’s best non-conference win percentage in a single season by improving to 22-5-1 in non-conference games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the second consecutive weekend, the UCSB baseball team entered its series finale against the University of San Francisco with a chance to sweep, yet, after digging itself into an early deficit, the team once again failed to win its final game of the series, losing yesterday by a score of 8-4.</p>\n<p>After Sunday’s loss, the Gauchos’ record stands at 31-17-1 and 9-12 in Big West.

An error by USF scored another run for the Gauchos to extend their lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to score three more runs in the second inning by converting on its bases loaded opportunity. With a runner on each base, the Gauchos’ first run of the frame came by way of pass ball. Nesovic then followed with a bases clearing double that scored two additional runs. Santa Barbara came out of the inning leading by five runs.</p>\n<p>USF earned a run in the third inning off of sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome, but the Dons were unable to produce any big run innings in the game. San Francisco’s biggest inning came in the fifth when it scored two runs, but Jacome kept the Dons’ offense on check. In 7.2 innings of work, Jacome limited USF to just six hits and struck out four on his way to picking up his seventh win on the year, the most on the staff.</p>\n<p>UCSB scored five more times in the game, including a homerun by Quinlan in the fifth inning, his first of the season. Quinlan’s 2-5 performance from the plate was just one of the Gauchos’ many solid hitting performances on the day. Epperson had a perfect game from the batter’s box, hitting 3-3 and walking in his three other plate appearances. Nesovic had three RBI in his four-hit game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now awaits its final series of the season this weekend against conference opponent, UC Davis.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 19th, 2014th’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/","id":4433,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4432,4431,4430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Bring in One New Recruit for 2015","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Womens-tennis-v-Hawaii_03.24.2014_Kenneth-Song-6717.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Womens-tennis-v-Hawaii_03.24.2014_Kenneth-Song-6717.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the departure of two seniors, UCSB looks to improve upon this season's 8-16 record by adding one player for next year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the UCSB women’s tennis season officially at a close, the important offseason begins, with a main point of interest involving the process of recruiting.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, the recruiting this offseason has been rather unique.

She is strong, a top Californian and will appear in the top six singles position,” Thibodeau said. “Natalie will perform at a top level. We are very lucky to have recruited her. She looks to be a great student and leader for our team.”</p>\n<p>This past season, the team went 8-16 with a conference record of 4-4. The Gauchos moved to the second round of the Big West Tournament after defeating UC Davis in the first round 4-0, but the women’s season came to an end after the second round defeat by top-seeded Long Beach St. 0-4. Through its recruits, UCSB looks to become an even stronger team next year.</p>\n<p>“We like to build our team around strong Californians and then two or three out-of-state players who can add to the team as well. With these players, we can boast our team rankings, hopefully getting into the top 60 and becoming a heavy contender in the Big West Tourney,” Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>The women’s team likes to build their team around California prospects because it allows them to give more scholarships to in-state players. Out-of-state players receive substantially less of a scholarship and are therefore harder to recruit a top prospect. By recruiting Da Silveira, the Gauchos have really put themselves in a win-win situation, gaining a top Californian prospect, while allowing a larger scholarship to be rewarded.</p>\n<p>Coach Thibodeau is currently in contact with a few possible out-of-state recruits he has been observing since January. UCSB has become a top school of interest for prospects; a reputation that has really improved in the two years that Thibodeau has coached the team.</p>\n<p>“With the addition of Natalie and the out-of-state prospects, we will improve and next year we will be a stronger team than this past season,” Thibodeau said. “Our rankings have been continuously rising, and through donations we have successfully been able to raise our scholarships for future players. You could say that things are getting exciting here at UCSB for women’s tennis.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55355\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-bring-in-one-new-recruit-for-2015/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55355\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-bring-in-one-new-recruit-for-2015/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-bring-in-one-new-recruit-for-2015/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-bring-in-one-new-recruit-for-2015/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-bring-in-one-new-recruit-for-2015/","id":178,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[177,176,175],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings in New Pool of Talent","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/M1-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7668.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/M1-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7668.jpg?resize=940%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After losing only one graduating senior, the Gauchos recruit six local and foreign players to their roster for their 2015 campaign.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team is looking forward to taking over the Big West next year with its haul of recruits coming in to bolster a talented team.

He is originally from Australia, but played at Cerritos Community College for the past two seasons, compiling a 47-2 overall record, including an unbeaten 22-0 mark this season.</p>\n<p>He was the first player in nine years to win the Junior College Singles and Double State Championships in the same year. Eshmade follows star Gaucho junior Tobias Galskov as a transfer from the junior college ranks where Galskov won the Junior College State Singles Championship in 2012.</p>\n<p>“Nathan is an aggressive-style player who we hope to see big things from,” Davis said. “Transitioning from junior college to practice with our D-1 team will make him a better player, and I expect him to ‘blossom’ into a great player and have an impact on dual matches next season.”</p>\n<p>Mays is also a transfer recruit from Wake Forest University. The Malibu native returns to his home state to compete for UCSB after playing at the No. 5 and No. 6 spots his freshman year and then redshirting his sophomore year. This gives him three more years of eligibility with the Gauchos, and with his experience playing with the No. 19 Demon Deacons, Mays will hope to also play his way into the upper half of the lineup next season.</p>\n<p>“Morgan has been playing in a good program the last couple of years, and I expect him to do well for us,” said Davis. “His lack of match experience this past year might hurt him, but I feel he has something to prove and will be able to continue to develop with us.”</p>\n<p>The three incoming freshmen from Northern California are all four-star recruits. Huang played at American High School in Fremont and garnered interest from Stanford, Cal and USC.</p>\n<p>“Andy plays a big game,” Davis said. “He hits the ball hard, and I think that will translate well to D-1 tennis.”</p>\n<p>Masciorini comes from Dana Point and had a 23-12 record in high school.

They eventually finished the season with a 12-15 overall record and a 2-4 mark in Big West games.</p>\n<p>Already stacked with a multitude of young talents, this year’s recruiting class was never going to be as big as the previous year.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a huge class. We had 15 freshmen last year so we weren’t looking to add a ton of people,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We wanted to [fill] a couple of positions with a couple of talented players.”</p>\n<p>Local Santa Barbara High School student Elizabeth Hendrix is the first of the recruits.</p>\n<p>“[She’s] a great shooter and can definitely contribute to the team,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>The next is Madison Delgado out of Santiago High School.

Everyone has been good teammates and it’s been a fun, competitive year, and we’ll look for that to continue next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 15, 2014 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/","id":5067,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5066,5065,5064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Striving to End Strong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Travels North to Face San Francisco in Final Non-Conference Series  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB baseball team began the season with one of its best starts in program history.

USF came up on the losing side in each of those respective series and has won only twice in six games this year against the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need all the help it can get going into this series.</p>\n<p>After failing to defeat Pepperdine in its last game, the last opponent that could have given the Gauchos a serious résumé booster ahead of the NCAA tournament selection, UCSB must win its remaining games to have any possibility of playing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“There’s still a shot. All is not lost,” Epperson said. “We’re certainly in a really tough place right now as far as getting into the playoff picture. We would need to sweep both these next two weekends on the road.”</p>\n<p>The sense of desperation was felt in the 12-5 loss to the Waves. In that game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts resorted to using seven different pitchers and maintained a quick leash throughout the game.</p>\n<p>As early as the first inning, Checketts began experimenting with his pitching rotation after sophomore Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s two-run lead despite him throwing only 14 pitches.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB was hurt by its lack of efficiency on defense. The team committed five errors in crucial parts of the game that led to runs in what was one of its most disappointing defensive performances of the season.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of confidence in the guys and in our entire group,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately, we just didn’t win any aspect of the game: pitching, defense, offense. You’re not going to win any game when you’re not doing anything particularly well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to turn things around but faces the challenge of doing it on the road. Given the Gauchos’ struggles away from home this year, playing with an 8-10 road record, the team will need to get on the board early and take advantage of scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>However, most of the losses have come against Big West opponents. Before losing to Pepperdine, UCSB had won its previous two non-conference road games.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has had productive performances from some of its players despite not winning as of late. Junior Greg Mahle has been doing double duty on the mound and from behind the plate as designated hitter.</p>\n<p>Known this season for his reliable relief pitching, Mahle has been in the lineup in four of UCSB’s last five games and is batting .414.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the bullpen, the left-hander has an ERA of 2.15 and has pitched the second-most innings on the team with 62.2.</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris has had a breakout season for UCSB. In UCSB’s last five games, Maris batted at a .333 clip.</p>\n<p>His 2-5 hitting performance against Pepperdine was one of the bright spots for the Gauchos.

He carried two redshirts, junior opposite Matt Marsh and senior outside hitter Vaun Lennon, that will step up next season to ease the transition.</p>\n<p>“The guys we already had in the gym this year will be the ones filling the positions of the graduating seniors,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>Marsh had previously played on the team his freshman and sophomore year, but due to an injury on his hand he sat out this past season.</p>\n<p>By next year, he will be ready to make his appearance back out on the court. Lennon, on the other hand, was a transfer acquired from UC San Diego. He earned many accomplishments during his time as a Triton, one of which was being named to the UCSB Asics Invitational All-Tournament Team.</p>\n<p>Aside from redshirts, the Gauchos will also welcome an exceptionally high number of new freshmen. Of the incoming players, McLaughlin mentioned that all were exceptional but pointed out three in particular.</p>\n<p>First is Shane Hauschild, a player who has received attention from both the men’s volleyball and water polo teams. Hauschild was recruited to UCSB on scholarship to play water polo, but will also play on the volleyball team as confirmed by McLaughlin.</p>\n<p>Hauschild comes to UCSB from San Marcos High School in Santa Barbara, where he recently led his team to a conference title.</p>\n<p>Another new addition to the team is 6’8” middle blocker Connor Drake from Loomis, California. Drake will replace current 6’9” senior middle blocker Thompson.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Gauchos welcome outside hitter Hayden Boehle from Loyola High School in Pasadena, California. Boehle is the younger brother of freshman libero Parker Boehle.</p>\n<p>Although filling the gaps of four starters seems dramatic, McLaughlin is prepared to take the progress his team made this year and grow from it in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>This year, the team made its deepest run in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament since 2011.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos made it all the way to the seminfinals after a close win over No. 9 UCLA, before they were swept by eventual MPSF champions BYU.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB ended with the No. 5 ranking in the nation this past season.</p>\n<p>“I think we are going to be better than we were this year,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 15, 2014 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/volleyball-adds-eight-recruits-next-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/volleyball-adds-eight-recruits-next-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/volleyball-adds-eight-recruits-next-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/volleyball-adds-eight-recruits-next-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/volleyball-adds-eight-recruits-next-year/","id":5295,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5294,5293,5292],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":124,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
