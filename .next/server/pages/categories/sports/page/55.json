The Gauchos led 23-22 at one point, but just couldn’t find the last two crucial points to seal what would have been a major set victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, UCSB went into set four down 2-1, needing a win to keep the match alive. A 9-3 Flyer run to open up the set seemed to put an end to any of those hopes, but the Gauchos weren’t dead yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next 21 points, UCSB racked up 10 kills as a team and stalked Lewis relentlessly in the points column. A kill from star outside hitter Jacob Delson finally pushed the Gauchos into the lead at 17-16, and two more kills from the redshirt senior gave UCSB a 19-17 lead a few points later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as they did in set three, however, the Flyers didn’t let the Gauchos get comfortable with the lead. An ace, a couple blocks and a handful of kills propelled the Flyers right back into the lead, and a Mitch Perinar kill sealed the set and the match a little later on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s two heartbreaking set losses came after a strong second set, which saw the Gauchos notch a match-best 16 kills as a team. In a twist of what was to come, the Flyers held a commanding late lead of 18-15 in the set, but UCSB, powered by two Casey McGarry aces, roared past Lewis late to take the set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman setter McGarry had an excellent night from the service line, as the freshman setter put up a team-high three aces Saturday night. McGarry also had 29 assists, which is the most on the team for the match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delson, meanwhile, seemed to be operating at full capacity after being sidelined by an ankle injury the weekend prior. The redshirt senior led the Gauchos with 22 kills and tossed in seven digs to boot. Junior outside hitter Hayden Boehle was second on the team in kills with 13, his second-best showing in that department on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB returns to action on Monday night against visiting Harvard.

The top 10 ranked duo of junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays went on to extend their season-long undefeated streak, increasing to eight in a row, as they handed a 6-3 loss to Baylor’s redshirt sophomore Will Little and freshman Constantin Frantzen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court two went in favor of the opposition as sophomores Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm lost by a final score of 7-5. Fortunately, on court three, freshman Kristian Prior and junior Cody Rakela were able to claim the doubles advantage point for UCSB after they beat sophomore Juan Benitez and senior Max Tchoutakian at 7-6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaucho lead didn’t last long when the singles portion began to unfold. The Bears have three total nationally ranked players, who all won their sets; Benitez with two 6-3’s, Tchoutakian at a tough three-setter of 3-6 / 6-2 / 6-1 and sophomore Johannes Schretter at 6-2 / 6-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holm sparked a Santa Barbara comeback after he defeated Baylor’s sophomore Jimmy Bendeck in a close 7-5 / 6-7 / 10-8. Gaucho junior Chase Masciorini added another point to the home side’s tally after his 6-4 / 7-5 victory over Frantzen. In the end, Little secured the pair of 6-3 wins over Rakela, that granted No. 9 Baylor a win on the day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, New Mexico arrived to end their drought and upset UCSB. The beginning of the meet didn’t go in favor of the Gauchos as Mays and Freund’s eight-match undefeated streak was ended by a 7-6 score versus New Mexico’s sophomore Ricky Hernandez-Tong and redshirt senior Rodolfo Jaregui. Moreno and Holm evened out the doubles portion with a 6-4 win, but the advantage point was conceded following Rakela and Prior’s 6-1 defeat to redshirt junior Sean Baklini and junior Jorge Escutia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The singles portion was much more generous to home side Santa Barbara, thanks to Freund’s 6-1 /6-2, Holm’s pair of 6-4s and Mays’ 7-6 / 7-5 scores, bringing the overall tally to 3-1 in favor of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Mexico fought back as Hernandez-Tong bested Moreno in three sets of 3-6/ 7-6/6-2. Baklini also managed a  tough victory over Masciorini at 6-2/7-5/6-3, as the overall meet score was tied up at 3-3.

Since then, however, UCSB lost four straight until finally pulling out a 10-8 win over BYU in the first game of the series.</p>\n<p>It then proceeded to drop both games of the doubleheader on Friday as well as the final game of the series on Saturday at Larry H. Miller Field in Utah, yielding an overall 5-10 season record.</p>\n<p>Heading into this weekend, UCSB had a dominating 7-1 lead over BYU in their match-up series. Both teams were visibly having slow starts to their 2017 seasons, UCSB starting the weekend with a record of 4-7 and BYU 4-6. The Cougars had been on the road for a tough 10 consecutive games and were eagerly eyeing a win in their home opener against the Gauchos.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB got on the board first on Thursday with two runs in the top of the second and another in the third, but BYU answered in their second inning at-bats with one run, continuously producing a run per inning until they led 4-3 by the bottom of the fifth.</p>\n<p>In the top half of the sixth, the Gauchos racked up three more runs to make it 6-4 and take the lead back from the Cougars. After sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen touched home on junior third baseman Kenny Corey’s single to tie the game 4-4, BYU junior starting pitcher Maverik Buffo (1-3, 5.06 ERA) was relieved by junior lefty Rhett Parkinson (0-0, 4.50 ERA).</p>\n<p>However, this pitching change did not do much to adversely affect the Gauchos as they continued to get on base, scoring freshman center fielder Tommy Jew on a throwing error by BYU senior catcher Bronson Larsen and knocking in Corey on a sac-fly to the right from UCSB junior shortstop Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>The Cougars bats did not stay quiet with a late surge in the seventh to make it a close one-run game once again. However, they were not able to retrieve the lead from the Gauchos, who remained hot at the plate, for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The first game of Friday’s doubleheader started out optimistically for the Gauchos, who broke it wide open by putting up five runs in the top of the first. Their defense then retired the side in order in the bottom half for a successful first inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB junior starting pitcher Kyle Nelson (1-2, 5.30 ERA) gave up a two-run jack to BYU’s Larsen in the bottom of the second, and the scoreboard read 5-2 through a scoreless third and fourth innings.</p>\n<p>Nelson was pulled with one out in the bottom of the fifth after giving up another home run, a line drive doubles, and three singles that culminated into three runs for the Cougars to make it 5-5. Freshman RHP Shea Barry (0-1, 3.52 ERA) gave up one more single, allowing BYU to score another run and make it 6-5 Cougars before he retired the final two batters.</p>\n<p>UCSB urgently got a run back to tie it 6-6 in the top of the sixth. Redshirt junior catcher Dempsey Grover struck out swinging but reached first on an error from BYU freshman catcher David Clawson and scored on a triple from Fisher.</p>\n<p>Barry had a controlled one-two-three inning in the bottom half of the sixth to hold the score, but the Cougars defense had a three-up, three-down inning as well in the top of the seventh to keep the Gauchos in check. Then, in walk-off fashion, Cougars sophomore shortstop Daniel Schneemann homered to right field, tragically defeating UCSB 7-6 for BYU’s first win of the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had opportunities to capitalize throughout the game considering they left six runners on base, but their opportunities to score were cut short with the game only set to last seven innings.</p>\n<p>Matters worsened from there as UCSB carried Friday afternoon’s loss into the second game, losing in a 17-3 blowout that night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had three fielding errors, junior RHP Chris Clements (0-3, 9.42 ERA) allowed 13 runs in three innings, and freshman LHP Ben Brecht (0-0, 4.35 ERA) allowed six more in the fourth alone after relieving Clements before he finally halted BYU’s offense from getting on the board for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The only three runs scored by UCSB were a home run from Fisher in the first and two unearned runs in the eighth on an error from BYU sophomore right fielder Brock Hale.</p>\n<p>The noon finale on Saturday was another high scoring game at 14-8 to the Gauchos demise, but not as merciless as Friday’s 17-3 nightcap.</p>\n<p>Saturday mirrored the first game of Friday’s doubleheader in that UCSB came out strong in the first inning, earning four, but their defense continued to give up more runs than their bats could generate and they suffered from three more fielding errors. Gauchos junior starting pitcher Steven Ledesma (0-2, 9.20 ERA) took the loss, giving up 10 runs over four and one-third innings.</p>\n<p>In a more positive light, UCSB continues to lead the BYU series now at 8-4, and despite Friday night’s defeat, the Gauchos offense seems to be alive and active. Certainly, their defense and pitching staff, in particular, have much to improve upon if they intend to win games and get back over .500.</p>\n<p>However, it is still early in the season with a plenty of baseballs left to play, meaning there is sufficient time to recover and develop as a team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for 11 successive games starting with this weekend’s series against Stony Brook University. The Gauchos return to their home turf should give them the confident advantage they need to make progress toward a winning season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76453\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76453\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/","id":4144,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4143,4142,4141],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Nearly Have Game-Winner Sink, Suffer 56-55 Loss to LBSU in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The quest for its 15th Big West title for the UCSB women's basketball team was ended over the weekend as the Gauchos were edged in their loss to Long Beach State.

Helping steer the 49ers’ scoring was senior point guard Anna Kim with four points during the stretch.</p>\n<p>Kim finished with a team-high 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting along with four rebounds, three assists, and one steal.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s lethargic start simply stemmed from its shots not falling. Although it managed to chip away at Long Beach’s lead as the game progressed, UCSB ended shooting 35.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Scoring the first basket for UCSB was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a layup in the post. Despite outrebounding LBSU 41-28, Santa Barbara still had to counter the 49ers’ attempt to shut down the paint.</p>\n<p>Edelman recorded her ninth double-double of the season, her second of the Big West Tournament, with 14 points and tied her career-high of 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Getting down low was a challenge as UCSB went 3-of-14 from the field (21.4 percent) with Porter netting the final two scores from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Long Beach State’s defensive press was successful in disrupting UCSB’s pace on offense as the 49ers held the Gauchos scoreless for 4:36 of the final five minutes of the first quarter, allowing the Beach to take a 18-8 lead.</p>\n<p>A 10-4 run to open the second period sustained the 49ers’ double-figure lead, increasing it to 28-12 following a made jumpshot by senior guard Raven Benton to jumpstart the string of points. Benton had 12 points while going 5-of-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>With the momentum shifting in favor of Long Beach State, UCSB looked to trim its deficit after calling a timeout with 4:55 remaining before halftime.</p>\n<p>Providing the first step toward cutting the lead was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez with a long range make. On the Gauchos’ next possession, it was redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler with the defensive rebound and drive on the other end of the court for a layup that reduced UCSB’s deficit to 17-28.</p>\n<p>Another layup by Toler helped bring UCSB within a 10-point margin, but free-throws and a jumpshot by the 49ers’ Gigi Hascheff gave LBSU a 33-19 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>Giving LBSU its largest lead of 19 points was Kim with a make from behind the perimeter as the 49ers went up 38-19.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB remained focused and had a 16-2 scoring outburst that catapulted the team to possibly achieve the come from behind victory.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 36.4 percent and 25 percent from behind the three-point line in the quarter, UCSB’s defense helped to produce on the offensive side of the ball.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held Long Beach State to just nine points as the 49ers went 3-of-16 (18.8 percent) and 1-of-6 from long range (16.7 percent).</p>\n<p>“It had to start with our defense,” Henrickson said. “We were active. I think we had more deflections in a five minute stretch than we did in the whole first half. That’s who we need to be consistently. We made the run because we started to guard.”</p>\n<p>The run included a 7-of-8 performance at the free-throw line, in which Toler knocked down her pair to ignite UCSB.</p>\n<p>Uplifting the Gauchos’ spirit was a made three-pointer by Porter to finally trim LBSU’s lead to single figures at 40-31.</p>\n<p>Both a pair of made free-throws by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and a make from three-point range by Hernandez led to UCSB’s deficit being 35-40. A trip to the free-throw line for LBSU’s Benton allowed the 49ers to take a 42-35 lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to outscore the 49ers 20-14, the clutch emergence of senior forward Madison Montgomery for LBSU was pivotal to the game’s final result.</p>\n<p>Montgomery scored 10 of her 14 points in the final period, six of which came from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>But it was the best scoring quarter for UCSB who had a 63.6 field goal percentage and was able to gain a 51-49 lead with 2:27 remaining in regulation after a three-point make by Toler, who had nine of her game-high 16 points in the game’s last 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>However, responding with baskets after losing the lead twice was Montgomery with a layup and eventual three-pointer that led to a 54-53 lead for LBSU. Extending the lead to 56-53 was a layup by senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer.</p>\n<p>Two trips to the free-throw line ended with Toler making 1-of-2 attempts at the line before UCSB was in the position of having the game’s final possession while facing a 55-56 deficit.</p>\n<p>Able to draw up a play following a replay review, UCSB made sure it got the ball to its ‘go-to’ player in Porter, whose shot didn’t fall just seconds before the final play clock buzzed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/","id":530,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[529,528,527],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Pulls Off Upset Over No. 1 Seed UC Davis, Face LBSU on Saturday in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-12-at-1.15.38-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-12-at-1.15.38-PM.png?resize=804%2C470&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team continues to inch closer to claiming its 15th Big West title after defeating UC Davis.

It’s been a long road so to just have the opportunity to play in the championship is mind blowing. I never pictured we would be here, but here we are,” senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe said.</p>\n<p>Following the career performance their teammate Sarah Porter the previous night, both Jemerigbe and redshirt junior guard Drea Toler emerged as the Gauchos’ leading scorers en route to their win over the conference title favorite.</p>\n<p>The backcourt duo combined for 44 points. Jemerigbe recorded a new career-high in points with 21. Toler’s 23 points was also a new career-high as she was responsible for all 23 of UCSB’s bench points, helping the Gauchos outscore UC Davis 23-2 in the statistical category. Her 10 made field goal off 17 shot attempts also is a career best mark.</p>\n<p>“The energy Drea and Onome provided us on the defensive end and how much they attacked and got to the rim was the difference offensively, “Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson explained.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 10-for-10 shooting performance in the third quarter was the game’s deciding factor, forcing the Aggies to play catch-up against a streaking Gauchos team. Santa Barbara ended Friday with a 50 percent field goal percentage (27-of-54) and 42.9 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>After earning a bye in the first two rounds of the Big West Tournament, UC Davis came out of the gates looking like a team that was possibly on its way to a blowout victory. It gained a 7-0 lead through nearly three and a half minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Helping create the early lead was both junior guard Rachel Nagel and redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch. As one of the topm post players in the Big West, Bertsch scored the Aggies’ first basket. The scoring stretch also included a three-pointer by the team’s sharpshooter in Nagel, who finished with a team-high 18 points.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing the Aggies to shoot 42. 9 percent, UCSB held their star play in Bertsch to just 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting before eventually fouling out in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>“We just felt like we needed to defend in transition, because Bertsch rim runs as well as anybody,” Henrickson said. “Even though we lost to them earlier, we felt confident if we could get another shot and defend them in transition we would at least give ourselves a shot to be successful. That was much better for us tonight.”</p>\n<p>Coming out of a timeout, UCSB managed to recuperate along with the help of subbing in Toler, who scored four-straight points off go-ahead layups. Knotting the score at seven apiece was Porter with a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>Joining Toler was Jemerigbe with drives to the paint to give the Gauchos their first lead of the game at 11-9. Back and forth scoring between the two teams led to a 15-13 lead for UC Davis after a made jump shot by Nagel.</p>\n<p>The pace of play would slow down with both teams exchanging scores as ties and lead changes occurred. A three-point differential was the largest margin between the two.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 seconds remaining, Porter knocked down a shot from beyond the arc to put UCSB up 29-27. But a made halfcourt shot to beat the buzzer by Nagel gave UC Davis a 30-29 lead going into the half.</p>\n<p>With both teams vying for momentum, the third quarter worked in favor of UCSB outscoring UC Davis 23-15.</p>\n<p>A 7-0 run with contributions from Toler, redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, and capped off by a made three-pointer by Jemerigbe propelled UCSB to a 40-34 lead. Edelman finished scored nine of her 12 points in the quarter as she concluded with a 4-of-7 shooting and four rebound night.</p>\n<p>Complementing Edelman was Jemerigbe with 10 of her 21 points in the period. The senior scored the team’s only two three-pointers during the quarter and ended it with a layup that increased UCSB’s lead to 52-45 heading into the final 10 minutes of regulation.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer by junior guard/forward Dani Nafekh cut the Gauchos’ lead to 59-54, bringing Davis within its smallest deficit of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Yet, an 8-2 scoring stretch sparked by a long range make by Toler which ended with a three-pointer by sophomore guard Coco Miller led to a 67-56 UCSB lead with 2:50 remaining.</p>\n<p>It would not be enough time for an Aggie comeback as a steal and go-ahead layup by Toler provided the finishing touch to UCSB securing its semifinal victory before closing with Porter at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Long Beach State will play Saturday, March 11 at 4 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim. The game will be nationally televised on Fox Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/","id":529,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[528,527,526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Porter Etches Name in UCSB and Big West History in UCSB Quarterfinal Win Over UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=798%2C402&ssl=1","description":"Big-time player show up in big-time games.

Porter attempted and made each of her field goals from beyond the arc, going 9-of-11 from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The nine made three-pointers also set a new program single-game record, surpassing former Gaucho Erin Alexander’s previous mark of eight.</p>\n<p>UCSB has made at least eight three-pointers in four consecutive games.</p>\n<p>Porter scored 20 of her 31 points in the first quarter. Whether when coming off screens, off the dribble or even contested, Porter’s hot shooting hand was consistent as she made 6-of-6 three-pointers and two free-throws in the game’s first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Balancing Porter’s three-point shooting was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a dominant performance in the paint. For a third time this season, Edelman tied her career-high of 22 points. Also, Edelman’s game-high 14 rebounds led to her tallying her eighth double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Signs of Porter’s career night began with her scoring the game’s first basket form long range. From that point on, both teams exchanged scores. Responding on UCR’s behalf was Malou Thiebaut De Kergret with a made three-pointer to give the Highlanders a 10-8 lead. The sophomore forward had 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting before fouling out later on.</p>\n<p>The one-point deficit was the last time UCSB trailed before responding with a 15-0 run. Sparking the run was Porter with her third-straight three-pointer at the 4:53 mark of the first. The Gauchos’ lead increased from a layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler to 23-10, leading to UCR calling a timeout as it had been held scoreless for a little over five minutes.</p>\n<p>Toler concluded Wednesday night with 13 points, eight assists, and two steals.</p>\n<p>Breaking the Highlanders’ scoring slump was a jumpshot by junior guard Michelle Curry. Junior guard Lauren Holt scored on UCR’s next possession to cut their deficit to single digits at 14-23.</p>\n<p>But another three-pointer by Porter in the final five second of the first quarter gave UCSB a 26-14 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being down to start the second quarter, Curry took matters into her own hands, embarking on an individual 8-2 run that cut UCSB’s lead to 28-22. She scored 11 of her team-high 22 points in the period.</p>\n<p>Although Riverside managed to contain Porter’s perimeter shooting during the quarter, holding her to just one missed shot attempt, UCSB responded with a 7-2 run of its own. The scoring stretch built its lead to 35-24.</p>\n<p>UCR cut the Gaucho’s lead to a five-point deficit three times during the period as a made free-throw by Curry left the Highlanders down 37-42 entering halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 40-26 advantage in both rebounds and points in the paint. The outcome of both values led to Edelman’s big night, which picked up at the start of the second half as she scored the Gauchos first six points of the third.</p>\n<p>Still, the Highlanders continued to claw away at Santa Barbara’s lead. After Curry’s jumpshot brought UCR within three at 48-51 before a layup by UCSB’s Toler, Kergret knocked down a three-pointer on Riverside’s next possession that resulted in a 51-53 deficit with 4:49 remaining in the third.</p>\n<p>As UCSB was in a position of possibly losing its lead, emerging was Porter from beyond the arc to give it a 56-51 lead. Igniting the Gaucho’s 11-4 run to end the period was a three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. Toler scored the team’s last field goal with a layup, helping UCSB enter the fourth with a 67-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Similar to how the game began, Edelman and Porter scored UCSB’s first points in the game’s final period to put the Gauchos up 72-61.</p>\n<p>Porter scored her coveted ninth three-pointer of the game with 5:18 remaining, giving UCSB a 77-63 lead. Both teams would end up trading baskets and taking trips to the free-throw line with Edelman scoring the Gauchos’ last field goal of the game to eventually lock up their victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Davis this Friday, March 10 in the semifinal round of the Big West Tournament at noon. ESPN3 will provide coverage of the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/","id":517,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[516,515,514],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Uncharted Destiny: Toler & Porter Find Best Fit in UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Any amount of time spent away from a sport is one of the most difficult experiences a student-athlete can endure.

The response to the search has been kind as players are intrigued by the thought of a change in scenery.</p>\n<p>Even so, this change hasn’t always warranted a promising outcome. It tends to only scratch the surface, showing what’s most appealing to the eye, sometimes leading student athletes to make questionable decisions.</p>\n<p>Although Toler ended up staying on the West Coast for her first two years of college, the journey to becoming a duck wasn’t a pre-determined destination.</p>\n<p>“Coming out of high school was hard. When I first came out, I actually committed to Sarah’s school, Ole Miss. It was the first school I went to and I just committed without knowing too much about it. I feel like that was more of a freshman thing to do.”</p>\n<p>The period of uncertainty led to Toler’s eventual commitment to Oregon. A change in head coaches between her freshman and sophomore seasons, however, influenced her decision to leave the school.</p>\n<p>Despite her undersized frame, Toler’s speed, ability to drive and court vision were each areas of her game which she believed UCSB catered to, making this the next best school for her.</p>\n<p>“Once I came [to UCSB], it was different because I knew what to look for [regarding] the coaching, type of system and what the school offered academic-wise,” Toler said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a coveted high school career helped build up Porter’s reputation, who became well-known for her scoring ability, as she left Horizon Christian Academy as a member of its 1,000-point club with 1,292 points.</p>\n<p>“I actually originally committed to Fresno State coming out of high school, but the coaches left, so I reopened my recruiting process,” Porter explained. “Ole Miss sounded amazing to me, [but] I kind of went blind into the situation because I didn’t know the coaches that well, which is why it ended up not working out.”</p>\n<p>In the cases of Toler and Porter, it is plausible that the prestige of each of their former universities being within Power Five conferences set the stage for where they thought their future resided.</p>\n<p>After beginning the season on the bench, Porter’s consistency as the Gauchos’ go-to shooter helped land her within the starting lineup as a stretch guard/forward.</p>\n<p>“The third time around, I knew what I wanted to look for,” Porter said. “I wanted to come to a school where I felt comfortable with the coaching staff, the academics were good and they had everything they needed to offer me.”</p>\n<p>Following the end of last season, in which only three seniors graduated, it was a wonder as to how exactly either player would fit into a team with four of its starters returning.</p>\n<p>Understanding that there are no guarantees, especially pertaining to the court, Toler and Porter have certainly answered any concerns prior to entering this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping UCSB capture the No. 4 seed and a first-round bye in the Big West Tournament, each player confirmed the anticipation that surrounded them following their redshirt seasons.</p>\n<p>Toler ended the regular season tied for the conference lead in assists per game with a 4.4 average. Primarily coming off the bench, Toler finished atop the Big West in assists per 40 minutes at 8.3 as well. She also ranked second-best on the team in scoring in conference games at 10.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Porter was another valuable piece as her three-point shooting led to her being one of the top perimeter shooters in the Big West. Her 38.1 three-point percentage during the regular season ranked seventh. Most notably, she placed third in the conference in total three-pointers made with 61, which currently ranks sixth most in a single-season in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>It was unfortunate that the two were forced to sit out during the hype of the hiring of Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. The process was a waiting game, but once that clock expired, the focus returned to helping revive the UCSB women’s basketball program in hopes of winning a conference championship.</p>\n<p>Still, while returning to basketball was the ultimate goal, both expressed the importance of earning their degrees, improving during the offseason and simply continuing playing the game they’ve always dreamt about excelling in.</p>\n<p>As a byproduct of their hard work, Toler and Porter knew they had the potential to thrive at the collegiate level, but it took the right fit in their choice of school to help make that a reality.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76327\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76327\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/","id":507,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[506,505,504],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope To Outpace Cougar Pack While On The Road In Utah","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It has been an uncharacteristic start for the UCSB baseball team as its looks to overcome last weekend's sweep heading into its series at BYU.

The Gauchos only have 11 doubles and zero triples, both bottom numbers in the Big West. However, the Gauchos are tied with Cal State University Northridge for second for most home runs in the Big West with seven. With these seven home runs, though, UCSB has only managed to score a total of 41 runs, 14 of which came in one game against Tulane on Feb. 25.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although these numbers are worrisome, it is important to note how early it is in the season. People forget this is still “Spring Training” for some college hitters.<br>\nAs more and more hitters find their rhythm and timing, the ’Chos will string together some great at-bats at a more consistent basis. After all, hits do come in bunches, and hitting is contagious.</p>\n<p>The Cougars’ pitching staff will provide a tough challenge for Gaucho hitters to get out of this slump, though. Cougar pitching has a pretty solid team ERA of 3.46, giving up only 35 earned runs total in ten games. With UCSB having a predominately lefty lineup, the six left-handed pitchers featured on the BYU roster will also give the Gauchos some trouble.</p>\n<p>The predicted starters that the Gauchos will face in this four-game series are RHPs senior Brady Coreless (2-0), junior Maverik Buffo (1-2), senior Kendall Motes (0-1) and potentially LHP junior Hayden Rogers (0-0). Coreless is the Cougar ace who owns an impressive 1.89 ERA with 23 strikeouts through 19.0 innings pitched.<br>\nThe other two right-handed starters, Buffo and Motes, have had much rougher outings recently as their respective ERAs of 4.50 and 5.14 show. Lefty Rogers will be tough if he gets his second start of the season. Rogers holds a 2.38 ERA with 11.1 innings and six strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Cougar offense is also something not to glance over. Coming into the series, BYU will have five different hitters hitting above the .300 mark. Currently leading the Cougar offense is sophomore right fielder Brock Hale. Hale is hitting for both average and power with a .385 average, three doubles and two home runs on top of driving in nine runs.     Even though this offense looks strong on paper, they will face an even stronger Gaucho pitching staff.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s pitching staff has been the most reliable part of this year’s team. Sophomore starters Noah Davis (2-1) and junior Kyle Nelson (1-2) have been pitching exceptionally well with ERAs of 2.14 and 3.14. Still the third and fourth spots in the rotation are up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Joe Record (0-1, 9.1 IP, 5.79 ERA), the typical Sunday starter for the ’Chos, was moved to the bullpen last week after having a couple rough outings. Junior Steven Ledesma (0-1 10.1, 5.23 ERA) was given the ball instead for his first ever start, but even after pitching impressively in the Gaucho bullpen, Ledesma was rocked, giving up five earned runs in 1.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Junior RHP Chris Clements (0-2, 11.1 IP, 3.18 ERA) is currently in position to take this third spot in the rotation with a decent outing against Saint Mary’s his last start, giving up only two earned runs.</p>\n<p>Still, either Record or Ledesma will make a start this weekend for the Gauchos with the four-game series.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how the Gauchos pitch, it will all come down to offense at the end of the series. UCSB will need to get runners on base and execute their signature West Coast Style Small Ball offense to get runs on the board. Aforementioned, if the Gauchos can string together a couple of good at-bats, an offensive fire could spark to the likes that we have already seen this year in the Tulane series.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76269\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76269\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/","id":4145,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

I think Stephen woke him up a little bit. It’s always cool for me to see teammates pushing each other like that and each coming out with new PRs.”</p>\n<p>Junior Kayla Thayer has a solid chance at attaining first place in the women’s shot put, with her season best of 43′ 6.5” giving her about a three-inch buffer from last year’s winner at Ben Brown. Senior Valerie Nestor should also be able to threaten the top in the hammer after her 56.16 m throw last week.</p>\n<p>Both the men’s and women’s throwing teams have proven early on in the outdoor season that they will be a force all year, with multiple throwers in each event capable of a podium-worthy throw amongst Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Junior Jenna Hinkle (mile and 3000 m) and senior Adam Avila (steeple) will be among the fastest in the collegiate field, hoping to repeat their individual wins last week in their respective events, leading the distance squad to Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The meet begins at 10 a.m. on Friday, March 9, at the Titan Track complex at Cal State Fullerton, and resumes the next day at 9 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-track-field-hopeful-for-another-first-place-finish/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-track-field-hopeful-for-another-first-place-finish/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-track-field-hopeful-for-another-first-place-finish/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-track-field-hopeful-for-another-first-place-finish/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-track-field-hopeful-for-another-first-place-finish/","id":5706,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5705,5704,5703],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Remains in Santa Barbara to Host Baylor and New Mexico","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-8-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis_10-8-16_1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s pair of weekend matchups will be the final two games of its four-match home stand.

The Denver Lady Pioneers are 7-3 and are also coming into their match with UC Santa Barbara with a two-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Denver’s latest game against the Oregon Ducks ended in a 4-2 victory for Denver.</p>\n<p>The Lady Pioneers pair of No. 12 junior Julia O’Loughlin and senior Maureen Slattery were victorious in that match 6-1, and the tandem will surely give the Gauchos’ own doubles pairs some trouble.</p>\n<p>Singles play has been a strong suit for Denver as it is currently on a two-game winning streak, as the team has only dropped one decision out of 10 singles matches.</p>\n<p>The team effort shown by the Gauchos this past weekend will be needed against a team that has shown an ability to succeed against talented rosters.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara will find itself traveling for a brief one-game road trip when they play against the No. 11 Pepperdine Waves.</p>\n<p>The well-equipped roster of the Waves isn’t the only problem for the Gauchos, as UCSB has seen four of its six losses come from ranked opponents.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine is the highest-ranked team the Gauchos have played against all season, and they will have to compete with some exceptional players.</p>\n<p>The Pepperdine Waves have four ranked singles players: No. 6 sophomore Luisa Stefani, No. 15 freshman Ashley Lahey, No. 27 junior Mayar Sherif Ahmed and No. 80 junior Laura Gulbe.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine also has two ranked doubles teams: No. 3 senior Christine Maddox and junior Mayar Sherif and No. 49 sophomore Luisa Stefani and senior Apichaya Runglerdkriangkrai.</p>\n<p>The talent possessed by Pepperdine will keep the Gauchos’ hands full and will make the team work hard to earn the victory.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will play the University of San Diego Toreros on Thursday, March 9, at 10 a.m. and the University of Denver Pioneers on Friday, March 10, at 10 a.m. Santa Barbara will travel for its last game against Pepperdine on Sunday, March 12, at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB held CSUN to a paltry .162 hitting percentage, a far cry from their season percentage of .348.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also limited the Matadors to just two aces over the three sets, again below CSUN’s season average of 1.48 aces per set.</p>\n<p>“It helps us [to get a high-ranked win],” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Things have been a little tough, but our guys are hanging in there and training hard. I told them we tend to make a run at the end of the year, so hopefully, this is the start of another one.”</p>\n<p>UCSB led practically from wire-to-wire, with only a few aberrations in the first two sets. Kills from freshman middle blocker Keenan Sanders, redshirt sophomore middle blocker Connor Drake and junior outside hitter/libero Hayden Boehle pushed the Gauchos out to an early 5-1 lead in the first set, but CSUN battled back to take a 10-7 lead of their own.</p>\n<p>That was as good as it got for the Matadors, however. The Gauchos erased the deficit in minutes and kept on going, pushing their lead to 23-17 and eventually closing out the set 25-20 on a Jacob Delson kill.</p>\n<p>Delson was playing in his first game back after an ankle injury sidelined the star redshirt senior over the weekend against Penn State and Lees-McRae.</p>\n<p>The outside hitter didn’t seem to miss a beat, accumulating 13 kills and eight digs while providing his team with a major lift.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably still just 60, 70 percent, but he played and he’s tough,” McLaughlin said. “It helps.”</p>\n<p>The second set was eerily similar in pattern. UCSB watched an early lead reverse itself by the middle of the set before storming back once again, although the Gauchos never managed to build a lead bigger than four points. In the end, however, CSUN was unable to stave off the inevitable, falling 25-22.</p>\n<p>“We passed the ball really well,” McLaughlin said. “[CSUN] serves the heck out the ball … so we did a lot of repetition toward that, and we handled it. We passed well, and typically when you pass well you’re going to get a good shot.”</p>\n<p>Just as in the two sets prior, UCSB jumped out to an early lead in the third set. CSUN, dutifully following the script, immediately went about trimming the lead down, but the Gauchos managed to never fall behind in the set.</p>\n<p>Instead, a three-point run broke a 14-14 tie and put UCSB ahead 17-14. A few points later, a four-point run pushed the lead out to 23-18, and another kill from Delson sealed what Coach McLaughlin called “the biggest win of the season” for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Sanders was second on the team with eight kills in what was yet another strong game for the middle blocker.

\r\n</script> \n<p>While baseball was invented in the United States, it is a game that has evolved below the equator in many Latin American countries.</p>\n<p>When the U.S. military began to occupy Latin America in the early 1900s, soldiers brought along the game of baseball and the native peoples took it and transformed it.<br>\nGone were the rigid unwritten rules that chastised emotional outbursts and encouraged robotic behavior.</p>\n<p>Latinos played baseball the way they played soccer: with their hearts on their sleeves and exuberance in every at-bat.</p>\n<p>This energy has translated into great success for Latinos in the MLB who, with pioneers like Orlando Cepeda and contemporary phenoms like the late Jose Fernandez, have more than caught up skill- and talent-wise with the “originators” of baseball.</p>\n<p>When Bud Norris says, “We’re opening the game,” he puts himself, and subsequently white men as the gatekeepers of who is allowed to play, essentially disregarding the notion of a meritocracy that is crucial to all sports.</p>\n<p>To behave as though one group has the right to include or exclude people from the game of baseball is to ignore the history of how the game has proliferated to other countries, and it creates a false narrative that devalues the contributions of Latinos to the game.</p>\n<p>The other problematic aspect of this quote is the feeling that Latinos are bringing a sense of disrespect to the game.</p>\n<p>Even though Latinos make up about 26 percent of the league, almost 50 percent of the brawls this year have pitted whites against Latinos.</p>\n<p>Whether it is a Yasiel Puig bat-flip or a Jose Bautista home run trot around the bases that is deemed a little too long, there is something that pisses pitchers (a predominantly white position) off about the way that Latinos play the game.</p>\n<p>However, it isn’t merely the Latino style of play that is aggravating to players; it is the fact that they seemingly don’t respect “American” culture.</p>\n<p>This is exemplified in the recent story of a minor league training room in which a white player killed the radio that some Latinos were listening to some Spanish music on and declared,</p>\n<p>“Hey, Reggaeton, es no bueno. America! English music!”</p>\n<p>This notion that it is somehow disrespectful to America and baseball to express your Latin identity is problematic in that it establishes a hierarchy of cultures in the MLB that allows some players to feel entitled to denounce others not based on their play but on their culture.</p>\n<p>I do not want to give off the impression that this attitude is present in all MLB players. For instance, former catcher Dave Valle learned Spanish while playing winter ball in Latin America for five seasons.</p>\n<p>He said, “The benefits were me having a world view of what my teammates came from.”</p>\n<p>It gave me a better understanding of the Latin culture, and as a teammate, it helped me as a leader to be that bridge between the American guys and Latino guys because I could speak a little bit of Spanish and help them.”</p>\n<p>This drive to create empathy and companionship among different cultures is what is necessary to have a more equal and unified MLB, and only once this is attained can baseball truly be America’s pastime.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
