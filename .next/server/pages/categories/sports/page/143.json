On Sunday, the Gauchos will go on the road to play UC Davis with the possibility of earning a berth to the Big West Tournament if they come out with a win.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara (9-8-1 overall, 3-4 conference) is currently tied for fourth place in the Big West with UC Riverside but is not in control of its destiny by any means. Long Beach State has two more games left and can jump the Gauchos in the standings with two victories. The Aggies (5-8-3 overall, 2-3-1 conference) also have a shot of taking the final spot in the playoffs with a win and losses by other teams.</p>\n<p>It’s been a while since UCSB has gotten this close to the postseason. Two seasons ago, the Gauchos finished last in the conference and last year they finished second to last. This is easily the program’s most important match since 2009 when they competed in the final of the Big West Tournament.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re in playoff mode now. We have to get a result if we want to continue,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “One of our goals all year has been to get to the Big West Tournament; clearly the only shot is to get a result, to get a win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have overcome their recent injuries to remain in contention this late into the conference season. In its last game, UCSB played without as many as seven starters, including freshman defender Sydney Fuertes. Fuertes had previously started all games in the season before her injury.</p>\n<p>Filling in the gap on defense left by Fuertes has been freshman Kailey Hackett and sophomore Savannah Francis. Despite the inexperience of both players, they have been helped by the experience of senior defender Taylor Gehring, junior midfielder Miranda Cornejo and sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter. The trio has helped UCSB to the second best goals against average in the league (0.86).</p>\n<p>“The team has only conceded 16 goals out of 18 games,” Stumpf said. “I would say those three specifically have kept us in more games more than anything.”</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos will have a favorable matchup on defense considering the Aggies have a conference-low 13 goals scored in the entire year and have been shutout on six occasions on the year. Yet, the Gauchos will have to deal with UCD having home-field advantage.</p>\n<p>“There are no easy teams out there; it’s going to be tough. They have a system we like playing against, so some people are going to have to step up,” Stumpf said. “We’re still going to have to defend as well as we have in the first 18 games of the year.”</p>\n<p>On offense, UCSB is led by senior forward Allie Ariniello and junior midfielder Madison Beckley; each are tied with a team-high five goals. Ariniello uses her size to overwhelm her opponents and has been the clinical finisher on the team.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Beckley has been the spark off the bench, contributing with three assists as well. Together, they have put UCSB in third in league with 21 goals.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for Sunday’s game is scheduled at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 31, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/","id":1588,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1587,1586,1585],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Big West Contender","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_20251.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_20251.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB men's basketball season preview","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As the third youngest team in the nation last season, the UCSB men’s basketball team underwent some growing pains en route to a first round exit in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>This season, however, has a chance to be special as UCSB aims to return to the top of the conference.

Williams finished first in the league in rebounds, second in blocks and fourth in points per game, garnering him All Big West First Team honors.</p>\n<p>“Alan is probably the best player in the Big West. He averaged a double-double last year. You can’t argue with that,” senior guard Kyle Boswell said. “He’s a load down low and we’re going to be feeding him. If you guard him single handedly, he’s going to definitely dominate you down low.”</p>\n<p>Williams was once again selected to the preseason All-Conference team and will be one of the most dominant low post players in the entire country let alone the Big West.</p>\n<p>“He’s crucial for us, he’s got to score on the block, he’s got to be a dynamic rebounder, he’s got to be a guy that draws fouls and makes free throws. And we know he will do that,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We believe he’ll average a double-double. If Al doesn’t average 18 and 12 I’ll be surprised.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sam Beeler &amp; Mitch Brewe</p>\n<p>These pair of sophomore forwards will play behind Big Al down low. Each showed promise last season filling in for Williams during injury or foul trouble and project to remain equally involved this season as the sole post players expected to play behind Big Al this season.</p>\n<p>“The big thing with them from last year to this year is their confidence,” Boswell said. “They’re playing a lot more confidently and that happens a lot after your freshman year. They’re playing really well, they’re going to have great contributions down low and we’re going to need them too.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wings/Forwards</p>\n<p>Kyle Boswell</p>\n<p>The reigning Big West Sixth Man of the Year returns as talented a shooter as ever. Boswell averaged 13 points per game last season and finished fourth in the conference with a .419 shooting percentage from beyond the arc. Only one of two seniors, Boswell will once again reprise the role as both a leader in the locker room and the first man off the bench.</p>\n<p>“He’s a great player, a great leader and it seems like he puts in every shot he puts up,” Big Al said. “Having a spark off the bench is always great, especially when you have a guy who can put up 20 points off the bench. That’s really valuable to us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Taran Brown</p>\n<p>Brown finished last season with the all-time record for three-pointers made by a freshman in Gaucho history. The sophomore forward averaged 11.1 points and 5.3 rebounds per game and will once again provide a scoring threat both on the wing and down low with his 6’8” frame.</p>\n<p>“Taran is the most athletic player on our team,” Boswell said. “The thing with Taran is he has to play under control and play on balance. His talent level is tremendous so it’s about him making smart plays on the court.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Michael Bryson</p>\n<p>The sophomore guard finished off last season with tremendous play, scoring a UCSB freshman record 29 points in the first round of the Big West Tournament. Bryson averaged 8.4 points per game last season, a number that increased to over 12.7 per game over the final 12 contests of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>John Green</p>\n<p>Expected to be one of the dominant scorers for UCSB the last two seasons, Green has played in only one game during his college career due to foot injuries. Healthy entering this season, the sophomore guard will be a major addition for Santa Barbara and is projected to be one of its leading scorers.</p>\n<p>“He’s a big time difference maker,” Big Al said. “He can go out there and score the ball; he can post up the little guards, and take the big guys out towards the perimeter. He’s a great shooter and a really great leader, so he will help us a lot.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shawn Moore</p>\n<p>The senior forward provided valuable minutes as a role player and walk-on last season, starting the final six games of the regular season for UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aamahd Walker</p>\n<p>Walker sat out last season plagued by injury, but the redshirt freshman guard may certainly contribute this season as an athletic shooting guard off the bench.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Point Guards</p>\n<p>Zalmico Harmon</p>\n<p>A junior transfer from Ventura College, Harmon is expected to take over the starting point guard role for UCSB this season after T.J. Taylor underwent hip surgery in the offseason. Harmon averaged nearly 16 points and six assists for Ventura last season and plays much bigger than his 6”, 185 pound frame.</p>\n<p>“[Zalmico] is an absolute tank,” Boswell said. “He’s already played in prep school and two years in junior college, so he has a lot of experience under his belt.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eric Childress</p>\n<p>One of two true freshmen for UCSB this season, Childress is expected to compete with Harmon for the starting point spot this season after averaging over 16 points, four assists and 5.6 rebounds per game as a senior in high school.</p>\n<p>“Our point guard position with [Eric and Zalmico] has been very solid,” Coach Williams said. “They’re tough, they defend, they’re good with [the ball]. I like their decision making skills. [Eric] has really come a long way; he’s making very good decisions.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Duke DaRe</p>\n<p>The sophomore walk-on played solid defense for UCSB last season and averaged nearly 12 minutes per game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Depth is certainly not an issue for the Gauchos this season, and with all the hard work put in during the offseason for UCSB, it is no stretch to think the Big West title may once again reside in Santa Barbara come seasons end.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re capable of winning the league and I think we’re capable of winning the Big West tournament at the end of the year,” Coach Williams said. “We’ve got the pieces if we can stay healthy and keep growing.

\r\n</script> \n<p>In addition, after losing its entire starting frontline to graduation, Santa Barbara will feature a much smaller lineup this year, with only two forwards and one center on the roster.</p>\n<p>If any players will look familiar, it will be the guards as UCSB’s trio of seniors will be the leaders of this year’s team.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be obvious with anyone we play we’re going to be undersized,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “But we have an experienced group of guards and they’ve worked extremely hard and it’s their third year in our system.”</p>\n<p>With a new team comes a new style of play, especially on the offensive end. While the Gauchos finished last in the Big West in scoring offense last season at 51.3 points per game, a fast-paced, run-and-gun offense will complement the smaller lineup and the Gauchos will try to spread the floor with guards that can score in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>“I’ll make the adjustment that we’ll have to get up and down,” Mitchell said. “I think in the past, it was in our benefit to find ways to grind it out, but with this team we’re going to have to keep it pretty simple and spread people out because we have to take advantage of our strengths, which is quickness.”</p>\n<p>However, one thing that won’t change under Mitchell’s control is the focus on defense. The coach that has led Santa Barbara to the postseason in her first two years at UCSB will look to up the defensive intensity, implementing a high-pressure press.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Gauchos topped the conference and ranked 20th in the nation in points allowed per game at 52.9 and opponent field goal percentage at 36.2 percent.</p>\n<p>“We know we have to press a lot more,” Mitchell said. “I think it’ll be to our benefit to speed people up and get easy baskets. Hopefully, we’ll get teams into some shot clock issues with our [press]. Now, we can get more aggressive on the ball and in the passing lanes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was picked to finish fifth in the Big West Preseason Poll behind Cal Poly, Hawaii, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“I think we have the chance to be a very good team and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later,” Mitchell said. “Northridge tended to play that same style: quick, small and athletic. That’s probably going to be more of our personality this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Guards</p>\n<p>#1 Kristine Brance (junior)</p>\n<p>Brance may be new to UCSB, but she’s not lacking any experience. The Latvia native transfers to Santa Barbara after playing two years at the nationally ranked Chipola College in Florida, where she led her team in scoring, averaging 14.2 points per game. She shot 39 percent from the field and an incredible 36 percent from three point range. Bringing toughness from her experience, knowledge of how to win, as well as the European style to UCSB, Brance will be critical in providing an offensive spark, especially from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>#2 Jasmine Ware (sophomore)</p>\n<p>In her first season at UCSB, Ware showed her potential to fit into Mitchell’s system, proving to be an effective defensive stopper. In her 11.4 minutes per game last year, she averaged 0.5 steals per contest. This year, as a taller guard at 5’10’’, Ware could help the Gauchos offensively too, as she has a smooth shot from 15 to 17 feet. Mitchell even described her midrange game as “second to none on this team.” Plus, needing to play small and push the ball should play right into Ware’s strengths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#3 Nicole Nesbit (senior)</p>\n<p>One of the three key seniors this season, Nesbit is a two-time All-Big West honorable mention selection. As the floor general last season, she ranked third in minutes at 29.5 per game, second in points per game at 10.5, second in steals per game at 0.8 and led the team in assists per game at 2.8. This season, Nesbit will move over to the shooting guard where she can use her scoring instinct and speed to either get to the basket or rise up for the jumper off the dribble. And the more she can get to the rim, the better because last season she led the team in free throw percentage at an impressive 87.5 percent. According to Mitchell, “we haven’t seen Nic’s best game yet.” She is certainly capable of averaging double digits every night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#10 Onome Jemerigbe (freshman)</p>\n<p>The player allowing Nesbit to slide over to the shooting guard is Jemerigbe. Coming from a great high school team in St. Mary’s High, Mitchell compared her young point guard to Shannon Bobbitt from Tennessee. Giving the Gauchos a different type of point guard, Jemerigbe has a pass first mentality. Lightning quick, she has the lateral foot speed that UCSB has lacked the last few years, which will allow Santa Barbara to hound the opponent’s ball handler and help in transition defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#22 Melissa Zornig (senior)</p>\n<p>The second of the trio of seniors, Zornig is another offensive threat for UCSB. She has the ability to score in a variety of ways, averaging 8.0 points per game and 81 percent shooting from the charity stripe last season. However, Zornig can certainly average double-figures this year, as shown by her career-high 24 points against UC Davis last season. Next to Brance, Zornig will form a duo of three-point threats as she led the team in three-point percentage last year at 32.5 percent. She also averaged 2.2 assists last year and led the team in assist to turnover ratio, exemplifying her high basketball I.Q. As the “most consistent player right now” according to Mitchell, Zornig will be a big part of the team and a leader for Santa Barbara this upcoming season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#33 Destini Mason (senior)</p>\n<p>Rounding out the trio of seniors is Mason, who is known as the athletic defensive stopper for the Gauchos. Described by Mitchell as even “light-years better than last year,” Mason has stepped up as the vocal leader for UCSB. Ranking second on the team in three-point percentage last year at 28.0 percent and third on the team in rebounding, but the top rebounding guard, at 3.8 per game, Mason is an exceptionally versatile player. Like Angelei Aguirre from last season, Mason will be asked to play a lot of minutes in lots of positions, anywhere from one through four.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forwards</p>\n<p>#13 Kendra Morrison (sophomore)</p>\n<p>Morrison only played 5.8 minutes per game last year, but when she did find time on the court, she took advantage, shooting 43.8 percent from the field. Showing what she could do last year against USC where she totaled 11 points on 5-5 shooting, Morrison should expect more minutes this season with the lack of depth at the forward position. With a high basketball I.Q. and the ability to open up the offense because she is a stronger body who can also knock down the three, it could be a breakout season for Morrison.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#34 Mi’Chael Wright (freshman)</p>\n<p>In high school, Wright averaged 12.7 points and 9.4 rebounds. Now here at UCSB, Wright is a blue-collar player with a knack for rebounding, which will be critical for the Gauchos because if they’re going to play a faster style, they have to be able to rebound. Described by Mitchell to be like Charles Barkley or a more offensively- minded Aguirre from last season, Wright has the ability to put up 10-12 points a night simply on hustle and her notable basketball I.Q.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Center</p>\n<p>#12 Melissa Maragnes (freshman)</p>\n<p>At 6’2’’, Maragnes will be the tallest player on the UCSB roster this season and be responsible for guarding the opponent’s center. At St. Monica High School, she averaged 9.9 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game, setting the school’s block record at 60. As an amazing athlete who Mitchell says plays “almost above the rim,” Maragnes has the potential of becoming a big-time player for Santa Barbara in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of October 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Ramon Rovirosa</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52675\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52675\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/","id":604,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[603,602,601],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Projected Top Five Picks of the  NFL Draft: Marcus Mariota Goes First to the Jaguars","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Marcus Mariota Goes First to the Jaguars","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Jacksonville Jaguars — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>Jacksonville is perhaps the worst team in the NFL since the 2008 Lions finished the season 0-16. The Jaguars are finishing this season with two wins at most and should secure the first pick. While Jadeveon Clowney is the highest-rated player on most experts’ draft boards, the Jaguars need a franchise quarterback and cannot afford to pass up the opportunity. Blaine Gabbert simply isn’t getting the job done. Mariota is an interesting dual-threat quarterback with unlimited potential, as he is only a redshirt sophomore at Oregon. If he keeps improving as a passer this year and helps the Ducks to a BCS title, he could very well be the first pick.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Jadeveon Clowney, DE, South Carolina</p>\n<p>Tampa Bay hasn’t been much better than Jacksonville this year and has yet to win a game. A new quarterback doesn’t seem to be an option here as the Buccaneers have faith in rookie Mike Glennon to develop into a formidable option. That’s when the Buccaneers go for the highest-rated player rather than the area of most need. Clowney is a once-in-a-decade-type athlete with the size and power of a defensive end and the speed of a safety. Tampa Bay would be foolish to pass up on Clowney and could pair him up on the defensive line with Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. That would certainly improve the Buccaneers’ defense and give them a multitude of weapons similar to their glory days in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Last season, Minnesota rode Adrian Peterson’s record season to the playoffs, but with A.P. slowed down this year, the Vikings are once again floundering The Vikings trio of quarterbacks in Christian Ponder, Josh Freeman and Matt Cassel don’t seem like likely long-term options in Minnesota, although Freeman certainly has an opportunity to change the front office’s mind once he returns from injury. Bridgewater entered this season as the top-rated quarterback, but Mariota simply has more upside and has performed better to date. The Louisville signal caller has the poise in the pocket to balance a Minnesota attack so heavily reliant on the run.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Louis Rams — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Just when the Rams look like they’ve turned a corner, starting quarterback Sam Bradford tears his ACL in a season-ending injury. With Kellen Clemens as the current starter for St. Louis, there does not appear to be much hope in the Gateway City this season. Bradford will be back and fully healthy next season with a young array of offensive weapons. Defensively, St. Louis is set at the most important positions, so the Rams will look to upgrade their offensive line with Matthews replacing the oft-injured Rodger Saffold at right tackle. Matthews has done a superb job of protecting Johnny Football’s blind side the last two seasons at A&amp;M and should have no trouble sliding over to the right side of the line and protecting Bradford this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Steelers — Anthony Barr, OLB, UCLA</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh has been the biggest disappointment in the NFL this season. Defense has always been the key to success for the Steelers, and adding an elite pass rusher who can wreak havoc in Pittsburgh’s 3-4 system looks to be the smartest move. Add Barr to a core of linebackers including LaMarr Woodley, Jarvis Jones and Lawrence Timmons and Pittsburgh might feature the best and most athletic group of linebackers in the game. Barr has been a defensive revelation for UCLA after switching over from playing fullback during his first two seasons. He has the size and speed to slide over to defensive end if need be and does a solid job not only rushing the quarterback, but also roaming the field, racking up tackles and even dropping back into coverage. This guy is a freak of an athlete and the best defensive prospect other than Clowney.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52662\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52662\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/","id":3238,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3237,3236,3235],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Projected Top Five Picks of the  NFL Draft: Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Jacksonville Jaguars — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Jacksonville’s woes don’t figure to end at any point.

Instead, Freeman is now a benchwarmer for the Minnesota Vikings, leaving Vincent Jackson and Mike Glennon as the only notable players on a porous offense. The defense is actually alright, especially against the run. Clowney is far and away the best player in the draft, and the only way he doesn’t go to the Bucs here is via a trade. An elite pass rusher is the only missing ingredient from this defense and would be exactly what Tampa Bay needs to get back to their smash-mouth, physical style that took them to the Super Bowl over a decade ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>The signing of Josh Freeman signifies the end of the Christian Ponder era in Minnesota. However, after Freeman’s cringe-worthy debut for the Purple People Eaters, it is clear that their franchise QB is not on this roster at the moment. Enter Mariota. The redshirt sophomore phenom is skyrocketing up draft boards and is now being ranked even higher than Teddy Bridgewater. Mariota’s 95.5 Total Quarterback Rating is tops in the nation and better than all of the last four Heisman-winning quarterbacks. He has elite athleticism comparable to Robert Griffin III, and this season he has added the ability to throw deep passes down the sidelines. Bridgewater is considered more of a sure thing, and thus more likely to go number one. But Mariota has the highest upside of any offensive player in the draft and has a chance to leapfrog into the number one spot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Giants — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Through the first six games of the season, New York was historically awful, even giving the Jaguars a run for their money as worst in the league. They seemed to have turned it around a bit, although their only two wins have come against a demoralized Vikings team and a beat-up Eagles team. Their point differential and unbalanced team composition are the makeup for a terrible team, and they need to add some great role players to contend next year. A franchise left tackle like Matthews would help protect Eli Manning, restore the capacity to utilize Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks and rejuvenate the worst running game in football. A playmaker on defense is also a possibility, but I expect NY to look to improve an offense that earlier in the season got shut out by the Carolina Panthers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Texans — Sammy Watkins, WR, Clemson</p>\n<p>This would be the pick if the season ended today and no trades were made, but I don’t expect it to actually shape up this way. Houston needs a quarterback, but with Mariota and Bridgewater off the board, there is no player worthy of a top five pick. I expect Houston to trade down and go after someone like Brett Hundley, Tajh Boyd or Johnny Manziel. However, all this considered, Watkins would be a solid pick for the Texans here. An explosive playmaker on offense, Watkins has the potential of an elite number one to take the place of the slowing Andre Johnson.

A strong Gaucho defense led by freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt took advantage of a Riverside team plagued by attacking errors.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came out firing with 7-2 leads in each of the first two sets, winning those 25-17, 25-15. In the third set, the Highlanders got off to a good start with a 5-3 lead, but from there it was all UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on a 5-0 run and dominated the rest of the way, winning 25-16, capping off the first half of a 6-0 weekend.</p>\n<p>Thompson and Spindt led an unstoppable offense on the night with a combined 26 kills and a .521 hitting percentage. Sully once again played excellently at libero with 16 digs, and Grunt led the middle with five block assists.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a road match against rival Cal Poly that will be played Saturday, 7 p.m. at the Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/","id":5278,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5277,5276,5275],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 6 UCSB Defeats No. 7 Long Beach, Falls to No. 1 USC","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WaterPolo11_KevinYang_10.05.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WaterPolo11_KevinYang_10.05.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB split a pair of weekend matches against ranked opponents.

UCSB answered back with a quick goal from sophomore attacker Kevin Cappon, followed by another Trojan goal. Cappon responded by scoring his second goal of the day and then senior attacker Matt Gronow followed with two consecutive goals to bring the Gauchos within reach. The back and forth offense of the first period ended in a close 6-4 Trojans lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s strong offensive momentum carried into the second period, but it was equally countered by USC’s quick offensive return. Cappon scored his third goal of the game, and junior attacker Eric Van de Mortel scored two goals of his own, one resulting from a rebounded penalty shot. The second period ended with another close score of 9-7.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game slowed down offensively with the Gauchos scoring only three goals in comparison to USC’s seven. Van de Mortel put two more points on the board, and Cappon scored another goal in the final quarter giving them both a total of four goals each for the game. USC’s leading scorer, senior two-meter Connor Virjee, scored five goals total, contributing to the Trojans 16-10 win.</p>\n<p>“There are definitely some positives, we shot the ball really well today,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “Nobody has scored more than 12 goals against us all season, so that is disappointing.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game at Long Beach had a more promising result with a strong offensive attack early on, and a final score of 9-6.</p>\n<p>“This weekend was big, especially Saturday. It clinched us in the top six of our conference so we won’t find ourselves in a dogfight later on,” Cappon said.</p>\n<p>Long Beach jumped out in front with the first goal of the game. Less than a minute later Van de Mortel made UCSB’s offensive presence known, tying the game 1-1. Within the first half of the game, two goals each from Van de Mortel and Cappon, and a single goal from senior attacker Matt Gronow and sophomore attacker Ryan Baliani gave the Gauchos a 7-3 lead.</p>\n<p>A low scoring third quarter allowed for the UCSB defense to shine.

Our game plan was to make sure we worked hard starting from our forwards and going down all the way to the goalie,” senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “Our forwards gave us the running and our defense was pretty solid. Josh was outstanding for us and nothing went past him.”</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB outshot Cal Poly 14-13 with a 7-5 advantage on shots on goal. Cal Poly senior forward Mackenzie Pridham, the nation’s leading goal scorer, contributed six shots and three on goal but came up empty thanks to a phenomenal performance from McNeely.</p>\n<p>Campion led UCSB with four shots, three on goal, while senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko contributed four shots and two on goal.</p>\n<p>“We got some chances, but at the end of the day we are happy we got the point,” Baiden said. “We stay undefeated and we keep working towards staying undefeated in the Big West season.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now need just one point in their remaining three games to clinch the Big West North Division.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to focus on trying to win our last three games and hopefully do something historic and go undefeated in conference,” McNeely said.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts UC Davis on Saturday for a 7 p.m. match.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 28, 2013’s print edition  of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-big-west/","id":1584,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1583,1582,1581],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall in Blue-Green Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to rival Cal Poly on senior night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the only Blue-Green rivalry match of the season between the first and second place teams in the Big West, Cal Poly proved why they are in first place, defeating the UCSB women’s soccer team 2-1 on Friday in the final regular season game at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>Two second-half goals by the nation’s leading scorer, sophomore forward Elise Krieghoff, was enough to push the Mustangs past the Gauchos.

With the loss, UCSB drops to 9-8-1 overall and 3-4 in the conference. The defeat endangers the Gauchos’ chance of qualifying for the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009. UCSB will need to at least win its next game against UC Davis to maintain any chance of qualifying for postseason play.</p>\n<p>It is the 12th time this season the Gauchos have been involved in a game decided by a one-goal margin, including all of its conference games.</p>\n<p>Despite emotions running high for the Gauchos after honoring their five seniors on Senior Night, UCSB came out flat in the first 15 minutes of the game. Under heavy pressure in the opening moments, Santa Barbara soon settled in to match Cal Poly’s intensity. With both sides playing evenly on both sides of the pitch, the game went scoreless into halftime.</p>\n<p>“There are extended periods where you have to weather the storm and after 15 or so minutes we weathered the storm,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “I think from then on the game was relatively even, but it did take us 15 or so minutes to match the energy.”</p>\n<p>It did not take long for Cal Poly to break the scoreless draw in the second half. Unable to score in any of her three shots taken in the first half, Krieghoff broke through in the 50th minute with a shot from outside of the box that lofted over sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter’s outstretched hand into the corner of the net.</p>\n<p>Just three minutes later, Krieghoff found the back of the net again for her 20th goal of the season. This time a breakdown resulted in Ritter leaving her goal early. Krieghoff sidestepped Ritter and had an open shot on goal to give Cal Poly a 2-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>“[In the] second half they just found their chances and put them away,” junior midfielder Miranda Cornejo said. “Honestly there was nothing we can do about [the first goal], it was about 30 yards out, a bender in the top so that was a tough one. [Kreighoff] is the number one scorer in the nation.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was not without its opportunities. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley had a shot rebound to her with the goalkeeper out of position and sent the ball just left of the open net. Not until the 80th minute did the Gauchos find the back of the net on a cross that connected with Beckley’s head, hitting the crossbar and pushed in by Ariniello. It was Ariniello’s team-high fifth goal.</p>\n<p>The last game of the regular season for UCSB will be a must-win road game at UC Davis on Sunday at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52639\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52639\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/","id":1586,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1585,1584,1583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Battles Rival Cal Poly for Postseason Positioning","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_12.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_12.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has a chance to make the conference tournament for the first time since 2009.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Most UCSB-Cal Poly matchups already come with an added amount of intensity; however, you will be hard-pressed to find a Blue-Green rivalry game with as much on the line as tomorrow’s game.

It’s exciting for all of us to be really close to reaching our goal.”</p>\n<p>UCSB currently stands at 9-7-1 overall and is in a second-place tie in the Big West conference at 3-3.

Meanwhile, UCSB has not played in the postseason since 2009, but with a victory it will inch closer.</p>\n<p>“The season is coming to an end and the girls are in a very good position to meet one of their goals and that is to get back to the Big West Tournament,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter has emerged as the Gauchos’ most consistent player in only her first year starting. All of UCSB’s wins this year have come by way of shutout with Ritter producing eight of those, the most by a Gaucho since 2003. In her last game, Ritter had a career-high 10 saves and shutout the opponent in the previous home game against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>“Really it’s just the defense. We’re stepping up strong, we had a few starters out [against UC Riverside], so we had a makeshift lineup in our defense and they stepped up,” Ritter said. “Some freshman did great and carried the ball out of there.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will take advantage of a hampered UCSB squad that started two freshmen in the backline in its previous two games. Cal Poly sophomore forward Elise Krieghoff, the leading goal scorer in the country, will try to exploit Santa Barbara’s inexperience.</p>\n<p>Krieghoff has been named Big West Player of the Week five times already and her 18 goals is a school record and third all-time in Big West history.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t really been focusing on her in our game plan,” Gankema said. “We’re trying to focus on us and how we’re going to come out. We know that she has scored a lot of goals so we just have to make sure we do well in defending.”</p>\n<p>Besides playing to remain in postseason contention, an extra incentive is to send the five Gaucho seniors, including Gankema, off with a win in their final regular season home game of their careers.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be really pumped up because I know it’s my last home game and we have a lot to prove, especially against Cal Poly,” Gankema said. “Just having the thought that it’s our last home game will help everyone want to work even harder, for the seniors and for each other.”</p>\n<p>Friday night’s match against Cal Poly is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 24, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB has gone undefeated against Long Beach so far this season, although both games ended in close scoring range. The first time they met at the NorCal Tournament in late September, UCSB won by a final score of 5-4, and more recently at the SoCal tournament, UCSB defeated Long Beach in a dramatic overtime ending with a score of 8-6.</p>\n<p>“We beat Long Beach twice, but we struggled on the power play the last time we played them,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “That has been a main focus this week in practice.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has yet to play USC this season, but it will likely be a challenging game at home as the Trojans head into Gaucho territory with momentum, having won nine straight games.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t played USC, which is a good and bad thing,” Wigo said. “It’s tough that they are number one, but also we really need that extra motivation going into the game.”</p>\n<p>In order to remain undefeated over Long Beach, the Gauchos will have to maintain a strong and consistent defense throughout the entire game. In their most recent match against the 49ers, the Gauchos took an early lead but allowed the 49ers to score in the third and fourth quarter, sending the game into overtime. The two Long Beach players that pose the biggest threat offensively are leading scorers sophomore defender Zacchary Kappos with 37 on the year, and sophomore attacker Nolan McConnell with 30 on the year.</p>\n<p>“For Long Beach we know how we can beat them and what we need to do, we just need to concentrate and keep our minds right,” junior attacker Eric Van de Mortel said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face another strong offense against USC which is currently averaging 17 goals a game. Sophomore goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge will serve as the rock for UCSB’s defense as it faces two leading scorers who have amounted over 50 goals each this season. USC’s senior driver Nikola Vavic has 57 goals and junior driver Kostas Genidounias has 53 goals on the season.</p>\n<p>To be victorious this weekend, UCSB will need to play strong defense against Long Beach, and then return to Santa Barbara ready to rack up the goals against high scoring USC.</p>\n<p>It is still early on in the MPSF conference games, but UCSB is tied for third place with a split record of 1-1 with Stanford and Cal. USC is currently ranked in second place with a record of 1-0 and Long Beach is ranked sixth with a record of 0-0, not having played any conference games yet.</p>\n<p>When asked about the team’s goals for this weekend and beyond, Van de Mortel said, “We never want to put an NCAA championship out of our minds; that would be the ultimate goal.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game against Long Beach will start at noon at the 49er Campus Pool and Sunday’s home game against USC will also begin at noon at UCSB’s Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 6 and 7 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kevin Yang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52612\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52612\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/","id":5118,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5117,5116,5115],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Central Coast Showdown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-32.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-32.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes a seven-match winning streak to rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There’s a reason the Blue-Green Rivalry is the top rivalry in all of college soccer.

With their longest winning streak since 2010, the Gauchos enter Friday night with much confidence with a chance to clinch the Big West North Division title.</p>\n<p>After missing the postseason last year, the Gauchos have already clinched a spot in the conference tournament this year and will outright claim the division with a victory or tie against Cal Poly on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are coming off a 2-1 victory over Sacramento State on Tuesday night, a victory which set the Gauchos with the opportunity to clinch the division on their rival’s home field tomorrow night.</p>\n<p>“I think we kind of took some pressure off of that because [Sacramento State] was the game I felt like we had to have,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Now I think that we can actually go up to Cal Poly without the same kind of stress. I think we can play fairly carefree up there, actually, without a whole lot to lose.”</p>\n<p>This season has been a rollercoaster of a ride for UCSB as the Gauchos won three straight come-from-behind overtime matches entering Tuesday night. Now with a postseason trip already in hand, UCSB is focused on one thing and one thing only: Defeating its rival.</p>\n<p>“I think what’s interesting about Cal Poly is we’ve taken the pressure off of us because the reality is we’ve got a three-game lead. We’re playing at their place,” Vom Steeg said. “If we beat them or tie them this whole thing is kind of done, we’re the winner of the North and it’s all good.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly enters Friday with mixed results in Big West play thus far. After winning its first conference game, the Mustangs lost three straight matches before rebounding with a victory over Sacramento State. Cal Poly did not help its cause Tuesday night, when it tied UC Davis, the team the Mustangs are battling against for the second postseason spot in the North division.</p>\n<p>Despite the Mustangs’ modest success, this week’s installment of the Blue-Green Rivalry is all the buzz in San Luis Obispo as a sellout crowd of 11,075 is expected Friday night. Luckily for UCSB, the Gauchos are used to playing in front of record-number crowds.</p>\n<p>“If there’s ever a team that can go up there with their environment [it’s us],” Vom Steeg said. “The field’s really tight, the fans, the stands, the whole setup over there is just really different than our place, other than the people. I do feel like this is the kind of team that can go up there and get a win.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Mustangs will be the conference’s leading goal scorer in senior forward Mackenzie Pridham who has totaled 12 goals on the year. Pridham is tied for tops in the entire nation in goals scored and Cal Poly’s 36 goals lead the conference, so the Gauchos will certainly have their hands full Friday.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB is up to the challenge, as it ranks first in the conference with only 14 goals allowed in 16 games played this season. This will be a critical matchup of the Big West’s top defense trying to slow down the conference’s top offense.</p>\n<p>“We’re so excited for [this matchup],” Boyoko said. “I’m sure coach is going to come back with a good tactic to go there and actually win the game.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday’s Blue-Green Rivalry at Alex G. Spanos Stadium is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52614\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/52614/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52614\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/52614/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/52614/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/52614/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/52614/","id":1583,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1582,1581,1580],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Five-Game Win Streak on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_09.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_09.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is in second place in the Big West following a five-game winning streak.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team has found a winning combination as of late and will be hoping to ride the momentum of a five-match winning streak into road matches against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton this weekend.</p>\n<p>After starting the season off slowly, the Gauchos now find themselves tied for second in the Big West with a 10-8 overall, 5-1 conference record.

While the Highlanders’ offense has only managed to compile a .119 kill percentage as a team, they do boast one of the conference’s top liberos in Maddie Hubbell. Although she’s just a freshman, Hubbell is third in the Big West with an average of 3.93 digs per set.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important for us to just stay focused on treating these opponents like we would treat any other opponents,” senior outside hitter Leah Sully said. “We need to treat every opponent like they’re going to give us their best.”</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos travel to play Fullerton, they will be looking for ways to dissect a strong Titan defense that leads the Big West with 17.72 digs per set. UCSB will also be busy trying to stop junior setter Julie Consani, whose 10.84 assists per set is good for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working on our defense every day,” Thompson said. “We feel like we can win a lot of long rallies, so we’re trying to be error-free offensively and keep moving our feet to the ball.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have the second-lowest amount of errors in the Big West this year, something that has benefited them greatly. Their offense is by no means overly prolific, as they are second to last in both kills and assists per set, but they have found ways to win nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Thompson has been a dominant hitter all year, averaging 3.45 kills per set and freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt has made an excellent impact defensively. Her 1.08 blocks per set are fourth best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The match against Riverside will begin Friday at 7 p.m. and the Gauchos will close out their weekend against Fullerton on Saturday at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 24, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/","id":5277,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5276,5275,5274],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Down But Never Out: Leah Sully Battles Back from Injury","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Leah Sully Battled Back From a Torn ACL","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There are a select few injuries in sports that every athlete can only hope they never have to experience. Breaking bones can be pretty bad, and rupturing an Achilles can end your career, but one of the more common dreaded injuries is a torn ACL. The increasingly prevalent season-ending knee injury can happen to anyone at anytime, ending a promising season or even a career in a flash.</p>\n<p>Some players never come back from tearing their ACL. Those who do usually find it difficult to perform at the same level they did prior to the injury. Players tend to come back a little slow at first, and it usually takes some time before anyone can really say what long-term effects the injury has had on them.</p>\n<p>Leah Sully, co-captain of the UCSB women’s volleyball team, is one of those players who didn’t play at the same level she was at before tearing her ACL. Actually, she just got better.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sully came to UCSB as a hot recruit by former Gauchos’ Head Coach Kathy Gregory, and she did not disappoint during her freshman year. She was third on the team with 223 kills and led the entire Big West with 52 service aces. In the only NCAA tournament appearance of her college career against St. Mary’s, she posted a then-career-high 20 digs.</p>\n<p>“Her first year she was a tremendous impact player,” Gregory said. “Her hitting was good, but that wasn’t the most important thing. She was a great all-around player. Her passing, defense and serving were what was really good.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the first match of her sophomore season, Leah came down with the injury that ended her year just as it began.</p>\n<p>“It was tough because I was excited to have a good season and it’s just a hard thing to cope with in the beginning,” Sully said. “Once I got over that initial hump though, I was just trying to work hard at rehab and push myself to get back as quick as I could.”</p>\n<p>Her coach, however, looked only at the positives that she believed would come from an injury of such magnitude.</p>\n<p>“As difficult as it is to go through an injury, there’s always a silver lining,” Gregory said. “She sat out a year and her hitting got better and better, and by the last year I coached she was the go-to hitter. She really developed her all-around game.”</p>\n<p>While most athletes fear that knee injuries will hinder their physical abilities in a more general sense, when it comes to a sport like volleyball, players and coaches are more concerned with one thing in particular: jumping. Sully made it a point to battle her way into peak physical form before the start of the next season and prove that that would not be an issue.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to improve my vertical,” Sully said. “That was the biggest thing, and I ended up gaining two inches when I came back to the team.”</p>\n<p>Since coming back from her injury, Sully has led the Gauchos in total kills, digs and aces, further solidifying her reputation as an all-around player. She has earned All-Big West First Team honors, she’s placed her name all over the UCSB record books, and she will surely hit many more statistical milestones before her time is done. Despite all of these accomplishments though, there are still a few goals that have continued to elude her.</p>\n<p>“Obviously I would like to go as far in NCAA as possible,” Sully said. “But a Big West title would be huge.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a difficult preseason this year, going 5-7, but they received some bad news before their first conference game of the season when an MRI showed that Sully had a sprained ligament in her elbow. As the team’s top outside hitter, it wasn’t a very good time for her to be forced to sit out games for the first time since her ACL tear.</p>\n<p>As a result, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch moved Sully to libero; a position where she could play without risking further injury, but also one which she had never before started at in college. Since that decision, UCSB has gone on a tremendous 5-1 run to start their Big West campaign, highlighted by an incredible road win over No. 9 Hawaii in which Sully had a game-high 22 digs.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of what position she’s playing, she’s trying to win at everything,” Sully’s teammate senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “There’s always this intensity and heart to play 100 percent, to just leave it all out there.”</p>\n<p>Thompson perhaps knows better than anybody what Sully went through while rehabilitating her ACL because she too was sidelined for the majority of the 2009 season with a knee injury.</p>\n<p>“After she came back, her mindset completely changed, and she was more driven than ever,” Thompson said. “Her mindset is just so aggressive, she wants to win so badly and she’ll do whatever it takes and play whatever position she’s assigned to.”</p>\n<p>During her time as a Gaucho, Sully has excelled in everything she’s been tasked with doing on the court. Since tearing her ACL, she became the team’s number one hitter, she has been a calming force on the defense whether she’s playing libero or any other position, and she’s become a true leader for her teammates both on and off the court. Not surprisingly, she can owe much of her success to the time she was forced to spend off the court.</p>\n<p>“That knee injury was really inspirational for me because I had never had a serious injury before,” Sully said. “Just always having that in the back of my mind, every day when I come into practice there’s times when I think about it and how I couldn’t play for so long. It really makes you want to practice every day as hard as you can.”</p>\n<p>The silver lining that Coach Gregory foresaw may just be the reason why Leah Sully has, and will continue to be one of the best women’s volleyball players that UCSB has ever been lucky to call a Gaucho.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52583\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52583\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/","id":3230,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3229,3228,3227],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 2 Gauchos Win Seventh Straight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-18.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-18.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB clinched a conference postseason appearance Tuesday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>While overtime has been kind to the No. 2 UCSB men’s soccer team recently, the Gauchos were happy to avoid extra time Tuesday night as Santa Barbara defeated Sacramento State 2-1 for its seventh consecutive victory, clinching a conference postseason spot in the process.</p>\n<p>Entering Tuesday, UCSB had won three straight overtime matches.

It appeared as if UCSB might need another overtime period if they wanted to pull out the victory.</p>\n<p>“We were heading that way, but this was a game that had all the trappings of a disaster tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “I’m excited we won tonight. We needed one player to step up and give us a big play, and obviously [Jome] stepped up and gave us a big play.”</p>\n<p>Jome ensured UCSB would avoid overtime with a tremendous unassisted play in which he powered his way through multiple defenders to retrieve the ball moments after he lost it, sending a goal past the diving arms of the goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>“He’s been very good in first halves, but he’s kind of disappeared in second halves,” Vom Steeg said. “So we were very excited tonight about the fact that he gave us a really good push in the moment of the game where we needed him.”</p>\n<p>For Sacramento State, it was the team’s sixth consecutive loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB, meanwhile, holds a large lead in the Big West North and already ensured it will play in the postseason for the 11th time in the last 12 years.</p>\n<p>“It feels great because we had some tough losses … where we played really well but we didn’t get the victory. Now we’re getting the victories we deserve,” Jome said.</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to rival Cal Poly on Friday. Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52585\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/no-2-gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52585\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/no-2-gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/no-2-gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/no-2-gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/no-2-gauchos-win-seventh-straight/","id":1581,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1580,1579,1578],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/sports","page":143,"highestPage":360}},"__N_SSG":true}
