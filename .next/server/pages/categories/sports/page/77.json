The loss was a tough one for the Bruins as it dropped them to 24-26 on the season and ruined their chances of making the postseason this year, as they needed to win their final seven games.</p>\n<p>The win was a much-needed one for Santa Barbara as it brings their road record to 8-11-1 and gives them momentum heading into its final road series of the season this weekend. It also broke the Gauchos two-game losing streak they were on after dropping the last two matches of the Cal State Fullerton series this past weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara came out of the gates strong in the pitching department as redshirt junior James Carter added to his previous strong outings by throwing two hard innings and allowing only two hits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finally broke through in the top of the third inning to take a 1-0 lead after redshirt junior center fielder Andrew Calica hit a one-shot home run, his fourth of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB added one run in both the fourth and fifth innings to take a solid 3-0 lead after six innings of play. In the seventh, however, the Bruins came to life scoring three runs and tying the game. Freshman catcher Jake Hirabayashi, senior second baseman Brett Urabe and junior first baseman Luke Persico all recorded RBI-singles for the three runs.</p>\n<p>All three runs were unearned and, therefore, did not count towards freshman pitcher Kyle Hatton’s ERA; however, the damage was done and once again it looked like Santa Barbara was going to blow a lead.</p>\n<p>However, in the top of the eighth, the Gauchos proved that they can bounce back and re-took a one-run lead at 4-3 after redshirt sophomore JJ Muno hit the game-winning double RBI for his team.</p>\n<p>Pitchers Justin Kelly and Kyle Nelson sealed the deal in the bottom of the eighth and ninth frames to secure a one-run victory. Kelly, a redshirt senior, picked up his first win of the season while Nelson, a redshirt sophomore, picked up his seventh save of the season.</p>\n<p>The victory was also the 11th win of the one-run variety for the young Gaucho team, a good sign that they are not afraid of being in tight ball games although they have let some slip.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB’s victory was a solid one, and it hopefully gives the team fire as it travels to UCI for its final road series of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not won a series at Irvine since 1986, which is coincidentally also the last time it won a Big West title.</p>\n<p>Although they have taken two series victories in 2013 and 2015, the Gauchos are 14-28 against the Anteaters since 2002 and any momentum that they have gained through the UCLA win should definitely be welcomed as they head into that tough environment.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UCI at Cicerone Field for a three game series this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They are currently playing the worst baseball they have all season after going 2-5 in the last seven games, and with three of those losses coming at home, a place where UCSB had only lost once this season prior to this current stretch of games.</p>\n<p>The Titans are now 32-17 overall with a 14-4 Big West record, good for first place in the standings. With six games remaining in conference play, CSUF now has a three-game lead over second place LBSU — who they have yet to play — and a four-game lead over UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sunday’s game was a big one for the Gauchos, as they still had a chance to win the series over a very good Fullerton team. They also needed to bounce back from an embarrassing 18-2 loss on Saturday.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara started off the game slow, allowing two runs in the first inning to Fullerton. CSUF then extended its lead to 3-0 after adding a run in the third inning.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth, the Gauchos finally struck back as a two-RBI double by junior utility player Billy Fredrick brought them back to within one run.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning, UCSB tied the game at 3-3 after a solid RBI double from redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford.</p>\n<p>Although three runs were enough to win Friday’s game, it was not enough to beat the Titans on Sunday, as they rallied off one run to take a 4-3 in the seventh courtesy of a wild pitch from redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson.</p>\n<p>After that, CSUF never looked back. In the eighth inning they scored two more runs to take a 6-3 lead after an error by the UCSB second baseman scored two Fullerton runners.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went cold the last three innings, mustering only one hit, which led to their eventual 6-3 loss.</p>\n<p>Nelson (6-1) picked up his first loss of the season after allowing the go-ahead run in the seventh. On the CSUF side, junior pitchers Dylan Prohoroff (1-1) and Scott Serigstad combined to allow only one hit in the final 3.1 innings of play.</p>\n<p>Before losing the series on a tough game, Santa Barbara suffered its worst loss of the season after being blown out on their home turf by a final score of 18-2.</p>\n<p>The Titans were able to score at least one run in seven of the nine innings of the match and their seven-run outburst — which came when they were already up 7-2 — in the sixth inning is what put away the Gauchos for good.</p>\n<p>The 18-run, 21-hit game allowed by the Gauchos is the most they allowed all season in both those categories, with their 16-run loss being their worst run differential loss of the year.</p>\n<p>CSUF designated hitter Ruben Cardenas had a career day, setting career highs in hits and RBIs. The freshman went 4-6 (.667) with six RBIs, three runs scored and a big two-run homer in the seventh inning, his second of the season.</p>\n<p>Senior first baseman Tanner Pinkston also had a great game, going 4-5 (.800) with three RBIs and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the nine innings, Titan pitchers combined to allow only four hits and two runs while striking out seven batters. Nothing went right for the Gauchos on either end of the mound.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s embarrassing loss, UCSB actually managed to gain the early advantage on CSUF after sneaking by with a 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the second inning as redshirt sophomore third baseman J.J. Muno hit his fifth home run of the season, a solo shot that put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Titans responded in the fourth inning after junior infielder Timmy Richards hit his team high eighth home run of the season to tie the game up at one.</p>\n<p>UCSB then hit another home run, this one courtesy of freshman catcher Sam Cohen — the first of his career — to re-take a one run lead at 2-1.</p>\n<p>CSUF tied the game at two after another RBI from Richards, but the Gauchos freshman infielder Tevin Mitchell hit an RBI ground out to take the 3-2 lead after the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Nelson then picked up his sixth save of the season after pitching the final two frames, allowing only one hit.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber (9-3) pitched a great game, allowing only six hits and two runs in seven innings pitched while also striking out six batters. The win gave him the 20th of his career, and he is now tied for eighth in UCSB program history for career wins.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara squandered an amazing opportunity to really move up the rankings and break the slump it has been in. Instead, its two home losses this past weekend tied its loss total in the first 24 home games of the season.</p>\n<p>The home-field advantage the Gauchos used to have seems to have dissipated as they have now lost three of their last four home games.</p>\n<p>As the season nears its end, UCSB has to figure out its issue of poor play soon or its once promising season will end in a disappointing fashion.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against UCLA at Jackie Robinson Stadium on Tuesday, May 16 at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

She took the victory in the event she owns the UCSB record in, the 1500m race, as well as taking third place in the 800m run.</p>\n<p>In the 800m race, Tsolis finished in 2:12.36, and she was joined by sophomore Jade Fuller in sixth with a 2:14.90 and junior Kaitlin Large in seventh with a 2:16.16.</p>\n<p>Tsolis finished the 1500m race in 4:20.53 and was joined this time by sophomore Jenna Hinkle and freshman Sabrina Janes, who took fourth and fifth in 4:26.13 and 4:35.00.</p>\n<p>In non-running events, senior Jessica Emde helped the cause by taking first in the high jump with a leap of 1.79m, and freshman Alivia Schlueter did her part by finishing second in the triple jump with a jump of 12.51m.</p>\n<p>Senior Melissa Rake notably took third in the javelin throw with a heave of 45.93m.</p>\n<p>Select UCSB athletes who have qualified for NCAA regionals will be in action again this Thursday through Saturday, May 26-28 at the University of Kansas’ track.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However the Gauchos cut the lead in the top of the fifth when freshman shortstop Melanie Menor hit an RBI double into left center, bringing home junior outfielder Jacqueline Hinjosa.</p>\n<p>The Titans answered back in the bottom of the fifth with another unearned run on a sacrifice fly and the Titans shut down the UCSB attack the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>In the game, Menor went 2-3 with an RBI and a double. Hinojosa went 1-3 at the plate with a run scored.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s first game, the Gauchos played good softball; they came back from a 3-0 deficit to claim a 4-3 victory, scoring two runs in the third and another in the fifth to tie the score at three.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos took the lead for good in the seventh on a clutch homer with two outs in the inning by Menor.</p>\n<p>Menor was 2-4 on the day with two RBIs and a run scored. Arianna Palomares had a good day as she went 1-3 with two RBI’s. DP Jessica Tetzlaff went 1-2 with two runs scored, while right fielder Jessica Johnston collected two hits and a stolen base.</p>\n<p>Senior Ashley Ludlow started the game for the Gauchos, but lasted only 1.1 innings, giving up three runs (two earned) on three hits and a walk.</p>\n<p>Freshman Veronika Gulvin came on in the second and pitched the final 5.2 innings for the win, giving up no runs and six hits while striking out one. It was big day for Gulvin, as she picked up her eighth win of the season, which is very impressive for such a young pitcher.</p>\n<p>Hoping to extend their winning streak in the second game of Saturday’s double header, the Gauchos were unable to show up with the same intensity and lost to the Titans 7-1 in the season finale.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB was the first to get a run on the board when Clark singled and scored on a throwing error, the Titans tied the score in the bottom of the first and blew it open with four more runs in the second.</p>\n<p>The Titans went on to score two more runs in the game, one in the third and another in the sixth.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could only manage three hits in the game off a trio of Titan pitchers, and Titan reliever Christina Washington pitched two innings to pick up her third win of the season.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitcher Veronika Gulvin took the loss, giving up five runs on four hits, including two home runs. At the plate for the Gauchos, Clark went 1-4 on the day with a run scored. Tetzlaff and catcher Samantha Stark each went 1-3.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos couldn’t end the season the way they would have liked, they fought hard in every game, never gave up and played with heart. These are traits this team is highly known for and is something that they will no doubt build upon for next year.</p>\n<p>However, this year may not be over as UCSB still has a slight chance to make an appearance in the NCAA tournament. Regardless, this team’s efforts in the 2015-2016 season deserve to be applauded.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, the two-time defending champion came short to No. 1 USC in a nerve-wrecking game that came down to the last six seconds of the match ending 8-7 in favor of the Trojans.</p>\n<p>In the opening game on Friday, Stanford came out ready to dominate the competition, nearly shutting out the Gauchos in the first half.</p>\n<p>The first goal came at the 5:19 mark, which initiated a 3-0 run in the first quarter for the Cardinals. The second period started off the same way, with Stanford controlling the tempo of the match allowing it to score another six goals before the end of the first half.</p>\n<p>Midway through the second quarter, UCSB drew the first exclusion of the game. The Gauchos capitalized on the play and junior utility Miranda Schrader found junior attacker Brenna Thomas on the left wing to put Santa Barbara on the board for the first time.</p>\n<p>However, Stanford’s stout defense restricted UCSB to the lone goal, maintaining its eight-point lead going at halftime by a score of 9-1.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was more favorable for the Gauchos as they seemed more settled and showed glimpses of what got them to the first-round matchup.</p>\n<p>“I think we came down a little bit from the excitement of being here. We found our rhythm and matched their tempo,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense held off the Cardinals in the third quarter, limiting them to only two goals, both of which came toward the end of the period. Then senior utility Samantha Murphy initiated an offensive breakthrough for the Gauchos, in which they outscored the Cardinals 4-3 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Murphy went 2-3 in the game. Her second goal came in the fourth where she faked out the defense by looking one way and sending the shot to the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The other two goals came courtesy of Schrader with a shot from the right side and junior attacker Jenna Solberg, who got the last goal after she stole it and went for the point herself with only six seconds left on the clock. Solberg picked up a team-high of two steals, while senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had one along with six saves.</p>\n<p>“We are excited to be playing here at the NCAA Tournament for the first time,” Kay said. “And we know that today was part of the process in getting experience with the bright lights and everything that comes with playing in the ‘Big Dance,’”</p>\n<p>UCSB faced No. 10 UC San Diego the following day in the consolation bracket. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson led the team with two goals and two assists, but it was not enough to take down the Tritons in a 10-5 loss.</p>\n<p>It was Hudson who opened up the scoring for both teams at the 6:47 mark in the first quarter. From the right wing, she shot to the far post where it was impossible for UCSD’s keeper to reach.</p>\n<p>The Tritons answered immediately, scoring their first goal 38 seconds later on a power play. This was the first of six goals that UCSD would make as a result of its 6-on-5 advantages out of the seven they registered.</p>\n<p>After four consecutive plays in which the Tritons scored, the Gauchos were able to break the 4-0 run in the second quarter with a steal from Schrader right in front of the cage. The Gauchos counter-attacked, and a pass from Brokaw to Hudson left the attacker in a one-on-one match against the goalkeeper, completing the play and trimming the score to 4-2.</p>\n<p>Yet again, however, the Tritons reacted with another goal of their own to gain a 5-2 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior center Lauren Martin picked up a goal early in the third period after drawing one of her team-high three ejections in the match to make the score 5-3. Despite an early fourth quarter goal by junior utility Taylor Shore and a last-minute goal by Solberg, the Tritons had managed to score three more before the end of the third period ended and two more in the fourth to secure their victory.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, UCSB faced the No. 13 San Diego State Aztecs for seventh place, in which the Gauchos finished their 3-0 season sweep of the Aztecs with an 8-2 win.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the nerves that came with being in the Big Dance seemed to finally disappear for the Gauchos in the final match of their season. The defense shut out the Aztecs in three of the four quarters with the help of Brokaw who collected 10 saves and a steal.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the team worked together to tally eight goals in total, six of them coming in the second half. Martin, Shore and junior defender Sophie Trabucco all recorded a pair of goals.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos did not win the tournament, it was a great learning experience for the younger ones who hope to make an appearance again next year and an unforgettable memory for those that are graduating.</p>\n<p>In one season, they broke several records and completed what no other team in program history had accomplished. A major puzzle piece to that success is the Gauchos’ squad of graduating seniors in First Team All-Big West selections Brokaw, Murphy and Martin. Martin was also named to the Second Team All-Tournament.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, next season looks to be just as promising as the Gauchos will welcome back returning players like Thomas, Shore, Schrader, Solberg, Trabucco and the talent from freshmen Ashley Riley and Sarah Kreiser.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB has been amazing at home this year, boasting a 21-2 record at their home field and having set the school record for most consecutive home victories at 17.</p>\n<p>In the last four games, however, UCSB has ranged from looking average to plain awful.

Only 11 pitchers in UCSB history have reached 10 wins in a season.</p>\n<p>Nelson trails only the two CSUF pitchers in conference ERA with 2.14 and was recently named to the National Pitcher of the Year Watch List.</p>\n<p>Although there is still time left this season, it is certainly crunch time for Santa Barbara.

The Gauchos are set to face the No. 2 Stanford Cardinals in the first round as announced in the NCAA Selection Show the following Monday after Santa Barbara’s title victory.</p>\n<p>The Cardinals, who ended their regular season with a 21-5 overall record, were the runners up this year in the MPSF Tournament. Stanford lost to the top-ranked team in the nation, USC, after a dominating fourth quarter by the Trojans in which they put away five goals, making it difficult for the Cardinals to come back.</p>\n<p>After the decision was announced as to who UCSB would face, it was time to go right back to the drawing board and begin preparing for this weekend.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Stanford faced each other earlier this season in March, ending with the Cardinals prevailing with a crushing 16-5 victory over the Gauchos. While UCSB will enter Friday as the underdog against a powerhouse in Stanford, the Gauchos have shown resilience week after week, having endured just two losses since their loss to Stanford.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the greatest advantage that the Cardinals possess is their postseason experience. But the Gauchos remain determined to keep things afloat with their performance in the pool.</p>\n<p>“Nothing changes for us,” Kay explained. “We will be great competitor’s with the same mindset we had at Big West Championships. [We will continue to] focus on being present and pay attention to the little things.”</p>\n<p>Since the commencement of the NCAA Women’s Water Polo Championship back in 2001, Stanford is the only program to make an appearance every single year. This year, the Cardinals are on the hunt for their fifth national title in the past six seasons and what could be the sixth in program history. Stanford currently reigns as the national champions for the past two consecutive years.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara on the other hand has never been to the “Big Dance” before, but will be guided by the past playing experience of Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>As a four-season starter at UCLA, Coach Kay won three national championships from 1996-2000.</p>\n<p>“This is the same water polo game we have played all season, now we are all just dressed up like prom,” Kay said. “It is important to remember water polo is not rocket science – put the yellow ball in the back of their net and keep it out of ours.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that with Coach Kay in charge of the team anything can be accomplished. In only two short years at UCSB she has helped UCSB claim the Big West Tournament title for the first time ever and also became the first coach in program history to be named Big West Coach of the Year. Most notably, Kay is the first coach not from UC Irvine or Hawai’i to receive the honors.</p>\n<p>To add on to the list of records, this year five Gauchos were named to the All Big-West team, three of them to the First team.</p>\n<p>UCSB had just four other honorees over a span of seven years. The three players that received the First team accolades are the Gauchos’ group of seniors in center Lauren Martin, utility Samantha Murphy and goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson managed to move up from her honorable mention honor last season to Second team this year, and junior utility Taylor Shore received honorable mention for the first time.</p>\n<p>Helping guide Santa Barbara to its conference title victory was the outstanding play of Murphy, who was also named the tournament’s MVP after recording three hat tricks in three-straight matches and a record nine goals. She also finished second on the team with 72 points, 40 goals, 32 assists, and 36 steals.</p>\n<p>Not all her accomplishments are in the pool though. The San Jose native was recently named the 2015 Big West Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</p>\n<p>Another strong force in the paint for UCSB is a two time Big West Player of the Week recipient in Martin,who finished her senior season strong after coming off the bench. She led the team in scoring with a team-high of 49 goals and an impressive .505 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Complementing the Gauchos’ potent offense was their stout defense as well. Fortunately for the Gauchos,  they had Brokaw defending the cage. The fourth-year goalie registered 267 saves this season, 60 more than the second best finish on the team, averaging 8.9 per game.  Going into this weekend, she is only 10 short from moving up one spot to third on the All-Gaucho list.</p>\n<p>“I expect us to continue to ride the wave we are on – with a championship mindset, having each others back, and competing in every minute and every second of the game no matter what,” said Coach Kay on the team’s expectations this weekend.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will take place at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center beginning Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15. UCSB is set to face Stanford at 1:45 p.m.</p>\n<p>The winner of Friday’s match will advance to a Saturday semifinal against the victor of the tournament’s first game between UCLA and either UC San Diego or Whittier. Those two will meet in one play-in, while the other will pit San Diego State against Wagner.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 12, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/","id":4997,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4996,4995,4994],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hopes To Sting Yellow Jackets in First Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering with the confidence from repeating as Big West Tournament champions, the No. 44 UCSB men's tennis team will be back in action this Friday to take on the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets to open th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After capping off the dual match season by sweeping the entire Big West Conference and winning its second-straight Big West Tournament title, the No. 44 UCSB men’s tennis team is not yet finished.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be headed to their second-straight NCAA Tournament and are set to face No. 32 Georgia Tech this Friday in Los Angeles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70851\" style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70851\" data-attachment-id=\"70851\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/ucsb-hopes-to-sting-yellow-jackets-in-first-round/morgan-mays-prepares-to-return-the-ball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Morgan Mays prepares to return the ball.

The Yellow Jackets have been dominant at the upper singles courts, whereas the Gauchos have been tremendous on the lower courts.</p>\n<p>“We’re not intimidated by any team,” Davis said. “We are a better team this year and we are more than capable of reaching the Sweet 16.”</p>\n<p>The match is set to start at 10 a.m. in Los Angeles at David X.

Dubavets and Stojic also went undefeated during the Gauchos BWC title run just a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>The Jayhawks had a tough time during the Big 12 championships, defeating No. 40 Baylor 4-2 in the second round of the conference tournament. In the semifinals, however, Kansas was swept by eventual Big 12 champion No. 12 Oklahoma State. Despite falling short in the semis, Kansas still managed to clinch a No. 2 seed in this year’s NCAAs.</p>\n<p>Set for a fresh sleight after earning its first NCAA Tournament bid in 17 years and led by Head Coach Todd Chapman, who was recently named the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s (ITA) Central Region Coach of the Year on Tuesday, Kansas’ program is revitalized with youthful talent that could potentially achieve an opening round upset.</p>\n<p>Kansas’s standout freshman and the school’s first ever ITA Central Region Freshman of the Year is Anastasiya Rychagova. The young Russian from Moscow is currently ranked 77th in the ITA singles rankings after ending the season with a 15-5 singles and 28-6 doubles record.</p>\n<p>Rychagova has yet to play against other nationally ranked opposition, but that does not mean she has played easy competition. The true freshman has gone to the third set on seven different occasions this season and has gone 3-4 when forced to play three. Rychagova has come into the program without losing a step under Chapman in his third year at the helm.</p>\n<p>Chapman has elevated the program back to the success it has seen in years past, earning an NCAA berth for the first time since 1999, and it was the first time since 2002 that the Jayhawks moved on to the Big 12 semifinals.</p>\n<p>Both teams have the element of a good coach in common with each other. With Head Coach Simon Thibodeau at the forefront of the Santa Barbara program, the Gauchos have not only earned a spot at the NCAAs, but have also claimed a Big West Conference title along the way.</p>\n<p>The Jayhawks and the Gauchos will play this Friday, May 13 at Cal’s Hellman Tennis Complex at 10 a.m. The winner will advance to the next round and face the winner of No. 1 Cal versus the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70878\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70878\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/","id":84,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[83,82,81],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Closes Season Against Big West Frontrunner","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos face-off against the top team in the Big West, Cal State Fulerton, to end the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Preparing to enter its final regular season series, the UCSB softball team will be on the road to face Big West regular season champion Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70852\" style=\"width: 348px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70852\" data-attachment-id=\"70852\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/ucsb-closes-season-against-big-west-frontrunner/jessica-johnston-swings-at-a-perfect-pitch-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jessica Johnston swings at a perfect pitch.

UCSB will enter the series with a team batting average of .307, while also limiting opponents to a .287 hitting clip.

The Titans have scored 281 runs this season, and have an on base percentage of .381 and a slugging percentage of .441.</p>\n<p>Helping hold down the Titans’ infield defense is senior infielder Missy Taukeiho, who owns current team-highs in batting average at .362 and runs scored with 48. Taukeiho also leads in RBIs with a total of 34. She will be a huge threat at the plate with her powerful swing and speed. She also carries a solid on base percentage of .495 and a slugging percentage of .678.</p>\n<p>Titan sophomore outfielder Samantha Vandiver is another top tier hitter in Fullerton’s batting lineup with a .333 average. Vandiver has scored 44 runs this season, a .378 on base percentage and a slugging percentage of .383.</p>\n<p>The Titans also have a strong pitching staff, led by their two starting pitchers, senior Desiree Ybarra and freshman Sydney Golden. Together, the two have given up only 66 earned runs in 262.2 innings pitched. Ybarra has been stellar with an outstanding ERA of 1.84 with 127 strikeouts in 144.1 innings.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos will look to challenge each pitchers’ aim within the strike zone with hitters of their own.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s .307 hitting clip narrowly edges the Titans’ .303 batting average, the Gauchos may be able to overpower the Titans with players such as junior outfielder Kristen Clark and sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston.</p>\n<p>The team’s top two contributors most recently, Clark will begin the weekend with an on-base percentage of .471 and a slugging percentage of .462. Johnston also has good numbers with a .417 on base percentage and a .439 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, senior infielder Arianna Palomares has made her way to the top of the lineup with her 30 runs scored and 35 RBIs this season. Palomares has tallied 10 doubles this season along with Johnston, and is hitting .308 average with a .419 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Aside from Ludlow, freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin may see some time on the mound this weekend as well. She has already gained quite a bit of experience as a freshman, pitching a total of 105.2 innings this season while giving up 52 earned runs on 115 hits.</p>\n<p>This final series on the road against the Titans will be a matchup of two quality squads. The two teams will face each other this Friday at 6 p.m., and will play a double-header on Saturday with the first game at 2 p.m. and a finale scheduled for 4 p.m.</p><div

track career in the blink of an eye, and has now come back just two years later to rewrite the Gauchos’ record books in her favorite event, the 1500m. And she’s not done yet.</p>\n<p>Tori came into the UCSB track program five years ago as the fastest recruit of her year with some very impressive credentials out of Presentation High School in San Jose.</p>\n<p>She was MVP of her high school squad all four years, and she ran the most competitive time of her Gaucho class at the California state finals her senior year, placing 13th in the 800m with a time of 2:12.82.</p>\n<p>When asked why she chose Santa Barbara, she immediately said “beach.” However, while the location of the school is undoubtedly a huge pull for recruits, for her, this was just one reason among countless others of why she chose to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“It was just a switch, like ‘I belong here.’ Everyone seemed really hardworking, and [it seemed like] an everyone’s-there-for-each-other kind of thing,” Tsolis said. “The day after my recruiting trip, I got home and I called [Head Coach] Pete [Dolan] and was like, ‘I want in.’”</p>\n<p>The star runner earned a scholarship eventually with her performance at state finals, but she still accepted less for the opportunity to study and compete at her dream school.</p>\n<p>“I could have gone to a different school and gotten a lot more money, but I just liked it here so much, and it’s paid off,” said Tsolis. “And I feel like I’m a pretty good recruiting investment, if you ask me.”</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Head Coach Pete Dolan would agree on that point now, after all the success the two have enjoyed together. But this was not always so clear-cut.</p>\n<p>Before Tori even started her first year of school at UCSB, she got off to a rocky start. She came in and got injured in just the first couple weeks of cross country training over the summer before freshman year, forcing her out of cross competition that season.</p>\n<p>Then track season came around, and it didn’t go very well. She didn’t PR in the 800, and although she did have a PR in the 1500, she now knows that even that time was nowhere near her potential.</p>\n<p>As if her underperformance wasn’t discouraging enough, right before the conference finals, Tori suffered a back injury that prevented her from participating in the conference event and set her back for her sophomore year cross season as well.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the injuries continued as she endured a stress fracture, forcing her out of competition for the entirety of the season.</p>\n<p>“This was just a very low point in my running career here … I just didn’t even have to go to practice, and I was making all these new friends, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it anymore,” Tsolis explained.</p>\n<p>As Tori started to get healthy again that summer, Dolan was getting frustrated with how things seemed to be turning out.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking she’s just kind of becoming a rec runner. She can run [at this point], but she wasn’t really training, just running,” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>Eventually what got Tori back on track, both literally and figuratively, was some much-needed prodding from a friend and teammate who just graduated last year.</p>\n<p>“Her teammate, Dani Moreno gets the credit,” said Dolan. “Dani Moreno still believed in her and said, ‘If you still want to do this, you’ve got to get after it.’”</p>\n<p>Then, right before her junior year track season, Dolan told her with two weeks notice that she needed to do a two-mile time trial to stay on the team. To make things even more difficult, he gave her no target time to hit.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘You’ve just got to impress me, Tori. C’mon, you’ve got good credentials in high school. Just impress me.’”</p>\n<p>Tori trained as best she could, and with the help of Moreno pacing her at the start, she was able to run 11:06 to impress Dolan and keep her spot on the team.</p>\n<p>“That was the point when I was like, ‘OK, I can’t give up,’” said Tsolis. “That was when I was like, ‘If I do this well, I’m going to stay on the team and keep running, and if I don’t then I’m going to be done with my running career at UCSB.’”</p>\n<p>Since the time trial, Tori has been able to stay relatively healthy for the rest of her career while consistently pushing herself in her training.</p>\n<p>She began chipping away at her times as soon as she returned to the track her junior season, working hard to get back into it.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting her to run that fast ’cause it was her first real season back, [but] it got better and better and, most of the time, I was just shaking my head and going, ‘I can’t believe she’s running this fast,’” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>It all goes back to what Dolan said prior to the time trial: “Impress me.” Now, she impresses him all the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70854\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1809397136\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70875\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70854\" data-attachment-id=\"70854\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/courtesy-of-tori-tsolis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=1040%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1040,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70854\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=294%2C453\" alt=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" width=\"294\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1 163w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1182&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Tori Tsolis</em></p></div>\n<p>Tsolis made it to the first round of regionals that junior year. Then in her senior year in 2015, she was able to advance to the second race of the first round, moving up to No. 2 on the UCSB all-time list in the 1500m in the process.</p>\n<p>This season, she finally broke the 11-year-old school record in the 1500m with a 4:19.02 at the Mt. Sac College Invite a few weekends ago.</p>\n<p>“I was ninth in my race, so I just stood there watching [the clock] go by each one. I’m like, ‘Come on, what did I run?’” Tsolis said. “And then I saw it, and I just tried to find my coach in the stands and I was like, ‘I did it!’”</p>\n<p>As the team works through postseason play now, Tori is looking to make it to nationals and become an All-American this year. She also hopes she can help her team to a top-three finish in the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>“That’s where I’m looking right now,” said Tsolis. “It sounded ambitious going into the year, but now it’s more tangible, I think.”</p>\n<p>Dolan knows Tori is already in the upper echelon of athletes he has had the chance to coach, but if she reaches these goals, he knows she will forever cement her legacy at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“That last race at Mt. Sac (where she beat the UCSB record in the 1500), it was off the charts,” Dolan said. “My heart’s pumping, I’m going, ‘Wow, she’s doing it. She is right there with the best in the country.’ So I’m just staying with that.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Tsolis’ commitment has influenced one of the other two Toris on UCSB’s women’s team, junior decathlete Tori Usgaard, who says she has always looked up to the elder Tori for her mindset and work ethic.</p>\n<p>“Every time you see her work out, she’s always pushing herself to be front of the pack. I think that’s the biggest thing, that she proves to everyone else that hard work pays off,” Usgaard said. “[She’s proof] that it takes time, but you have to trust the process and it’ll all come through eventually.”</p>\n<p>Tsolis is happy to focus this much time and energy on her training because of how rewarding it is for her to see the results.</p>\n<p>“It’s like you get out of it what you put into it, and I spend so many hours practicing. I’m on the bike, I’m on the elliptical, I’m in the pool,” Tsolis said. “[All] because I can’t run as much as I want to because I get injured easily. So I’m just doing weights and everything to stay healthy and injury-free, and it’s so rewarding now that everything has come together.”</p>\n<p>Tori also points to the endless support and understanding of her lifestyle from her family and friends as a huge influence that pushes her and keeps her going. Her dad in particular has been trying to fly down from San Jose to watch all her races this year.</p>\n<p>“I feel bad, but he’s like, ‘It makes me really happy to see you race!’” said Tsolis. “I’m like, ‘I only race for like four minutes!’”</p>\n<p>Tori has had an incredible track career for someone who almost faded out of the sport altogether halfway through college.</p>\n<p>It only makes it more impressive that she’s now training and competing at her highest level ever at the same time as going through an intensive master’s program in economics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 12, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/","id":3305,"author":{"id":318,"name":"Duncan MacPhee"},"related":[3304,3303,3302],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Doomed by Lackluster Performance at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Baseball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Baseball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's 17-game home winning streak is no more after squandering a 3-0 lead heading into the eighth inning and losing to Cal State Bakersfield.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UC Santa Barbara baseball team has now hit its new low of the season after losing to Cal State Bakersfield 5-4 at home yesterday, squandering its school record 17-game home winning streak.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70787\" style=\"width: 528px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70787\" data-attachment-id=\"70787\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/gauchos-doomed-by-lackluster-performance-at-home/joe-record-pitches-a-curveball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Baseball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Joe Record pitches a curveball.

The CSUB Roadrunners improve to 12-34 on the season and have won their last three games, their longest streak of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For Santa Barbara, this loss is a bad one. Not only was it a loss to a much inferior opponent, but it came at a time when the team is struggling to keep the national spotlight as it has dropped out of the D1 Baseball Top 25 National Rankings.</p>\n<p>The loss is also made worse by the team’s lackluster performance. UCSB blew a 3-0 lead heading into the eighth inning and a 4-3 lead going into the final frame.</p>\n<p>Not only that but the Gauchos left 11 runners on base including six in scoring position. They only mustered in one run in the second and third innings combined after having the bases loaded in both of those frames.</p>\n<p>Combine that with two errors that proved to be costly, base-running mistakes and simple misplays of the baseball and one can easily see that UCSB deserved to lose Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were coming off a tough series against UC Davis, but were back at home where they had won 17 straight games and boasted a 21-1 record, so it was not a far-fetched idea to think they could win this game easily.</p>\n<p>UCSB started the scoring in the third inning thanks to redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno’s sac-fly RBI that scored redshirt junior Andrew Calica to take a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the fourth inning, Santa Barbara again added one run to extend its lead to 2-0 after redshirt freshman catcher Thomas Rowan hit an RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the fifth frame, sophomore first baseman Austin Bush hit his sixth home run of the season, a team high, which scored one run to make the score 3-0 after five.</p>\n<p>The combination of pitchers James Carter (a redshirt junior), Kevin Chandler (a freshman) and Justin Kelly (a redshirt senior) was phenomenal for the first seven innings as the three combined to allow just three hits, two walks, four strikeouts and, most importantly, no runs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the eighth inning, left-handed pitcher Kyle Hatton was called on to continue the momentum. However, the moment seemed too much for the freshman as he gave up three runs — two earned — as CSUB tied the game after the top of the eighth.</p>\n<p>“You know, in hindsight I probably should’ve kept [Justin] Kelly in for a little while longer,” Checketts said. “I think I was thinking about saving him for this weekend and that might’ve been a mistake.”</p>\n<p>After an error by the Gauchos, and with Hatton hitting the next batter, the Roadrunners had two runners on base with no outs. Senior Chance Gusbeth then made UCSB pay by hitting a two-RBI triple to left field, encroaching on UCSB’s 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt then came on to pitch, but he did not fare any better as the next batter, junior infielder Ryan Grotjohn, hit an RBI single scoring Gusbeth and tying the game at three.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth inning, UCSB seemed to wake up as it managed to retake the lead at 4-3 thanks to freshman catcher Sam Cohen, who came in as a sub for Rowan and hit an RBI single to score shortstop Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a chance to put Bakersfield away for good, but instead Bettancourt gave up four hits and two runs giving the Roadrunners their first lead of the game at 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was again Gusbeth and Grotjohn who made the key plays as the senior hit a sac-fly RBI to tie the game and the junior hit the game-winning RBI single.</p>\n<p>Grotjohn hit the ball right to Bush, the first baseman, who misplayed it and was unable to get the final out of the inning, which would’ve have left the game tied at four but instead gave Bakersfield the lead.</p>\n<p>“We just played bad. We walk three guys, hit two guys,” Checketts said. “We can’t catch [the ball], the quality of the at-bats are not great. Just bad effort.”</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the final frame, the Gauchos had their chance to tie and it came down to junior utility Billy Fredrick to get the tying runner, who was on second, home.</p>\n<p>Fredrick hit a beautiful line drive to the right side of the infield but CSUB first baseman Cody White made an amazing diving catch for the final out to seal his team’s 12<span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;\">th</span> victory of the season.</p>\n<p>It was truly an off-day for an often on-point Gaucho team. This loss could either be the beginning of two tales for the young UCSB team. Either this team wakes up and starts playing with the fire it showed early in the season or it could squander its promising start.</p>\n<p>Either way, the answer will come very soon as Santa Barbara’s next series is at home against the top team in the Big West standings and reigning champions Cal State Fullerton this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Multiple Gauchos had big hits including senior catcher Samantha Stark and freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer who each had a home run.</p>\n<p>Stark went 2-2 on the day with two RBIs and two runs scored. She also walked twice and was on base four times. Altmeyer also went 2-2 with a triple to go along with her home run. She had three RBIs on the day with a run scored.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer’s home run in the second inning put the first run on the board for the Gauchos, setting the tone for the remainder of the game as they scored in the second, third, fifth and seventh innings.</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Altmeyer has had an incredible season so far, as she leads the team in multiple offensive categories and is second in the Big West conference with 41 runs batted in.</p>\n<p>Senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow saw herself a day, as she earned her 10th win this season allowing only four hits and just one earned run in four innings.</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies made her work, for Ludlow threw 106 pitches in the game, striking out three and walking five.</p>\n<p>In the second game of the day, the Gauchos broke out with three big runs in the first inning on three hits, highlighted by RBI singles from Stark and Altmeyer and a sacrifice fly from sophomore right fielder Jessica Johnston.</p>\n<p>Both teams went scoreless until the fifth when the Aggies tied the score on a one-out three-run homer from junior catcher Katie Robertson.</p>\n<p>Then in the fifth, the Gauchos took the lead for good when junior infielder Emily Brucelas homered to lead off the inning, putting the Gauchos ahead by one.</p>\n<p>In the top of the seventh, Altmeyer added some insurance with her second homer of the day — a blast to deep left centerfield — putting the score at 5-3.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, that was the winning run as the Aggies rallied for a run in the bottom of the seventh but came up short as they lost 5-4.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Ashley Wright started the game for the Gauchos and pitched five innings for her third win of the season.</p>\n<p>She gave up four hits and three earned runs while striking out two. Ludlow came on in the sixth to close out the game and only allowed one hit.</p>\n<p>In the third game on Sunday, UCSB banged out 13 hits to help seal the sweep the Aggies with a 6-4 victory. Johnston went 3-4 on the day, while junior outfielder Kristen Clark, Altmeyer, Brucelas and Stark each collected two hits apiece.</p>\n<p>Ludlow started the game for the Gauchos, giving up two earned runs on six hits in four innings, while striking out four and walking two.</p>\n<p>Wright came on in the fifth to pick up her fourth win of the season and freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin closed out the game with 1.2 innings of relief to pick up her first save this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will prepare to face Cal State Fullerton next weekend for its final series of the regular season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Normally, after winning Saturday’s game, you would expect UCSB to come out firing. However, this was not the case.</p>\n<p>The Aggies beat the Gauchos on their Davis home grass 13-3, administering the second worst loss of the season to their opponents and outhitting them 17-6 over the course of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB started strong, taking a 2-0 lead after the top of the second inning thanks to redshirt sophomore JJ Muno earning an RBI single and later scoring a run himself.</p>\n<p>The Aggies roared back in the bottom half of the frame, scoring four runs, two of which came from sophomore Brad Pluschkell’s two-RBI double down the left field line.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless third from both teams, UC Davis went on to score two runs in the fourth, two in the fifth, three in the sixth and two in the seventh to take a commanding 13-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added one measly run in the top of the eighth to make it 13-3, but it was not nearly enough to dig themselves out of the huge deficit they faced.</p>\n<p>UC Davis had many big hitters over the course of this game, including freshman Logan Denholm, who went 3-5 (.600) and finished with four RBI, two runs and one big, two-shot home run in the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>Senior Tanner Bily had a perfect hitting day, going 3-3 with two runs scored and an RBI. Sophomores Pluschkell and Justin Allen had an identical night, both going 3-5 (.600) on the day and scoring two runs and batting in two.</p>\n<p>Freshman Kyle Hatton (3-1) had a tough outing for the Gauchos. The left-handed pitcher picked up his first loss of the season after allowing four hits and four runs in 1.1 innings.</p>\n<p>Relieving sophomore pitchers Kyle Nelson and Kenny Chapman did not fare any better, combining to allow 12 hits and nine runs, eight of which were earned runs, in only 4.2 innings.</p>\n<p>Only one UCSB hitter, redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford, registered more than one hit on the evening.</p>\n<p>Before Sunday’s terrible blowout, Santa Barbara managed to tie the series at one after defeating UC Davis 7-3 in a game that was pushed back two hours past the original start time due to rainy conditions.</p>\n<p>Once the game commenced, the Aggies looked ready to play, taking an early 1-0 lead after freshman Alex Roeser was walked on with the bases loaded, picking up an RBI. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Joe Record forced the next batter into a fielder’s choice to stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p>After the teams traded two scoreless innings, the Gauchos went off in the fourth inning, scoring four runs to take a 4-1 lead. Redshirt juniors Ryan Cumberland and Andrew Calica both hit RBI fly outs while freshmen Michael McAdoo and Thomas Rowan hit RBI singles.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara added a run in the top of the sixth which UC Davis quickly countered in the bottom half of the frame with a run of its own to make the score 5-2.</p>\n<p>Freshman Caleb van Blake hit a sac fly in the bottom of the eighth inning for UC Davis to cut the lead to 5-3 and give his team some hope down the final stretch.</p>\n<p>However, sophomore Austin Bush put the game away in the top of the ninth inning, blasting a two-run homer to right field and ending the game at 7-3 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>The home run by Bush, the team’s first baseman, was his fifth of the season and now is the new team high. It was the sophomore’s only hit of the day, but it was a big one.</p>\n<p>Record (5-4) was able to pick up his fifth win of the season after going six innings and allowing only one earned run while striking out seven batters. Nelson picked up his team-high fifth save of the season.</p>\n<p>Before evening up the series, Santa Barbara struggled to stop UC Davis in the final two innings of the first game, leading to its eventual 6-2 loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked fine in the first innings, especially in the second when they scored two runs thanks to sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI single and Calica’s RBI walk to take the early 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the next four innings neither team scored, meaning UCSB kept its 2-0 advantage. Junior pitcher Shane Bieber was great throughout the first six innings, allowing only three hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>It looked as though the pitcher was going to cruise into his career-high and Big West-high ninth victory until the bottom of the seventh, when UC Davis rallied three runs off three hits to take a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were unable to retaliate in the top of the eighth, which meant the Aggies could extend their lead in the bottom half.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettencourt pitched only 0.1 innings but allowed three hits and three more runs to UC Davis, which put them up 6-2 after eighth and it was enough to seal its victory.</p>\n<p>Senior Spencer Henderson played a big role in both those innings, earning his team’s first run of the day after an RBI double which scored Denholm and the team’s last run after an RBI single which also scored Denholm.</p>\n<p>The left-handed pitcher/first baseman went 3-4 (.750) on the day with two RBI and one run scored. Denholm went 2-4 (.500) with two runs scored.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos road woes keep plaguing them this season as 11 of the team’s 12 losses have been away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Its road record is now 7-11-1 on the season, the fourth worst in the Big West.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that UCSB is a contender and a tough opponent, but as some point it will need to prove it can win on the road on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Regionals, Super Regionals and College World Series will not be held at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium, so in order for this team to be as successful as it wants to be it must be able to go on the road and win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game is Tuesday, May 10 against CSU Bakersfield at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
