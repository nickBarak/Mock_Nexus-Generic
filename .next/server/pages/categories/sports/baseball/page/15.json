In just his second season as head coach, Andrew Checketts has guided his team into the playoffs. The Gauchos made a major push in the final two months of the regular season to capture a tie for second place in the Big West and earn a bid in the 64-team NCAA Baseball Championship.</p>\n<p>“This is kind of like a dream come true,” senior third baseman Marc Venning said. “I transferred from University of Arizona two years ago and they won the National Championship the year after I left, so I’ve had to live with that. I’ve always wanted a taste of Regionals, so this is like a dream come true and I wouldn’t go back and change this for anything.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who enter the tournament at 34-23, received an at-large selection to participate in the Corvallis Regional hosted by the Pac-12 winner Oregon State, who finished the year 45-10. On the road in neutral ground, UCSB will take on Texas A&amp;M in the first game of the round.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We are just going to get ready to play like we would any other weekend and get ready for Texas A&amp;M,” Checketts said. “This should be fun because going up there is my alma mater and my boss Mark Massari’s last job was with Oregon State, so this should be a lot of fun; there is a lot of family up there.”</p>\n<p>At 32-27 and 13-16 in the SEC, the Aggies enter the regional as the second-seeded team behind Oregon State. The Gauchos are the third-seeded team above University of Texas at San Antonio from the Western Athletic Conference.</p>\n<p>The Regional will take place in double elimination format, with games ending June 3 before the Super Regional hosts are announced.</p>\n<p>The two teams head into this regional tournament riding very different ends to their seasons. The Gauchos have won their last six weekend series in a row with the last being a sweep of UC Davis to help push them into the postseason.</p>\n<p>The Aggies, however, scuffled with the end of their schedule losing five straight games from April 20-27. However, a 7-3 record in May gave them the final push they would need.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M heads to Oregon having just played in their first ever SEC Tournament. The Aggies went 2-2 over their four games in Alabama, starting off hot with two wins, including one against No. 1 seeded Vanderbilt, but eventually dropped two in a row for elimination.</p>\n<p>The two teams are likely to throw their aces at one another to take game one of the tournament. That means UCSB will put sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone on the bump. Pettibone has been the workhorse of the Gaucho staff and of the Big West conference. He has thrown 110 innings this season, the most in the Big West, and has a 9-3 record. The right hander has thrown at least eight innings in his last three starts.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M is likely to throw sophomore Daniel Mengden on Friday. The right-hander from Houston holds an 8-4 record on the season with a 1.84 ERA in 15 starts this year. Mengden has thrown nearly 50 more innings than any other pitcher on the Aggies staff, as he too has cleared the 100 innings pitched plateau.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies are set to kick off the Corvallis Regional with a noon game scheduled at Goss Stadium, the home of Oregon State in Corvallis. Following their game will be UT San Antonio and Oregon State at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version o this article appeared on page 1 of May 30, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.<br>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/","id":4688,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4687,4686,4685],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Davis, Secures NCAA Tournament Bid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_Magali-Gauthier_05.28.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_Magali-Gauthier_05.28.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the final series of the 2013 regular season, the UCSB baseball team executed exactly what was needed to make their final playoff push.

The sweep secured the Gauchos second place in the Big West Conference and on Monday morning, they were voted into the NCAA Baseball Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We are excited about the playoffs,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We were on pins and needles going into the selection show. It didn’t go quite how we expected. It felt like we were deserving and a team that could do some damage. It felt like we should get in there but with our RPI so low we were nervous.”</p>\n<p>The sweep moved the Gauchos to 34-23 overall and into a tie for second place in the Big West Conference with Cal Poly at 17-10 in conference play. UC Davis fell to 19-37 and 5-22 in the Big West, finishing in last place this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In game one of the three game series on Thursday against the Aggies, the Gaucho offense exploded for 10 runs and 14 hits to defeat Davis 10-5. Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward had himself a day as he led the charge, going 4-4 with four runs batted in and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Senior third baseman Marc Venning and freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic each had a couple hits and had two RBI each in the 10 run outburst.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been hitting the ball real well the last couple of weeks in my opinion,” Venning said. “We had a lot of runners on base but we didn’t always score them but we just kept pounding away and eventually we ended up scoring some runs. We executed a lot better in the first two games which led to us putting up a bunch of runs.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone completed his final start of the regular season by throwing eight innings. He earned his ninth win as he allowed four runs and struck out four. Pettibone ends the regular season as the Big West Conference leader in innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Game two of the weekend series was another trouncing of the Aggies as the Gaucho offense continued to fire on all cylinders. UCSB scored eight runs on 15 hits in the 8-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Joey Epperson was the spark plug from the leadoff position, reaching base five times as he went 4-4 on the day with a hit by pitch, two doubles, an RBI, three runs scored and two stolen bases.</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa took advantage of the teams on base ability as they each drove in two runs.</p>\n<p>Woodward left game two with a knee injury and sat out of Saturday’s finale but should be able to play going forward.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Davis slowed down the Gaucho high flying offense but was unable to stop them from completing the three-game sweep. Sophomore Andrew Vasquez pitched just two and two thirds innings before being relieved by sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle, who earned his seventh win of the year with his five and a third shutout innings.</p>\n<p>Filling in for the injured Woodward, freshman second baseman Ryan Clark made sure there was nothing lost as he drove in three runs on Saturday, a career-high.</p>\n<p>After five innings, the two teams were tied 3-3, but Kuresa put the Gauchos on top with a solo home run, his fifth of the year, to give his team a lead that would be held by freshman pitcher Dylan Hecht‘s eighth and final save of the regular season.</p>\n<p>This will be the Gauchos’ first postseason since 2001.

Coming off a loss on Tuesday night against No. 8 UCLA, the Gauchos likely need a sweep of UC Davis this weekend as well as teams like Cal Poly and Northridge to lose.</p>\n<p>UC Davis comes into this game riding a three-game losing streak after being swept by Hawaii just this last weekend. The sweep has left Davis with a 19-34 overall record and in last place in the Big West at 5-19.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, despite Tuesday’s loss, have been playing very well. Having won their last five weekend series against Big West opponents, they have climbed into a tie for fourth place at 31-23 and 14-10 in the Big West. Cal Poly and CSUN are in a tie for second with just a one-game lead over UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Northridge will take on first-place Cal State Fullerton this weekend, which should work out well for the Gauchos. Cal Poly takes on a struggling Pacific team that was able to edge a win from UCSB last week, so if the Tigers can do the same this weekend, a sweep of Davis will set the Gauchos for a playoff chance.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will rely on the strength of their starting pitchers. In seven of the last nine games, UCSB starters have thrown quality starts, which is six innings of allowing just three earned runs or less. Tuesday’s starter, freshman Justin Jacome, just missed qualifying as he needed one more out. He still pitched five-and-two-thirds innings, allowing just two runs to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“Everything is going to stay the same,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We have had a lot of really good starts in a row going back with like six or seven quality starts in a row, so hopefully those guys continue to do that.”</p>\n<p>The weekend starters for the Gauchos have been stellar lately. Friday’s starter sophomore Austin Pettibone has thrown 17 innings over his last two starts and has allowed just two runs in that period.</p>\n<p>On the year, Pettibone sits with an 8-3 record and 3.00 ERA. He leads the Big West Conference with 102 innings pitched and is the only pitcher to have reached the 100 inning plateau so far this season.</p>\n<p>Through the struggles this season, Davis has had some players stand out this year. Sophomore designated hitter Nick Lynch ranks third in the Big West with a .361 batting average this season. Thanks to his high average and knack for getting hit by pitches, a Big West-high 20, Lynch is also third in the conference with an on-base percentage of .444.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outfielder Tino Lipson has scored the second-most runs for the Aggies with 30, thanks to his .340 batting average. Lipson also boasts an OBP of over .400. With runners aboard quite often, sophomore John Williams finds himself in very productive positions and ranks eighth in the Big West with his 38 RBI on the season.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Aggies have the highest batting average and the second-most runs scored in the Big West; however, the reason the team finds itself in the cellar of the conference is due to their inability to pitch effectively.</p>\n<p>The UC Davis pitching staff has given up the second-most hits, the second-most runs and allowed the most walks. The Gaucho offense that has only been tamed recently by the Bruins will have a chance to take advantage of every base runner allowed this series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies will lock up this Thursday and Friday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. On Saturday, the two teams will round out the regular season at 1 p.m. at Dobbins Stadium in Davis.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of May 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51541\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/51541/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51541\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/51541/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/51541/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/51541/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/51541/","id":4687,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4686,4685,4684],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Close Game to No. 8 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8441.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8441.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team’s prospects of making the postseason have seemingly disappeared with Tuesday night’s loss to No. 8 UCLA, 2-1.

We probably have to finish in second [in the Big West] or tie for second which means Cal Poly needs to lose.”</p>\n<p>With the loss, the Gauchos fall to 31-23 and have lost the season series to UCLA 0-2.

Junior left fielder Joey Epperson led off the game by getting hit by a pitch. With the leadoff man aboard, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon executed a sacrifice bunt to move the base runner into scoring position with just one out.</p>\n<p>Number three hitter sophomore Woody Woodward had a productive out as his ground ball to third still managed to advance Epperson to third on the play. With two outs and a runner on third base, sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa did what he does best and drove in the go-ahead run with a base hit into left-center field.</p>\n<p>Before the Gauchos could attempt a two-out rally, however, Kuresa was caught stealing second base to end the inning, and about all the offense the Gauchos would muster all night.</p>\n<p>“We were trying to trick them with a delayed steal,” Checketts said. “We actually had them and it would have worked, but the pitcher missed and the throw was up almost like a pitchout and the catcher was able to see it. I think if it was a different pitch he would have been safe at second.”</p>\n<p>The Bruins would come back to tie the game in the bottom half of the second inning. Junior shortstop Pat Valaika led off the inning with a triple into right-center field. A follow-up single by junior second baseman Kevin Williams would score Valaika and tie the score 1-1.</p>\n<p>Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome worked his way out of the second-inning jam thanks to an inning-ending double play and eventually got locked up in a pitchers duel as both starters settled down after shaky early innings.</p>\n<p>The Bruins freshman starting pitcher Cody Poteet was able to shut down the surging Gaucho offense Tuesday evening. Poteet went six strong innings, allowing just one run on one hit with just one walk and three strikeouts. Jacome pitched strong as well, but was not quite as stellar as he allowed two runs through five and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t get a lot of hits and we didn’t execute,” Checketts said. “We knew it was going to be a low-scoring and detailed game but we weren’t able to get an out on a bunt and that hurt us.

This is the final home game for the Bruins in the regular season, where they are 23-9 on their home field. Despite their stellar record, however, UCLA has lost its last two matchups with Big West opponents.</p>\n<p>On May 7, Cal State Northridge defeated the Bruins in Los Angeles 4-1, and on May 14, Cal State Fullerton, the No. 1 team in the Big West, defeated UCLA 5-2. Excluding those two losses to Big West opponents, UCLA has crushed its competition in the Pac 12 as of late.</p>\n<p>The Bruins have swept their last three series against conference opponents, defeating USC, Arizona and Utah the last three weekends and have gone on to now win six consecutive weekend series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are seemingly just as hot. UCSB has won its last five weekend series with Big West opponents, the last coming against Pacific this last weekend.</p>\n<p>Today in Los Angeles, freshman pitcher Justin Jacome is slated to take the mound. Jacome, in his last outing, returned from a severe ankle sprain and impressed. He threw six-and-a-third strong innings, allowing just one run on seven hits, earning his fifth victory this season.</p>\n<p>“This is a big game for us,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We’ve got Jacome going and probably we will see some of our other regular weekend starters available, too, since it’s like do or die at this point.”</p>\n<p>Backing Jacome will be a Gaucho offense that has found its stride after some lineup tweaks. The supporting cast around standouts junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa have really begun to produce.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Joey Epperson has taken hold of the leadoff position and is hitting .320 since April 16, scoring 18 runs over that 19 game span.</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell, who Epperson replaced at the top of the order, has also thrived moving into the more RBI friendly positions around the five hole. Newell is hitting .425 since April 16 and has driven in 12 runs.</p>\n<p>The new number three hitter in the lineup, sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward, has also seen his production increase. Since April 16, he is hitting .307 with 12 runs scored and 17 RBI.</p>\n<p>Epperson, Newell and Woodward also have all had hitting streaks of 13, 12 and 13 games respectively over the last month, a large reason the team has seen such success as of late.</p>\n<p>The hot-hitting Gauchos will be at Jackie Robinson Stadium tonight with first pitch against UCLA set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1854044175\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51457\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51458\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-21/confident-gauchos-face-no-11-ucla/magali-gauthier-baseball/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg?fit=3456%2C5184&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3456,5184\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1361899973\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"190\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Magali Gauthier Baseball\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51458\" alt=\"Magali Gauthier Baseball\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 21, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Nesovic was touched up for two more runs on a string of singles off both Nesovic and sophomore reliever Greg Mahle.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the inning, the Gauchos scored their first run on an RBI single by Nesovic. In the eighth the Gauchos, who have become notorious in recent weeks for their comebacks, mustered a rally for one run, but junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon bounced into an inning ending double play and the Gauchos fell 3-2.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s home finale, the Gauchos put a seven spot on Pacific. UCSB wasted no time as they put up three runs in the bottom of the first with four consecutive singles.</p>\n<p>With the early lead sophomore starting pitcher Andrew Vasquez settled into one of his best starts of the year. Vasquez threw seven and a third shutout innings with five strikeouts en route to his second victory this season.</p>\n<p>In his home finale, senior third baseman Marc Venning doubled and also drove in a run with a sacrifice fly helping his team to take the victory 7-3.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t ask for anything more,” Venning said. “We needed to win this one; obviously all these games are important now.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be a trip to UCLA on Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page five of May 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/","id":4472,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4471,4470,4469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Know How to Close","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team is in the midst of its busiest week of the season but that does not seem to be slowing the team down any.

Jacome threw six and one-third solid innings, allowing seven hits on just one earned run.</p>\n<p>“Jacome came out for his first appearance since he sprained his ankle pretty bad and didn’t fall behind until the last batter he faced,” senior third baseman Marc Venning said. “He really pounded the strike zone and we got him an early lead. The plan was to let them get themselves out and let our defense work behind him and that’s exactly what he did.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense that walked off with a bunt on Monday stayed white hot as the team put up 11 runs on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>The outburst began in the second inning when Monday’s hero in sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell led off the inning with a single. Newell stole second and was then doubled home by senior third baseman Marc Venning to plate the first run in the three-run inning.</p>\n<p>“I’m not totally healed yet but I wanted to come back and play my last 14 games and finish out my career and help the team out how I can,” Venning said. “We really swung the bats well today and they made a few mistakes defensively but we capitalized on those mistakes and made them pay.”</p>\n<p>Later in the inning, with runners on first and third, junior catcher Jackson Morrow laid down a bunt that was misplayed by LMU’s senior pitcher Matt Florer, which led to Morrow’s first of four RBI on the day. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon grounded into a double play, but the third run would score on the play.</p>\n<p>In the top of the third, the Gauchos would strike for four more runs. With the bases loaded, Morrow singled to score the first two runs of the inning. Morrow’s base hit was followed by an RBI single by junior left fielder Joey Epperson and another misplayed ball off Trinkwon’s bat led to a four-run inning.</p>\n<p>Up 7-0 already, the Gauchos again put a four spot on the Lions. Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa and Newell’s back-to-back singles drove in a run each. Morrow drove in his fourth run of the day with another base hit as he went 2-3 with four RBI and a run scored. Epperson drove in the Gauchos final run with a sac fly to score Venning.</p>\n<p>LMU was able to muster some offense late with a three-run seventh inning. Jacome got into his first bit of trouble allowing a leadoff double. He was then lifted for senior pitcher Jared Wilson, who gave up a single to sophomore catcher Chris Barnett, driving in the Lions’ first run. Two more runs would come around to score before Wilson finished off the inning.</p>\n<p>Wilson worked a scoreless eighth followed by sophomore catcher Campbell Wear’s scoreless ninth to close out the victory 11-3.</p>\n<p>The busy week will continue as the Gauchos will take on Pacific at home this weekend for a three-game series with their fellow Big West combatants. The Tigers head south, tied with UC Davis for last place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Pacific currently sits at 13-34 and 5-16 in conference action. The Tigers have, however, gone 3-3 over their last six outings.</p>\n<p>The Tiger offense is led by senior third baseman Dustin Torchio. Torchio leads Pacific with 54 hits and 25 RBI on the season. On Sunday against UC Davis, Torchio went 3-5 with three runs scored and an RBI in the 10-7 loss.</p>\n<p>On the mound Friday for Pacific will be junior Justin Haberman. Haberman has thrown 61.2 innings this year as he has been the most reliable starter for the Tigers. He currently holds a 5.11 ERA and a 1-5 record but has the ability to throw up some zeros. For his lone win this year Haberman shut down Long Beach State. He threw six inning allowing just one unearned run.</p>\n<p>The three game series will be the final three home games for the Gauchos this season. Venning and Wilson will be playing their final home games of their college careers this weekend and will be honored on the field Sunday for Senior Day.</p>\n<p>Game one is set for a 3 p.m. start on Friday at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium followed by Saturday’s 2 p.m. start. Sunday’s series finale and final home game of the year will be Extravaganza Sunday at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2789.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1565028441\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51414\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51415\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/gauchos-know-how-to-close/markbrocher_baseball_4-19-2013_dsc_2789/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2789.jpg?fit=4800%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4800,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366386275\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2789\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2789.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2789.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51415\" alt=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2789\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2789-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on page 1 and 8 of May 16, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/gauchos-know-how-to-close/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/gauchos-know-how-to-close/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/gauchos-know-how-to-close/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/gauchos-know-how-to-close/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/gauchos-know-how-to-close/","id":4453,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4452,4451,4450],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win In Walk-Off Fashion Again","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos have walked off again.

The UCSB baseball team walked off in the bottom of the ninth inning for the second time in just over a week. Last Sunday, junior left fielder Joey Epperson hit a walk-off home run against UC Irvine and yesterday afternoon sophomore Cameron Newell squeezed in the winning run with a drag bunt to seal a 7-6 victory and establish UCSB as the comeback kids.</p>\n<p>“Coming back is the mark of a good team,” sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa said. “All the good teams I have ever been on have been like this where you just find ways to win. The great thing about this team is you never know who it’s going to be that’s going to step up.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara improves to 28-21 with the victory and remains at 12-9 in the Big West with the nonconference matchup. Washington State falls to 21-27 with the loss, its third in a row as the Cougars have now lost seven of their last eight.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos jumped out to an early lead as they often do at home, scoring a run in the bottom of the first inning. Epperson led off the Gauchos half of the inning with a single, and after he stole second, a two-out single by Kuresa would be all he needed to plate the first run.</p>\n<p>Freshman starting pitcher Domenic Mazza pitched well in his return to the mound after a lengthy absence due to back injuries. Mazza threw six innings and allowed just three runs over his final two innings of work.</p>\n<p>“I thought [Mazza] did really well there,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “He gave up the two at the end when he was a little gassed but he threw well. He did a great job through the first five. He threw a lot of strikes for us.”</p>\n<p>The Washington State bats came alive late as the Cougars were able to tack on six runs from the fifth inning on. Sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle came on in relief for Mazza and worked a scoreless seventh inning before getting touched up for two runs in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic led off the bottom of the eighth with a single and was lifted for a pinch runner. After a sacrifice bunt to move the runner to second, senior third baseman Marc Venning doubled home the tying run to even the score 5-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore shortstop Trace Tam Sing led off the eighth inning with a double and scored on a single by junior catcher Collin Slaybaugh to give WSU the lead.</p>\n<p>Down 6-5 in the bottom of the ninth, the Gauchos returned to the small-ball formula that worked in the eighth. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon got things started with a leadoff single. Another sacrifice bunt moved him into scoring position for Kuresa who drove home his third run of the game to tie it back to 6-6.</p>\n<p>Kuresa was lifted for a pinch runner who was moved to third on a Mahle groundout. With the winning run on third base, Newell laid down a bunt up the third base line to squeeze in the winning run.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, I got a good pitch to bunt and got it down the line,” Newell said. “It was a good team win today. Good job by Dom on the mound and our guys at the plate picking each other up offensively today.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its busy week with a trip to Loyola Marymount for a 3 p.m. game tomorrow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1321126390\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51372\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51375\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/gauchos-win-in-walk-off-fashion-again/markbrocher_baseball_4-19-2013_dsc_2748/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg?fit=4800%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4800,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366385730\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51375\" alt=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 14, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone followed up his season-worst performance of last week with a nine inning gem on Friday.</p>\n<p>“Austin was special [Friday]; he had a good live fastball and commanded the outside half of the plate,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Pettibone pitched a complete game, allowing just one run. Pettibone walked just one and struck out five on the way to his seventh victory of the season.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ sophomore starting pitcher Jerry Keel pitched equally well, throwing eight innings of shutout ball. He, however, was relieved in the ninth inning and the Gauchos put up six runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>The huge inning began with a quick out, but back to back singles began the outburst. Senior third baseman Marc Venning, making his return to the lineup after missing well over a month, was promptly hit by a pitch to load the bases.</p>\n<p>A bases-loaded walk brought home the first run of the game before junior catcher Jackson Morrow plated two runs on a base hit to left field. Another hit batter loaded the bases for junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon, who singled up the middle for two more runs.</p>\n<p>The relief pitching of the Matadors continued to crumble as sophomore Woody Woodward was the third hit batter of the inning. Woodward and Trinkwon then advanced to second and third, respectively, on a passed ball and Trinkwon scored on a wild pitch to complete the six-run inning and seal the 6-1 victory.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB again scored six runs en route to a 6-2 victory. Morrow got aboard with a single in the third and back to back Matador errors led to Morrow scoring the games first run.</p>\n<p>In the top of the fifth inning, junior leftfielder Joey Epperson, who had his 12-game hitting streak snapped in game one, led off the inning with a solo home run. Trinkwon then worked a walk and would come around to score on a single followed by another Matador error.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic doubled home two runs.

Epperson went 8-14, extending his hitting streak to 12 games, with six runs scored, four RBI, a stolen base and a home run. The home run came in the bottom of the ninth with a runner on down by one in Sunday’s series finale with Irvine. Epperson took the first pitch deep against the Anteaters closer. On Friday’s game, Epperson had a four-hit day and was just a home run shy of the cycle.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense has really found its stride as of late. With the pitching staff struggling to stay healthy, the offense has been more than willing to put up as many runs as needed. Three Gauchos have had hitting streaks of nine or more games, with Epperson and Newell at 12 and 11 respectively. Sophomore shortstop Woody Woodward, who sits at nine games, could have been player of the week as he went 5-12 this weekend with five RBI.</p>\n<p>Northridge, however, is second in the league this year as a team in runs scored and RBI. Junior first baseman Josh Goossen-Brown leads the Big West conference with 43 RBI so far this year, as he has established himself as a major threat in the heart of the Matador order.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Miles Williams is also a player to keep an eye on. UCSB will look to keep runners off the bases while he is at the plate, as he has hit seven home runs this year in just 86 at bats.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Matadors set to show down at 3 p.m. on Friday at Matador field. Games two and three will both be at 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1287815177\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51272\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/baseball_magaligauthier-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=3456%2C5184&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3456,5184\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1361900171\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"240\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51273\" alt=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 9, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This season, he has groomed his pitchers into one of the top pitching teams in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>Of the solid group that Checketts has at his disposal, the team’s ace, sophomore Austin Pettibone has truly been impressive. Just two years in to his college career, Pettibone has made a major stamp as one of the top pitchers in the Big West. In his first year he compiled a 4.44 ERA over 79 innings pitched. He made 17 appearances, 13 starts, led the staff with his eight wins and even earned a save.</p>\n<p>“The thing that really stands out about [Austin] is his will to prepare,” Checketts said. “He is committed to preparing and committed to his work ethic and doing things right and so he competes every day. He shows up and competes in the weight room and competes in practice and that translates to him going out every Friday.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This year he has upped his game as he leads the Gauchos with 12 games started, six wins, 85 innings pitched and leads all UCSB starters with a 3.39 ERA. Among the conference, Pettibone has thrown the most innings and sits at seventh with his six wins.</p>\n<p>“His stuff has gotten better,” Checketts said. “He has added about 3-4 miles an hour to his fastball, his change-up has been better, his curveball has improved from where it was and still probably has one more jump to make. He shows it in the bullpen and it hasn’t quite translated to the game yet consistently, but he is really committed.”</p>\n<p>On March 15, Pettibone had himself a career performance, pitching a complete game shutout against Sacramento State. He allowed just four hits and did not walk a batter over the course of the game as well as compiling a season-high six strikeouts to lead the Gauchos to a 5-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“My complete game shutout this year was [a] pretty cool experience,” Pettibone said. “I threw like 79 pitches. Everything was working and everything was going my way, so it was just a really great feeling as a pitcher.”</p>\n<p>Despite his exceptional play so far this season, Austin Pettibone may not even be having the most exciting year of the Pettibone family. On April 22, his older brother Jonathan Pettibone made his first career major league start with the Philadelphia Phillies against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jonathan threw five and a third innings as he struck out six while allowing six hits and just two runs in his debut.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty awesome; I got to go out there when he had his debut out in Philly,” Pettibone said. “It was just a great experience to see him out there and he actually threw pretty well so it was just a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan has continued to pitch well as he has thrown two more games and has earned a win in both — one against the New York Mets and another versus the Miami Marlins. He is also set to pitch tonight against the San Francisco Giants.</p>\n<p>In his three starts in the Major Leagues, Jonathan has earned a 2-0 record and a 3.24 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 16.2 innings. He also has given up just two walks in the three games, something that is a major problem for most young starters as the grand stage has been known to rattle up-and-comers.</p>\n<p>“All the scouts and announcers and whoever always mention his composure on the mound whether things are going his way or if they’re not,” Pettibone said. “He even helped with staying calm in those types of situations. Keeping my composure.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan is perhaps showing himself as a potential big leaguer to stay. With the recent injury to former Cy Young award winner Roy Halladay, Pettibone may just get a chance to lock down a spot in the Phillies‘ rotation.</p>\n<p>Jonathan was drafted in the third round in 2008 by the Phillies and signed out of high school.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool growing up with him in the minor leagues,” Pettibone said. “Watching him grind it out and get better from year to year and get better and get stronger and then finally it paid off and he has got his debut this year. It’s just been cool growing up with that the last five years.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan and Austin’s father Jay had made it to the big leagues in 1983, so with a past of pitching the two young men seemed to have their sights set.</p>\n<p>“Since I was five years old I was throwing the baseball around and playing tee ball,” Pettibone said. “We were all pitchers and I have a cousin that’s a pitcher in high school right now. It’s just been a Pettibone thing to be a pitcher.”</p>\n<p>The two brothers still have a long way to go before the season ends, but they’re certainly set to continue their great years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/","id":4684,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4683,4682,4681],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Final Two Games to Take Third Straight Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8060.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8060.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team won its third conference series in a row this weekend, going 2-1 against UC Irvine.

Every single out he has had has been hit hard,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “That’s the right guy to have at the plate. He does everything right and he is prepared. He absolutely deserved [the walk off] because the way that he has handled himself in the dugout and practice.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, UCSB moves up to 25-20 on the year and 10-8 in the Big West Conference, just one game behind Irvine and Cal Poly for third place. The Anteaters, meanwhile, drop to 29-15 and 11-7 in conference.</p>\n<p>In Fridays game one of the series, the Gauchos pitching staff allowed the most runs they have in a single game all season. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone, who had been lights out as the staff’s ace, was crushed by the Anteaters. He gave up a season high nine runs through just five and a third innings for his shortest outing of the year.</p>\n<p>Both teams were able to put up two runs in the first inning, but the Gauchos scored one in the third and three in the fourth to take a 6-2 lead. UCSB chased junior starting pitcher Andrew Thurman after just four innings of work as he allowed six runs on 10 hits.</p>\n<p>“[Friday] was a weird day because their guy was throwing and he is projected to be a second or third round draft pick and our guy was going and he is a sophomore and not draft eligible but pretty good,” Checketts said. “Both these guys have been leaders in the conference for ERA, so going into it you think it’s going to be a 2-1 ballgame, but they both got roughed up.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did not hold the lead long however, as Irvine returned with a run in the fifth and exploded for seven in the sixth to jump on Pettibone. Three consecutive doubles topped off the inning that was then followed by a four-run seventh.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would go on to score a run in each of the final three innings but would ultimately fall 14-9 in game one.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB bounced back to tie the series with a 5-3 win thanks to a quality spot start by freshman pitcher Robby Nesovic.</p>\n<p>“Against Riverside Justin Jacome rolled his ankle so he is out two to three weeks. He did it covering first and ended up pitching two more innings on it but now the doc has shut him down,” Checketts said. “The freshmen did a good job of picking up the freshman. Nesovic threw enough strikes and was able to battle out of some jams.”</p>\n<p>Not only was Nesovic impressive on the mound, throwing six innings and allowing just three runs, but he also went 3-3 at the plate and helped his own cause with a solo home run in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters were able to tag him for three runs on a home run by senior right fielder Scott Gottschling to tie the game in the top of the sixth, but sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward came back to break the tie in the bottom of the sixth to take the lead and set up freshman pitcher Dylan Hecht’s seventh save which included him striking out the side.</p>\n<p>In the rubber game of the weekend series, the Gauchos sent sophomore Andrew Vasquez to the hill after a successful return last weekend after he had been out for a month. He pitched five and a third innings and allowed three runs on five hits while striking out six.</p>\n<p>“The key point of this game is that we got Andrew Vasquez back and he looked the part,” Checketts said. “He wasn’t perfect, but he sure looked like his old self and maybe a little bit better than his old self. He threw enough strikes and was really good.”</p>\n<p>Epperson led off the bottom of the first with a single and scored the game’s first run on a Woodward single. In the third, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and Woodward each drove in a run to put the Gauchos ahead 3-0.</p>\n<p>Irvine fought back in the fourth on a two-run home run by Gottschling, his second in two days. The Anteaters would then tie the game in the sixth and take the lead in the seventh, a lead they would hold until the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>\n<p>After taking on an insurance run in the top of the ninth UCI led 6-4 with just three outs to go. Red hot sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell singled to lead off the inning and extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Newell stole second and came around to score on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos down by just the one run allowed in the top of the inning, Epperson stepped to the plate with the tying run on first base. Epperson crushed the first pitch he saw to left center field for the walk off two-run home run.</p>\n<p>“Obviously I was just in the right place at the right time and I got rewarded for it,” Epperson said. “My at bat is just a testament to the guys before me putting quality at bats together and that’s what we’re all about. We pass the baton and pick each other up.”</p>\n<p>Coming up next for the Gauchos will be a three-game road series with Cal State Northridge this Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The Matadors currently sit in second place in the Big West, four games ahead of UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of  May 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51195\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51195\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/","id":4683,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4682,4681,4680],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Climb the Big West Standings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier.jpg?resize=480%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  This weekend, the UCSB baseball team will welcome third-place UC Irvine onto its home field for a chance to move into the top of the Big West Conference standings.

So we just need to stay focused and stay healthy.”</p>\n<p>Irvine holds the third-best batting average in the Big West at .286 as a team thanks in large part to sophomore first baseman Connor Spencer and sophomore third baseman Taylor Sparks. Spencer hits 387, which leads the Big West, while Sparks maintains a .345 average.</p>\n<p>However talented the opposing offense may be, the Gaucho pitching staff has showed it is as good as any to shut down the opposition. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone leads the Big West in innings pitched with 79.2, and his 6-2 record and 2.60 ERA are tops among Santa Barbara starters.</p>\n<p>Following up Pettibone has been freshman pitcher Justin Jacome, who has been quite impressive in his own right this season. Jacome has thrown 65 innings en route to a 4-3 record on the season but has struck out 45 in that span. In his last outing against Riverside, Jacome struck out six and allowed just two hits over seven and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s pitching staff has impressed as well this year, however, and will be a tough group for the UCSB offense to conquer. The Anteaters’ pitchers have a team ERA of just 3.18 this year and are second in the Big West at striking out opposing hitters.</p>\n<p>Behind both pitching staffs are some stellar defensive teams. The Anteaters lead the Big West with a .983 fielding percentage while the Gauchos hold perhaps one of the best shortstops in the league in junior Brandon Trinkwon.</p>\n<p>“We obviously need to come out and swing the bats. We have got some guys on the bump that are pretty special so we just need to see strikes and hit strikes,” Trinkwon said. “As far as defense, we just need to play behind our pitchers. We’re pretty good and have home field advantage, so that should help us a little bit. Besides that, we just need to play our game.”</p>\n<p>Over the last couple weeks, the Gauchos offense has really picked up the pace. They have outscored opponents 31-19 over the past four games. Leading the charge has been sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell, who earned Big West Player of the Week honors with his performance over his last four games.</p>\n<p>Newell went 9-14 with four RBI last week, including two three-hit performances. Newell has seen himself drop in the lineup from leadoff into more opportunistic RBI spots as his bat has continued to heat up. Since losing his 12-game hitting streak April 14, Newell has just started a new streak. He has hit safely now in eight games and has driven in at least one run in four of the last eight games.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s series will get under way on Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. First pitch drops back an hour each day as Saturday’s game will begin at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s matchup starts at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/","id":4673,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4672,4671,4670],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Two of Three Against UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  The UCSB baseball team could not complete a weekend sweep for the second week in a row.

Riverside, on the other hand, moves to 18-21 and a 7-8 Big West record. Cal State Fullerton remains on top of the conference at 11-3.</p>\n<p>On Friday, UCSB came away with a victory in a high scoring affair. The Gauchos got things started in the top of the first, scoring four runs on six hits in the inning. Junior outfielder Joey Epperson led the game off with a double. After a sacrifice bunt moved him to third, sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward drove him in for the game’s first run.</p>\n<p>Freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic followed with a double to bring home Woodward to record his first RBI of the night. Nesovic would finish with three hits, three runs and three RBI.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders came back with two runs in the home half of the first as well as three more in the second to take the lead through two. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone allowed five runs, two earned, through seven innings of work to improve to 6-2 on the year.</p>\n<p>Down 5-4, UCSB scored three in the third to retake the lead and another three in the sixth for good measure. Riverside was able to plate two runs in the bottom of the ninth but freshman closer Dylan Hecht would come on and close out the game for his fifth save of the year.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night runs were at a premium as the Gauchos would go on to win 2-0. Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome was lights out as he allowed just two hits and two walks through seven and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>“Jacome really threw the ball well,” Checketts said. “He threw a lot of strikes and had really good fastball command. He did a really nice job.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Ben Doucette was the tough luck loser in that one as he threw seven innings and allowed just one unearned run in the sixth inning for Riverside. The Gauchos would tack on another run on an Epperson single in the eighth before Hecht came on to collect his second save of the weekend.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s finale, Riverside was able to put up five runs in the first inning to take a commanding lead early. Junior starting pitcher Cameron Cuneo allowed five unearned runs through two and two-thirds innings before being relieved by Nesovic in the third.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was able to get one across in the second inning and came to within one after a three-run home run by sophomore Tyler Kuresa in the fifth.</p>\n<p>Nesovic was unable to keep the Highlanders at bay, however, as he allowed three runs in the eighth. In the final at bats for UCSB, Kuresa added an RBI double in the ninth to attempt a comeback but the Gauchos would ultimately fall 8-5.</p>\n<p>Coming up for the Gauchos will be a home series against UC Irvine on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1931207429\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51090\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-29/gauchos-take-two-of-three-against-uc-riverside/markbrocher_baseball_4-19-2013_dsc_2645/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg?fit=4800%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4800,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366385012\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51091\" alt=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 29, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.<br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos had previously lost to USD last week, but blew out the Toreros on the cool and wet afternoon.</p>\n<p>Yesterday was the return of sophomore pitcher Andrew Vasquez, whose last appearance came a month ago on March 24. Vasquez threw three innings, allowing two earned runs on just one hit, but allowed six walks.</p>\n<p>“I think this was a huge step in the right direction for him,” junior catcher Jackson Morrow said. “Obviously from the results it may have not been exactly what he wanted, but we need him going down the road. He is such a talented pitcher and this was awesome to see.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos advance to 21-18 on the season with the win, picked up by junior pitcher Cameron Cuneo who worked four innings of relief. San Diego drops to 25-16 with the loss.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara got on the board first in the bottom of the second, putting a three spot on San Diego. Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa reached base on an error and would come around to score on a single by freshman third baseman Devon Gradford. After Gradford stolen base, Morrow would single in two more runs to start his 3-4 and four-RBI day.</p>\n<p>“They have some good arms and some pretty good guys on the mound, so it was really nice to put some good swings on balls,” Morrow said. “The RBIs just come from guys being in scoring position while I’m at bat, so thanks to those guys for helping me out a lot.”</p>\n<p>San Diego responded with two runs in the top of the third and another in the fifth on junior third baseman Kris Bryant’s home run, his 21st on the season. However, UCSB would score an incredible six runs in the seventh.</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell got the big inning started with a two-run single. Newell then stole second, but a throwing error brought in a run. Another base hit by freshman third baseman Ryan Clark would plate another before a two-run home run by Morrow would top off the inning and his impressive day at the plate.</p>\n<p>“Today I think we played really good team baseball and we have been playing better the last couple weeks,” Morrow said. “We pulled a game out at Fullerton and ever since then we’ve got on a little roll. Now we need to go into [Riverside] and play our brand of baseball.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be a trip to Riverside for a three-game series this weekend. The Highlanders are mired in a five-game losing streak and most recently lost to San Diego on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big weekend for us,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “Personally I’m excited; it’s my first time back as a coach since I coached there. I’ve been back to watch games and see friends, but I haven’t been in the other dugout to coach so I’m excited to see how our guys respond.”</p>\n<p>The five-game slide has included some incredibly one-sided defeats as well. On April 16 against UNLV, Riverside lost 11-24 to start the losing streak. Then on April 21 against UC Davis, they fell 8-19. The Highlander offense has been able to score enough runs to keep them in a typical game, but the pitching staff has been roughed up heavy as of late.</p>\n<p>Yet, the 17-19 Highlanders are in a tie with UCSB in the Big West standings at 6-6. As a result, this weekend will be a test for both teams as they both will have an opportunity to separate themselves in a tightly packed Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>The three-game series begins Friday evening at 6 p.m. at the Riverside Sports Complex. Saturday night’s game will also be a night game at 6 p.m. followed by Sunday’s series finale set for a 1 p.m. afternoon start time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 25th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51027\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51027\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/","id":4671,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4670,4669,4668],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":15,"route":"/categories/sports/baseball","highestPage":21}},"__N_SSG":true}
