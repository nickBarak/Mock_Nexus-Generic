An error on the UCSB side in the top of the seventh inning allowed Westmont to score three runs and cut the lead to 8-4.</p>\n<p>“We made some missed cues throwing the ball around,” Loredo said. “We’ll work on that before the games this weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB travels north to Washington for a series against Washington State this weekend in another three-game matchup before Big West play begins in April. After last year’s mediocre finish, the Gauchos look forward to using a different mentality and newfound motivation in order to reach a postseason berth this summer.</p>\n<p><strong>THE CONFERENCE</strong></p>\n<p>“Our effort wasn’t good enough to compete in the Big West last year,” Brontsema said. “The change this year is that we’re going to be more competitive.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played through three separate losing streaks of five games in a row throughout the season last year, going 3-9 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium during conference play. In the interview, Brontsema seemed reluctant to bring up the past at all.</p>\n<p>“We lost some home series last year that were very disappointing,” he said. “Some of those losses outweighed the wins.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finished in fifth place — its lowest conference seed since they finished seventh in the Big West in 2007.</p>\n<p>This year, two teams from the conference have been voted into the top-30 in the nation, according to a national poll by USA Today. UCI is currently ranked #26, while defending Big West Champion Cal State Fullerton is ranked #9. Last season, Fullerton lost only three conference games, including one to UCSB, while second-place Irvine went 17-7. UC Riverside and Pacific finished in third and fourth place, respectively, with records of 13-11 and 12-12.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton is seen as the top team in the conference,” junior Ryan Palermo said. “It’s always a special weekend when we play them.”</p>\n<p>With such a competitive schedule, UCSB has practiced a more disciplined way of playing during practice and game situations.</p>\n<p>“The mentality is to keep the game simple and don’t look too far into the future,” Trevor Whyte said. “The coaching staff has preached the small things.”</p>\n<p>Even playing catch has become a significant factor in the baseball team’s preparation for league play.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about being in a routine, getting into a routine and sticking with it,” Whyte said. “Once you get into conference you already have your routine down.”</p>\n<p>Scouting reports on baseball teams do little to predict another squad’s strategy. UCSB will rely on past experiences with particular teams to understand particular players and patterns on offense and defense.</p>\n<p>“Scouting reports could be on or off,” Whyte said. “Most of it is based off what teams have tried to do in years past. We learn from that and make the adjustments.”</p>\n<p>Adjustments will be crucial to the team’s performance during Big West play, which will provide UCSB with ample competition throughout the coming months.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to playing all [Big West games],” senior pitcher Jesse Meaux said. “Every conference game is a fight to the death.”</p>\n<p><strong>THE SQUAD</strong></p>\n<p>Teams usually have team captains. This year, the UCSB baseball team does not.</p>\n<p>“Everyone needs to lead,” Brontsema said. “It’s not a situation where you got to follow the leader. It’s a situation where everyone needs to do the right things.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns a number of players from last year’s team. Seniors such as Mark Haddow will provide experience for newcomers to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Haddow is a guy that has taken the lead as much as anybody,” Brontsema said. “We’re asking everybody to be a leader, everybody to do things right.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has 16 seniors on its active roster, as well as 12 freshmen. Only nine players are either sophomores or juniors.</p>\n<p>“Freshmen have stepped up and done a great job,” Whyte said. “They are doing everything they can do to learn from the upperclassmen.”</p>\n<p>While the team’s starting lineup is anchored by older players, three freshmen — pitcher Cameron Cuneo, infielder Joe Woodward and catcher Joe Winterburn — highlight a strong class of first-year players. While Cuneo was the only freshman to see playing time against Westmont, Winterburn made his collegiate debut in the home opener against La Salle, and will continue to catch during the team’s upcoming series in Washington.</p>\n<p>“[Winterburn] is a very polished and poised guy,” Brontsema said. “There’s nothing that he’s shown us so far that tells us he doesn’t deserve more [playing] time.”</p>\n<p>UCSB lost arguably one of its best players to the MLB when Mario Hollands was drafted during the offseason. Seniors Loredo and Meaux will fill this year’s pitching rotation. Meaux, given All-Big West Conference honorable-mention accolades last year, was a late-round draft pick by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2010, but chose to return to UCSB and play his final season. Joining Loredo and Meaux on the mound will be senior Greg Davis, who finished second on the team for most strikeouts last year.</p>\n<p>“[We] have guys returning who are going to be better, and that should make us better,” Brontsema said. “Guys like that can help fill the void of losing a guy like Mario.”</p>\n<p>Haddow supports the team’s defense from right field, and will be a major contribution to UCSB’s offensive output as well. As a junior last season, Haddow was tied in leading the team with 17 stolen bases with an on-base percentage of .373.</p>\n<p>Whyte, who led the team in multiple offensive categories last season and hit five home runs with a .304 batting average, will start at first base. Sophomore Steven Moon fills the shortstop spot left vacant by Valaika. He made six starts during the 2010 season as a freshman.</p>\n<p>“We have depth — we have a lot of really good guys,” Meaux said.  “There’s a lot of seniors and a lot of experience, and the freshmen are a bunch of good ballplayers.”</p>\n<p><strong>A NEW BEGINNING</strong></p>\n<p>Last year’s battles within the Big West ended poorly for UCSB, as the team finished the season at 10-14, tied with rival Cal Poly for fifth place. This year’s squad plans on using the underachieving effort of 2010 as encouragement for its conference games as the season continues through spring.</p>\n<p>“We have a huge motivation to do what we failed to do last year,” Whyte said. “Last year we focused too much on the following series or who we were playing in months to come. It’s all about taking it one pitch at a time [this year].”</p>\n<p>Extra effort began during fall practices, where the team would routinely meet during the week for mandatory and optional conditioning sessions and workouts. The training regimen has continued through Winter Quarter, and UCSB hopes that the work ethic will prove its worth in game-situations.</p>\n<p>“We’re all in very good shape for the long run,” Palermo said. “We have a lot of guys that want to work extra hours at night or work out on a day off. It’s going to play a huge role during season.”</p>\n<p>The team hopes that its losing effort shown last year will fuel a mentality that many Gaucho players share.</p>\n<p>“Everybody’s real serious about their business,” Meaux said. “We’re all working toward the same goal, which is making it to regionals then making it to Omaha.”</p>\n<p>Omaha, Nebraska has been the annual home of the College World Series since 1950. Because the Big West is so strong — ranked by rivals.com as the sixth-best conference in the nation — UCSB does not necessarily have to win the league title in order to continue playing in the postseason. However, success in the team’s difficult preseason schedule will help the Gauchos reach its goal of a postseason berth.</p>\n<p>“Last year we focused too much on the following series, or who we were playing in the coming months instead of focusing on the current task,” Whyte said. “This year we’re focusing on the now.”</p>\n<p>“The now” will continue during the coming weeks, as UCSB faces several opponents before Big West play begins against Cal Poly on April 8. However, before league games begin, UCSB will continue to use its newfound work ethic and positive team unity to try and capitalize on a new season.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about staying as positive as you can,” Whyte said. “There’s nothing you can control. The past is the past.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/","id":4562,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4561,4560,4559],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The 11th Weekly Quote of the Week","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"\"It’s like buying a new car.

the guys have really worked hard and been committed.”</p>\n<p>La Salle University returns a majority of its players from a team that went 22-32 overall last season, and did not play past its own conference playoffs.</p>\n<p>“They were very young last year,” Brontsema said. “They returned a lot of players that were key contributors to their success … those teams are usually pretty dangerous.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns many of its own players from last year’s squad as well, including senior pitchers Kevin Gelinas and Jesse Meaux, both of whom were selected in last year’s MLB draft but chose to play their senior seasons as Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Haddow will be strong support for UCSB at the right field position, while the infield is led in part by senior first baseman Trevor Whyte. Whyte led the Gauchos in multiple offensive categories last season. He played in all 54 games, hitting five home runs and driving in 34 runs while batting .304 at the plate.</p>\n<p>“We’ve put a lot of effort in creating a better team,” Brontsema said. “I’m as anxious as anybody else to get out there and see what these guys can produce.”</p>\n<p>The series against La Salle will not be counted toward UCSB’s Big West Conference record. However, it will count toward the team’s RPI, which may be a determining factor for postseason play if the Gauchos are unable to win the league championship.</p>\n<p>“The better we can do out of conference, the stronger our RPI gets,” Brontsema said. “Our non-conference schedule is outstanding this year, and it starts with La Salle.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its three-day series against La Salle Friday at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

If we got that type of pitching all three days we would have had a chance at winning the series.”</p>\n<p>“Against Long Beach last Friday, Hollands allowed 10 runs on 15 hits and lasted only three innings. This Friday, he returned to the mound with a vengeance, allowing one run in a complete game, five-strikeout performance, improving his record to 4-3 and dropping his E.R.A. to 3.99. However, right-handed junior Jesse Meaux struggled on the mound on Sunday after pitching an eight-inning gem in his win against Long Beach last weekend, lasting only four  innings and allowing eight  runs and 12 hits.</p>\n<p>“Jesse’s great, [but] sometimes he gets into trouble when he tries to throw it hard,” Terhune said. “He’s very effective when he takes a deep breath and pounds the strike zone. When you leave the ball up, you get hurt — especially at our park.”</p>\n<p>Meaux added, “I wasn’t getting ahead on hitters. I fell behind, let that get in my head and gave them a lot of pitches they could hit. It would be easy to blame it on the umpires and stuff like that but I should do a better job of not letting [them] affect me.”</p>\n<p>Riverside scored a run in each of the first two innings of Sunday’s game. With two outs and two batters in scoring position, junior right-fielder Mark Haddow jumped the fence to snag a potential double for the third out, stranding both Highlander runners and preserving the 2-0 deficit for the Gauchos. He then hit a line drive single to center field to lead off the inning, but junior Trevor Whyte grounded into a double play to empty the base paths.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t capitalize on situations, get the key hits. It was frustrating,” Haddow said. “We still have an opportunity to do some things, but we’re going to need to play a little bit better.”</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the Gauchos will travel inland to play Cal State Bakersfield at 2 p.m., before hosting Cal State Northridge in a three-game series that begins at 2 p.m. on Friday. The team still has 16 more games before the end of the regular season.</p>\n<p>“We kind of lost momentum after that first game,” Hollands said. “Hopefully we’ll pick it up next week.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21614\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/friday-win-naught/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21614\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/friday-win-naught/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/friday-win-naught/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/friday-win-naught/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/friday-win-naught/","id":4553,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[4552,4551,4550],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Baseball Looks to Rock Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After its bullpen pitched eight shutout innings in a 5-4 comeback win against USC on Tuesday, the Gaucho baseball team looks to take three more in a conference series against UC Riverside, which begin...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After its bullpen pitched eight shutout innings in a 5-4 comeback win against USC on Tuesday, the Gaucho baseball team looks to take three more in a conference series against UC Riverside, which begins today at 3 p.m at UCSB’s Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p>“I feel good about this weekend,” centerfielder Gunnar Terhune said. “It’s nice to have [Riverside] play at our park, too.

[The win] says a lot about our bullpen.”</p>\n<p>With the win, the Gauchos jumped above .500 with an 18-17 overall record. The Gauchos have been streaky this season, putting together a five-game winning streak in March  before losing four in a row, winning three straight, then losing four in a row again. At their lowest point, the Gauchos lost five games in a row before winning the last game of the series against Long Beach State on April 25. The team has won its last two, but is 4-5 against conference opponents and occupies sixth place in Big West rankings.</p>\n<p>“It’s a little bit unique,” Head Coach Bob Brontsema said about the team’s inconsistency. “Anybody can beat you and you can beat anybody at any given time. The margin for error isn’t that great. We’re hoping for a win 12 lose 1 one situation, rather than a win four lose three.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Highlanders, who have won their last five games, are currently in fourth in the Big West with a 5-4 record after taking two of three against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“They’re a pretty solid team, all the way around,” said left-handed junior Mario Hollands. “They’ve been good the past couple of years, they’re solid pitching-wise and offensively. They’re a complete team.”</p>\n<p>In five meetings last season, the Gauchos took two games against the Highlanders. Still, UCSB has won 11 of its 19 games at home, and its previous success in Santa Barbara could be a factor for a pitching staff that has just begun to find its stride.</p>\n<p>“It’s because we spend so much time here,” Hollands said. “We know all the little hops and the intricacies of the field so well right now. It’s like a second home to us.”</p>\n<p>Hollands will start again on Friday night after a rare bad outing at Long Beach last weekend, in which he lasted only 3.1 innings and allowed ten runs on 15 hits. Prior to last week’s game, Hollands owned one of the lowest ERAs in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I know that Mario is going to come back with a vengeance,” Terhune said. “He’s coming out strong this weekend, I guarantee it.”</p>\n<p>Hollands added, “It can’t get worse than [my last game].

In the 2nd inning sophomore pitcher Matthew Brady took over for Davis and pitched two innings, allowing just one hit. Junior pitcher Sam Phippen then came in and pitched two scoreless innings with one strikeout. Junior pitcher Connor Whalen then pitched two scoreless innings for the Gauchos, before junior pitcher Nick Loredo finished out the final two innings and got his first career save.</p>\n<p>“They were able to take advantage of a first pitch strike and go from there,” Terhune said of the bullpen. “It speaks a lot for those guys. They bared down and threw strikes.”</p>\n<p>The lack of USC offense paved the way for a Gaucho comeback. In the bottom of the 3rd inning, junior second baseman Sean Williams singled and advanced to second before scoring on a single to center field from junior first baseman Trevor Whyte. Senior shortstop Matt Valaika also got on base and scored off another single, this time from the bat of senior left fielder Ryan Tregoning.</p>\n<p>Santa   Barbara continued to hit the ball well into the 4th inning. Junior designated hitter Beck Wheeler singled to right field and Terhune blasted a homer to left-center field to score two runs for the Gauchos and tie up the score.</p>\n<p>“I always swing hard in case I hit it, and, finally, I ran into one that ended up making it over the wall,” Terhune said.  “It was a big lift for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB took the lead for good off a Tregoning homerun in the 7th that barely stayed inside the left-field foul pole. With the Gauchos up by one, neither team got a hit the rest of the way, sealing the Trojans’ fate and securing a win for Santa   Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Ryan has been our go-to guy. He is a tough individual and as big of a team player as there is in the Big West, there’s no doubt about it,” Terhune said. “[The win] was a great uplift, especially for the morale of the team.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It would have been a huge momentum change, but Sean kept us with the lead.”</p>\n<p>In the top of the ninth, the Gauchos drove in three more runs off three hits and an error by the Dirtbag shortstop, giving Meaux some breathing room heading into the bottom of the ninth. After Meaux allowed a single and a double to start the bottom of the inning, senior right-hander David Meals pitched for the final three outs, earning his second save of the season.</p>\n<p>“[Sunday] we made the plays, and they didn’t,” senior centerfielder Gunnar Terhune said. “Jesse’s pitch count was so low, too. He threw first-pitch strikes and always got out the first batter.”</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s 8-4 loss, a Dirtbag fourth-inning line drive hit junior right-hander Nick Capito on the forehead, but Capito escaped with a scratch on his nose and was able to walk off the field on his own.</p>\n<p>“It was a low pitch, the guy got out in front of it, the ball goes 100 miles per hour plus off that bat,” Terhune said. “Thank god he was wearing his cap low. The ball caught his bill. Shit, the ball put his bill at a 90-degree angle.”</p>\n<p>According to Terhune, only two minutes later Capito was in the dugout, giving his teammates high fives. Before he was struck, Capito allowed two hits and one run in three innings, striking out four. Brontsema confirmed that the ball had indeed bent the bill of Capito’s hat in half.</p>\n<p>“His hat saved his life,” Brontsema said. “A guy laying face-down on the mound, it’s something you just don’t want to see out of your players, that’s for sure. Out of anybody, really.”</p>\n<p>Right-handed junior Nick Loredo replaced Capito, allowing three runs in 3.2 innings. In the eighth inning, Long Beach broke loose with four runs off right-handed junior Greg Davis, who had only allowed one run in his previous 16.1 innings.</p>\n<p>“Saturday, we didn’t get beat, we lost that game ourselves,” Terhune said. “We were in a situation where we could have easily won that game.”</p>\n<p>In Friday night’s 12-1 loss, Hollands lasted only 3.1 innings, allowing 10 runs and 15 hits in his shortest outing of the season. Before Friday, Hollands had a 3.12 ERA, which was good enough for fourth place in a conference filled with major league pitching prospects.</p>\n<p>“It was probably the worst game I’ve ever had in my pitching career,” Hollands said. “But it happens sometimes. I can’t worry too much about it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return home to face USC on Tuesday at 2 p.m. in a rematch of their 9-8 loss to the Trojans last week. They continue Big West play in a three-game weekend home series that begins on Friday at 2 p.m. UCSB has five more Big West series to play before the end of the regular season, which gives them plenty of opportunities to improve their conference ranking.</p>\n<p>“[Sunday’s] win still puts us in a pretty good position,” Hollands said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21044\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/gauchos-salvage-series-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21044\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/gauchos-salvage-series-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/gauchos-salvage-series-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/gauchos-salvage-series-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/gauchos-salvage-series-finale/","id":4555,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[4554,4553,4552],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":21,"route":"/categories/sports/baseball","highestPage":21}},"__N_SSG":true}
