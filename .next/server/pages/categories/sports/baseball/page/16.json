The team has also gone 2-1 since the last meeting between these two teams as UCSB took a conference series win against Long Beach State over the weekend. USD has been even better, going 3-0 since Tuesday and improving to 24-15 and 9-6 in the West Coast Conference, moving into a four-way tie for second place.</p>\n<p>In last Tuesday’s game, the Gauchos put up thee runs to take the lead in the top of the third on a couple of doubles. The Toreros responded in the bottom of the third for two, though, to chip away at the lead on a Bryant two-run home run.</p>\n<p>They then scored four more runs in the fourth to take a lead that they would not relinquish thanks to an additional home run by Bryant in the seventh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t throw the ball in the strike zone when Kris Bryant is up,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said about one of the keys to the game. “We’ve got to get the guys out in front of him and don’t pitch to him. We learned the hard way [last week].”</p>\n<p>USD’s Bryant currently sits at 20 home runs on the year, tops among all players in the NCAA. Last week, Bryant was named the national player of the week as he went 7-14 with a double, five home runs and six RBI. He is not a feast-or-famine hitter either, as he is hitting .353 on the year and has struck out only 27 times in 136 at bats.</p>\n<p>Bryant’s .897 slugging percentage, also best in the NCAA, is grounds for teams to pitch around as he has walked 49 times, 30 more than any other San Diego player. The walks, along with his average, have led to his .530 on-base percentage, which ranks second in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Bryant’s numbers could be even more impressive if it were not for the fact he hits atop the Torero lineup. Bryant’s high OBP has led him to score 51 runs on the year and his five stolen bases are second on his team.</p>\n<p>The Toreros scorched the Santa Barbara pitching staff for three home runs last week, since the weekday games typically feature relief pitchers throwing just a few innings as health has been an issue for the Gauchos’ staff this season.</p>\n<p>“We need to figure out who we are going to throw,” Checketts said. “We are a little short-manned with some guys banged up right now. It will probably be a staff day [today].”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense has started to heat up in recent games. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon went deep twice over the weekend and has driven in six runs over his last four games. Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who homered in the last game against USD, and freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic, who homered Sunday, have also shown some power for the Gauchos as they look to get some revenge from last Tuesday‘s loss.</p>\n<p>“Clutch hitting — it’s all we need,” Trinkwon said. “We throw strikes really well and our defense is good when we do throw strikes, so it’s just clutch hitting. We have to get guys on base and execute. Its all we really need to focus on.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is slated to take place at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of April 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50999\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50999\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/","id":4668,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4667,4666,4665],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Two of Three at Home Against Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2585.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2585.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  This weekend the UCSB baseball team played host to fellow Big West rivals Long Beach State and came away with a series win going 2-1.

Junior second baseman Jeff McNeil doubled to lead off the game and two productive outs brought him in to score the only Long Beach run of the day.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ half of the first inning, sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward walked and junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon hit a two-run home run into right field for the only two runs UCSB would score.</p>\n<p>From that point on, both pitchers were in total control. Long Beach junior starting pitcher Shane Carle pitched six and a third innings, allowing just the two runs on seven hits. The bullpen went on to pitch an inning and two thirds of hitless relief work while striking out four.</p>\n<p>Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone showed why he is the Gauchos’ ace. Pettibone allowed only one run in the first and cruised through eight and a third innings, striking out five in the process to improve to 5-2 on the year. Freshman reliever Dylan Hecht came in to get the last two outs, both strikeouts, to collect his fourth save on the year.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara came away with another one-run victory in walk-off fashion. The two teams exchanged the lead in the second, third and fourth innings until Long Beach put up a three spot in the sixth to take the lead on a three-run home run.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came back with one run in the eighth to tie it up late before a walk-off single by sophomore centerfielder Cameron Newell ended it in the bottom of the ninth to a score of 5-4.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, reigning Big West Pitcher of the Week in freshman Robby Nesovic took the mound for the Gauchos to try and complete the sweep. Nesovic was roughed up for seven runs, six earned, through just two and a third innings.</p>\n<p>“We thought we had [this] since Nesovic went out last week and was really good — he threw the ball well at Fullerton but he wasn’t able to repeat his performance,” Checketts said. “We will have to go back to the drawing board and figure out why and see what we need to change in his routine to get him more dialed in.

Baits pitched a solid six innings as he struck out six and allowed just three runs on nine hits. Baits pounded the strike zone in his first win of the year as he did not allow a walk.</p>\n<p>“We are going to start Baits again since he started last Tuesday against Pepperdine. He pitched well so we are going to give him another shot at it,” Checketts said. “He was good last week; hopefully he will go out and perform well again. It’s his hometown, I’m sure there will be a bunch of people to go out and see him, so hopefully he will be in character and just go out and throw the ball to the glove.”</p>\n<p>The Toreros have struggled as of late dropping four of their last five games, including three at home. Last weekend, USD dropped a three-game series to Pepperdine, the team Baits had pitched so well against last week.</p>\n<p>San Diego’s offense is led by junior third baseman Kris Bryant, who leads nearly every offensive power category in the WCC. Bryant has amassed 15 homers thus far this season. That is eight more home runs than anyone in the WCC or the Big West. His 36 RBI lead the WCC as does his .811 slugging percentage, over .230 points higher than the second place hitter. He also has a .515 on base percentage and 43 runs scored.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to keep Bryant’s bat quiet and put up some runs of their own. Santa Barbara was held to just seven runs over the weekend after they hit well against Cal Poly and Pepperdine last week. Sophomore centerfielder Cameron Newell had been on a tear but saw his 12-game hit streak end Sunday, while sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward continued his streak to eight games to spark the Gaucho attack.</p>\n<p>“Woody has really swung the bat well but nobody really hit well on Sunday,” Checketts said. “We need to get Trinkwon and Nesovic going a little bit behind them but Newell and Woodward have really done a good job of table setting for us.”</p>\n<p>First pitch for the UCSB-USD game takes place at 6 p.m. tonight at Fowler Park in San Diego.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8469.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1029292793\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50862\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50863\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/ucsb-finishes-road-trip-at-san-diego/baseball_markbrocher_02-23-2013_dsc_8469/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8469.jpg?fit=4800%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4800,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1361635506\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8469\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8469.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8469.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50863\" alt=\"Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8469\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8469-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 16, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.<br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In addition, they were able to hand Fullerton its first loss in league play. The Titans move to 31-5 overall and 8-1 in conference play, maintaining hold of first place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the Gauchos played a night game on the road, but did not seem to skip a beat from their previous few games as they again jumped ahead to an early lead 1-0 in the first inning. Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell extended his hitting streak right away with a single into right center. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon singled with one out to move Newell to third, who then proceeded to score on freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic’s groundout.</p>\n<p>Bats then went quiet in the game as both starting pitchers were on top of their games. Sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone pitched seven and two thirds innings and allowed just two runs on 11 hits while striking out three. On the other side for the Titans, freshman Thomas Eshelman topped Pettibone with eight innings of work, just one earned run and seven strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Neither starter factored in the decision as the game was decided on a blown save and a loss by the Gaucho bullpen, allowing two runs in the bottom of the ninth. The Gauchos put up two runs in the top of the ninth to take a 3-2 lead, but a leadoff bunt in the bottom of the ninth began the trouble for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The bullpen then crumbled as two walks by freshman closer Dylan Hecht loaded the bases. He was replaced by senior reliever Jared Wilson who came in and threw a wild pitch to allow one run before a sac fly ended the game 4-3.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Fullerton came out and roughed up any Gaucho pitcher to take the mound. Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome got through just three innings after he allowed six runs on eight hits.</p>\n<p>He was relieved by freshman Hector Lujan, who was also touched up for three runs in just an inning and a third. Freshman pitcher Domenic Mazza then came in to stop the offensive explosion and gave up just one run in his three and two thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Freshman Justin Garza of the Titans earned his seventh win of the season and is still without a loss on the year after his seven inning, nine strikeout performance.</p>\n<p>Game three was a flipped script after the previous day’s drubbing. Nesovic pitched six and two thirds innings of shutout ball. He allowed just four hits and struck out two but walked four en route to his first win of the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ two runs would prove to be enough, as the Titans could not muster any offense. Newell saw his hit streak come to an end on Sunday after 12 straight games while Woody Woodward pushed his up to eight games over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Up next for Santa Barbara will be a one-game trip to San Diego on Tuesday evening. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/","id":4481,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4480,4479,4478],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Make Statement","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8296.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8296.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team is headed into perhaps the biggest series of the year this weekend.

He currently holds a 1.09 ERA, a .158 opponent batting average and has thrown the most innings of any Big West pitcher.</p>\n<p>The Titans also know how to close out games as they lead the league in saves thanks to junior outfielder/pitcher Michael Lorenzen, who has closed out 12 games to go along with his seven home runs and 35 RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to continue the hot hitting they have displayed over the last week. Having shown they can score early and late in the game, the Gauchos are in no shortage of confidence heading into the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Being able to put up some runs early and late is a big deal,” Trinkwon said. “It lets us know that if we do put up some runs early and happen to lose a lead that it’s not over and we can come back. I’m sure it will be tough to hold [Fullerton] to very little runs, so it will be a good thing that we can score later.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell will ride a 10-game hitting streak into Fullerton. He has scored a run in eight games over the streak, and half of the games have been multi-hit contests for the Gauchos’ leadoff hitter. Sophomore Woody Woodward, the Gauchos’ No. 2 hitter, has a five-game hitting streak in which he has scored five runs and driven in three. Woodward just missed hitting for the cycle on April 6 when he had a four-hit game against Cal Poly, needing a home run to complete the feat.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Gauchos on Friday will be sophomore starter Austin Pettibone. Pettibone leads the team with 56.2 innings pitched as he has anchored the staff. He leads UCSB starters with a 2.86 ERA and is tied for the team lead with four wins.</p>\n<p>“It all starts on the mound and I have all the faith in the world in Austin Pettibone. He should go out and give us six or seven innings in his start and pound the strike zone and put pressure on them,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “I suspect guys throwing under the lights, where it’s a little harder to score, to have the run totals a little lower.”</p>\n<p>Despite both teams toting top notch pitching staffs, evident by both teams being top four in ERA, opponent average and total runs allowed, the top three run producers in the Big West will be facing off in this series. Numbers one and two come from Cal State Fullerton in Lorenzen and sophomore infielder J.D. Davis and number three is Santa Barbara’s sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>“The bats are great, but the arms are great too, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s 8-7 but I also wouldn’t be surprised if its 2-1,” Trinkwon said. “There are just so many good players playing in one weekend so it’s tough to tell.”</p>\n<p>The big weekend kicks off Friday at 7 p.m. followed by another night game Saturday at 6 p.m. The series will conclude Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m., at which point one team will come away as a major force in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 11th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/","id":4478,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4477,4476,4475],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Rematch Against Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MagaliGauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MagaliGauthier.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team picked up a big road victory yesterday afternoon against Pepperdine University, winning 5-4.

He got in a little trouble early, but started to cruise after that.”</p>\n<p>The Waves now fall to 18-13 on the season but maintain a 6-3 West Coast Conference record in the non-league game with UCSB. The Gauchos improve to 17-14 overall and 3-3 in the Big West, thanks to a stellar outing by freshman pitcher Connor Baits.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Baits threw six strong innings, allowing just three earned runs while striking out six to earn his first win of the year. The Waves starter, junior Matt Maurer, was the starter against the Gauchos last week as well, but the second time around did not go so well for the lefthander. Maurer allowed 10 hits and four runs through just four innings of work while recording just one strikeout and a walk.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara offense was able to get to Maurer early as it scored twice in the top of the first. Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell singled to lead off the game, stretching his hitting streak now to 10 games. He was followed up by a single by junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon to put two runners on with just one out. Freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic moved the runners over with a groundout and with two men in scoring position, sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa drove in both runners with a single through the left side.</p>\n<p>“Having big bats behind you gets you better pitches and gets you on base and having Nesovic and Kuresa hitting behind me is great,” Trinkwon said. “It helps a lot being able to score early; when you do your confidence is up for the rest of the game. You already got some runs out of the way, so it’s easier putting up more later.”</p>\n<p>Baits got into trouble only in the second and third innings. In the second, he allowed back-to-back doubles to lead off the inning and score a run followed by a two-out single to drive in the second. In the third inning, Baits started off well by striking out the first two hitters, but a base hit and hit batter set up an RBI single for sophomore catcher Kolten Yamaguchi, his second RBI of the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came back in the fifth when Trinkwon led off with a walk and Kuresa drove a 3-1 pitch into left field for two runs to put UCSB back in the lead. They would tack on an insurance run, which came in handy in the sixth when freshman third baseman Ryan Clark scored on a single by sophomore Woody Woodward and a Pepperdine error.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a trip to Cal State Fullerton for a three-game weekend series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50751\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/ucsb-wins-rematch-against-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50751\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/ucsb-wins-rematch-against-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/ucsb-wins-rematch-against-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/ucsb-wins-rematch-against-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/ucsb-wins-rematch-against-pepperdine/","id":4477,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4476,4475,4474],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look For Revenge at Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Today, the UCSB baseball team heads to Malibu to take on Pepperdine University in a rematch of last Tuesday’s showdown where the Waves escaped with a 3-1 victory.

Miller pitched 10 scoreless innings, struck out 10 and did not walk a single opposing batter. He, however, did not earn the win as the game was not decided until the 11th inning.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos, they remain in the middle of the back in the Big West conference. At 16-14 and 3-3 in the Big West, they remain tied in the standings with three other teams for fourth place.</p>\n<p>However, the last series showed promise for the Gauchos. Cal Poly is currently 4-2 in league play but the two losses came against the Gauchos, one defeat coming in a 13-2 drubbing on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>In the previous meeting last week, Pepperdine scored early and often, but after the fourth inning there was near silence as the pitchers for both sides got into ruts. The Waves scored on just the second at bat after a leadoff double by freshman second baseman Hutton Moyer set the table and later came in on an error.</p>\n<p>Leading off the second inning, the Waves’ junior left fielder Chris Amezquita homered to take a 2-0 lead. The Gauchos managed a run in the bottom of the third, but the Waves answered back in the top of the fourth before the Gaucho bullpen pitched five scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ bats will look to stay hot, coming off a strong offensive weekend. Santa Barbara outscored Cal Poly 23-11 over the course of three games.</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell, currently one of the hottest hitters in any lineup, has now hit safely in nine straight games dating back to March 24 at Cal Poly. Of the nine games, four were multi-hit showings and he has scored eight runs and driven in six over that span.</p>\n<p>Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward is working on his own modest four-game hitting streak dating back to the first game against Pepperdine. Over the course of the streak, he has hit .529 with a big 4-5 game on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Today’s game is set to take place at 3 p.m. at Eddy D.

Freshman starting pitcher Robby Nesovic got through just three and a third innings, allowing six runs. However, just two were earned as the Gauchos defense lacked its usual reliability.</p>\n<p>“I thought Robby Nesovic gave us a chance. He threw the ball in there well,” Checketts said. “He should have gone five and given up just a run or two.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, now 16-14 and 3-3 in the Big West, had collected just one hit through six innings, but finally broke through in the bottom of the seventh inning as they put up two runs in the seventh, eight and ninth as they attempted a major comeback.</p>\n<p>With the score 7-4, sophomore pitcher Reed Reilly prevented a base hit from getting through the middle. He kicked a grounder and recovered to make the play, saving a run and making an important out as the Gauchos were just one base hit away from tying the game. Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell struck out with the tying run on second to end the game.</p>\n<p>“We had a chance. We put pressure on them and they were backpedaling a little bit as we got our momentum going. I thought we were going to get a shot,” Checketts said. “It would have been nice to get a swing off on that last pitch, but there were some good at-bats by our guys to give us a chance.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos exploded for 13 runs as they went on to beat the Mustangs 13-2. Santa Barbara scored in the first inning, then went quiet until a huge 11-run sixth sealed the deal as the outburst brought 16 men to the plate.</p>\n<p>Nesovic went 4-4 on the day and drove in four runs as he led the team on the day, but sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward had nearly as impressive of a line as he went 4-5, scored three runs and drove in two, doubling and tripling in the process.</p>\n<p>Game one on Friday was a much closer game for the two teams. Cal Poly struck first in the top of the fourth inning on a home run by junior center fielder David Armendariz. The Gauchos came back in the bottom half of the fourth to tie it before taking the lead in the bottom of the sixth.</p>\n<p>UCSB tacked on some insurance runs in the seventh when Newell stole home on a double steal of third and home by Woodward and Newell respectively.

Trinkwon, sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa and sophomore left fielder Steven Fisher each homered in game two which was the biggest display of power the Gauchos have managed in a single game this year.</p>\n<p>However, game one was a much different story as the Gauchos were not only shut out, but ace pitcher sophomore Austin Pettibone was roughed up in the loss. It was the worst outing for Pettibone this year as he allowed six runs on 10 hits, two of them home runs.</p>\n<p>Opposite of Pettibone that day was senior pitcher Joey Wagman, who threw quite a gem for the Mustangs. Wagman allowed just two hits in seven innings while striking out 11 Gauchos en route to his fifth win of the year.</p>\n<p>Wagman is currently 6-1 with 59 strikeouts — tops in the Big West — in 46 innings and a .208 opponent batting average.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off of a sweep of UC Davis last weekend, a series in which the Mustangs senior second baseman Denver Chavez recorded seven hits in 15 at bats to boost his already impressive batting average to .390 and his 41 base hits lead the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will count on Pettibone to bounce back to form this weekend as he leads the Gauchos with a 2.92 earned run average through 48 and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Projected game two starter freshman Justin Jacome can make it two in a row against the Mustangs as he was the winning pitcher against Cal Poly a couple weeks ago when he allowed just three runs in six-and-a-third innings while striking out four.</p>\n<p>“[Our pitchers] can’t be scared. They need to come out and throw strikes and show off their stuff,” Trinkwon said. “We have great arms so if they are able to pound the zone and not be afraid, they should be fine.”</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green Rivalry continues this weekend with the first pitch set for Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium followed by a Saturday 2 p.m. game and the series finale will take place at 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of April 4rth, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/","id":4474,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4473,4472,4471],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Contest Against Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team fell to Pepperdine Tuesday afternoon with a score of 3-1.

The Waves are coming off a three game series at BYU where they dropped the first two games in Utah before taking the final game of the series 9-6. Pepperdine will be concluding its five game road trip today.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine sophomore catcher Kolten Yamaguchi went 3-5 in the final game of the series against BYU and drove in two runs. In fact, Yamaguchi has been on a tear as of late. He has played in just 13 of the Waves 26 games, but leads the team with a .396 batting average, is tied for the team lead with four home runs and leads the team with a .688 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa and junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon headline the gaucho offense. Both had solid weekends in Hawaii as each drove in three runs. Trinkwon broke out in a big way in the final game in Hawaii with two hits, including a homerun, two runs scored and three RBI.</p>\n<p>Kuresa has continued his dominance as the most dangerous hitter in the Gauchos lineup. He has his average up to .294 with team leading seven doubles, two triples and a homerun, while his 20 RBI rank sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We are facing a left hander and we have swung the bats pretty well against left handers, so that’s in our favor.” Checketts said. “The lineup is also getting easier to write out because we have so many injuries right now and don’t have a whole lot of options. We had a really good effort by Dalton Kelly on the last weekend so he will be out there again.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outfielder Kelly went 6-11 with two triples and six RBI while in Hawaii to make a name for himself in this Gaucho lineup and out performed most anyone on the road trip.</p>\n<p>Heading into Tuesday’s game the Gauchos will be starting their third freshman starting pitcher in the last three games as the long weekend has taken its toll on the staff.</p>\n<p>“We are going to have to staff the game [today].” Checketts said. “We are a little thin on the mound and we used a lot of guys so Hector Lujan will start for us. He will go probably just a couple innings then we will use everyone else for an inning or so.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is slated for 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of April 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/gauchos-set-to-face-pepperdine-at-home/","id":4664,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4663,4662,4661],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Series Against Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While the rest of campus was in the midst of winter finals, the UCSB baseball team went 4-3 over the break in two weekend series and a solo game against Notre Dame.

The Gauchos went on a three-game winning streak by defeating Notre Dame and taking two out of three in a series against Sacramento State. The streak ended with a loss to Cal Poly on the road but Santa Barbara bounced back in a home game against the Mustangs before dropping a game three back in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>The UCSB baseball team finished up their spring break weekend with a four-game series at the University of Hawaii this past weekend. The Gauchos were victorious in game one but fell in games two and three to bring their record to 13-12 and 1-2 in Big West conference play. The Warriors move to a record of 7-17 on the year and 2-1 in the Big West. The four game series began Thursday when the Gauchos captured the first game of the series and continued through Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were led by sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa in game one against the Warriors where his three hits and three RBI propelled Santa Barbara to victory. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone was touched up for four runs through five and two-thirds innings but left the game with the lead. Sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle relieved Pettibone to escape the sixth but allowed a run in the seventh after two singles and a wild pitch put a runner in scoring position to score on a groundout.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the top of the ninth inning the Gauchos sophomore right fielder Luke Swenson began a rally with a single to lead off the inning. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon then sacrificed Swenson to second base to put the go ahead run in scoring position with the heart of the order coming up. The Warriors picked their poison by intentionally walking the clean-up hitter in freshman designated hitter Robert Nesovic, who since March 9 is hitting .366. The walk brought up Kuresa who would then double in both runners on the first pitch to take a two-run lead in the top of the ninth and seal the victory in game one 7-6.</p>\n<p>Game two on Friday was dominated by the Warriors senior starting pitcher Corey MacDonald. The Gauchos jumped to an early two-run lead in the top of the second but MacDonald would only allow just two more hits the rest of the game and go on to pitch a complete game, striking out six for his third win of the year.</p>\n<p>Gauchos starting pitcher freshman Justin Jacome had matched MacDonald through six innings of work but could not get out of the seventh inning as he and the Santa Barbara relievers relinquished four runs and the lead, falling 6-2 on the day.</p>\n<p>On Saturday the Gauchos fell again in Hawaii 6-4. Santa Barbara again scored first on a RBI double by Nesovic but freshman starting pitcher Kenny Chapman allowed a run in each inning from the second to the fifth. Chapman was kept from the decision thanks to a three-run home run by sophomore third baseman Peter Maris in the top of the fourth.</p>\n<p>With the game tied into the bottom of the eighth inning, Mahle, who had relieved Chapman in the fifth, walked the leadoff hitter and allowed a single before a double into right field by junior right fielder Connor George gave the Warriors the lead for the final time.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos will be a one game showdown at home against Pepperdine on Tuesday, April 2 at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/","id":4667,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4666,4665,4664],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Longhorns in Texas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team has embarked on its second road trip of the season this weekend traveling to Austin to play a three-game series with the University of Texas.

The Gauchos head into the series after a successful weekend as they are winners of four straight. Texas welcomes Santa Barbara having just snapped a four game losing streak with a decisive 6-1 victory against Texas Pan-American.</p>\n<p>“The key [to the weekend] is just to get our young guys to go play the game of baseball and not play Texas,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We need to have the attitude of Texas is playing us and we are playing the game of baseball and that is really the message to our guys. The pitching mound is still going to be 60 feet, six inches and first base is still 90 feet away.”</p>\n<p>Texas at 7-5 so far this season got off to a great start. The Longhorns began the year at 6-1 and swept Nebraska at home before hitting the losing streak against the likes of Sam Houston State and Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Longhorns are led by preseason All-American junior pitcher Corey Knebel. Knebel was named to the second team as well as the Stopper of the Year watch list and Golden Spikes watch list. So far this year, the closer has recorded three saves in 11.1 innings pitched and is just 11 saves away from passing Houston Street as the schools all-time saves leader. Knebel headlines a bullpen that has kept the Longhorns a perfect 7-0 when leading through six innings.</p>\n<p>The 8-4 Gauchos, currently in fourth place in the Big West, look to take advantage of the strong Texas pitching by continuing their hot hitting. Over the four game winning streak, the Gauchos have outscored their opponents 24-7, and in the last four games have twice won in their last at bat. The success of the offense stems from the ability to get the lead-off runner on board.</p>\n<p>“We like to get guys moving and run. We sacrifice bunted a lot last year and haven’t as much this year,” Checketts said. “Our first order of priority is to steal and if you can’t run on the pitcher or catcher the second option is to hit and run. If the guys got really good stuff we will go to sac bunting because we like to keep guys moving and put pressure on people.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is hitting a solid .280 on the year. Sophomore utility man Woody Woodward leads the team with a .438 average and a stellar .561 on base percentage. Woodward and sophomore centerfielder and leadoff hitter Cameron Newell lead the team with 10 and 11 runs scored, respectively, and are driven in regularly by the heart of the order thanks to consistent hitting from junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>“I imagine if we think the pitcher is going to be on his game and that it will be tough to put up a couple runs we will be bunting and stealing more than usual,” Trinkwon said. “But if he is off his game you may see us swing away.”</p>\n<p>The weekend matchups and projected starters are sophomore Austin Pettibone at 5p.m. on Friday, freshman Justin Jacome at noon Saturday and sophomore Andrew Vasquez at 10 a.m. on Sunday at the University of Texas’ Disch-Falk Field.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/","id":4660,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4659,4658,4657],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Fourth Straight in Rout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/UCSB-Baseball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/UCSB-Baseball.jpg?resize=520%2C347&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team capped its long nine-game homestand on Monday with a blowout win over Saint Mary’s College by a score of 10-1.

Chapman had walked the leadoff hitter who then stole second to move into scoring position. Ferguson sent a 0-2 pitch into right field to put his team on the board first.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tied the game in the bottom of the second inning after getting their own leadoff hitter aboard. Sophomore right fielder Luke Swenson singled to shortstop and advanced to second base on a wild pitch. Freshman center fielder Andrew Calica then doubled in Swenson to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Kelsey Outram had gotten through four innings relatively unscathed for the Gaels but was hurt by allowing the leadoff man aboard. In the bottom of the fifth inning, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon singled to start the inning followed by sophomore Tyler Kuresa.

Swenson would come around to score on a squeeze by freshman second baseman Ryan Clark for the three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put another three-spot on Saint Mary’s when yet again the leadoff batter reached base. With the bases loaded and one out, Kuresa crushed a double to right center field to clear the bases and put the Gauchos up 7-1.</p>\n<p>“It was a great day today. Everyone was on,” Trinkwon said. “We got 12 hits, probably should have had even more; I know I let a couple opportunities slip away, I know some other guys did too but we are satisfied with the win.”</p>\n<p>Chapman led the top of the seventh off with a walk and was pulled in favor of freshman Domenic Mazza, who recorded three quick outs to keep the Gaels off the board in the seventh. Fellow relievers, freshman Connor Baits and senior Jared Wilson, followed suit with quick eighth and ninth innings to seal the victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a good bounce back for [Chapman and Mazza].
