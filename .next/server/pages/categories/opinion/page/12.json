It is a time when sentiment and emotion fill the air. Whether you’re a Scrooge who thinks the holiday season is just one big marketing scheme or a Christmas fanatic who puts their tree up in October, I think it’s safe to say this time of year causes a lot of us to reminisce and reflect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, being single during a time of so much love and connection can lead to feelings of loneliness or fear. It’s pretty much impossible to escape the constant romance and adoration filling every street corner, movie and song. On top of that, it’s cuddle weather 24/7. Getting through December can be rough for many, but nothing comes close to the stress of facing the dreaded New Year’s Kiss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not sure who came up with idea of a New Year’s Kiss, but it’s never been one of my favorite holiday traditions. Don’t get me wrong; I think the concept of it is great. It’s meant to be nothing more than a positive and light-hearted way to kick off a fresh start. In fact, New Year’s Eve is probably my favorite night of the entire year. I just hate the pressure that comes with wondering if you’ll be getting that kiss at midnight. Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For some people, that’s part of the fun; not knowing with whom or how you’re going to jump into the next 365 days. I’ve definitely had years in which I went into the night with that mentality and I came out the next day feeling like my year started off on a pretty good note.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the clock ticks closer to 12, it can be pretty comical to watch others search the room aimlessly for a potential comrade. If you haven’t locked one down by 11:50 p.m., you might be in some trouble. As the bar begins to shout “10, 9, 8, 7…” humans of all kinds come together to share that special and sometimes awkward midnight moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner. Considering the fact that I’ve never been in a relationship on New Year’s Eve, these have always been my go-to tactics, and they seem to have worked out decently. Plus, any time I felt that twinge of disappointment, I would tell myself: There’s always next year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year, I feel a little differently about getting that kiss at midnight. This year, I don’t really have any desire to enter into 2017 with some meaningless, drunk kiss. As cliché as it sounds, the New Year can truly mean a new chapter. For some of us, it can be the motivation we need to make real and difficult changes in our lives. It can be what inspires us to work toward being the best versions of ourselves. Maybe some years, you’re really meant to celebrate your fresh start with just you, and not a stranger in a bar.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While strangers in bars can be fun, they can’t come close to giving you the joy you can give yourself. They also can’t replace the void that’s been left by the person you wish you were kissing at midnight. If you’re one of those people who aren’t just dealing with being single on New Year’s, but also with being heartbroken, it can be a double dose of hurt. It’s pretty much impossible not to wonder who they’ll be kissing when the clock strikes 12, and you know you’ll be wishing it were you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, circumstance and timing just don’t allow for miracles to happen, even during the holidays. While this reality can be frustrating and difficult to face, it doesn’t mean you should settle. If you know in your heart how you feel, and who you feel it for, not one person in that bar is going to fill that void. Not one person in that bar is going live up to your expectations. Not one person in that bar is going to give you the kiss you actually want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, some years we actually do get that movie-moment kiss and fantasize about what the next 365 days may hold. Other years we end the night by tucking ourselves in bed, reminiscing on the 365 days that just passed. This year, I know that no matter what 2017 may bring, I have myself to face it with. Being secure and confident in yourself is one of the most difficult yet important lessons we are forced to learn as humans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving love and acceptance toward ourselves means we know who we are and what we stand for, regardless of mistakes or faults we may posses. It means you don’t need anyone other than yourself to feel validated and valued.  </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not getting that kiss at midnight doesn’t matter because you started your year off with someone who can never be replaced: you. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74641\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74641\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/","id":6284,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6283,6282,6281],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dear Regent Sherman, Whose Side are You On?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-12-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Casey Mix questions the UC's commitment to divesting from fossil fuels and sets an ultimatum for Regent Sherman.

Of the 90 billion dollars, 10 percent (9 billion dollars) is invested in “energy companies.” To be fair, “energy companies” can mean a lot of different things: renewable energy, alternative energy or 5-hour ENERGY. That being said, it is estimated that of the said 9 billion dollars, roughly 3 billion is invested in big oil and gas companies, a rough estimate, of course, because the UC’s office has refused to disclose the exact amount. Feel free to confirm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to note that in September 2015, after two years of pressure from UC students, the UC sold off roughly 200 million dollars worth of coal and tar sands investments, a remarkable achievement. And though I don’t want to take away from the significance of said divestiture, I’d argue it’s becoming a monotonous statistic, appearing in every UC school paper’s article about divestment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re clinging onto it. We can no longer beat our chests, and the 200 million dollars can no longer be a “look what we did!” boast. If we want to talk numbers, it was 7 percent of the estimated 3 billion dollars. We still invest 2.8 billion dollars in fossil fuels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would also like to quickly note that following the 200-million-dollar divestment, the UC’s Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bacher was quoted saying, “</span><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">institutions that ignore societal values in their investment strategy imperil their bottom line </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">today and for years to come.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is time for us all to admit that investments in oil and gas companies fundamentally ignore our societal values. If you haven’t yet, I encourage you to read the article. Here’s the link: </span><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The irony is remarkable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re a school system that takes great pride in our efforts to be green, efficient leaders in sustainability and renewable energy, from what we study in the classroom to the classroom itself. We also take immense pride in our diversity. We take pride in embracing all races, sexes, religions and ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We are taught to abhor discrimination, eliminate pollution and help build a brighter future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet the university I received an email from on Nov. 9 attempting to comfort me and remind me of my on-campus safe space locations, to reassure me the UC cherishes its diversity and in no way condones racism, sexism, misogyny, etc. voluntarily supports an industry that actively discriminates against, takes advantage of, pollutes and destroys marginalized communities within our state, across our country and around the world. Investments in fossil fuels stand against everything the UC stands for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m a fourth-year environmental studies student here at UCSB. I am and will forever be grateful to my parents and this university for the opportunities they have given me — to study, learn and grow as a person here. I take pride in my university, my home for the last four years. I take pride in my major, my involvement in Fossil Free UCSB and the knowledge I have gained from the amazing courses and thought-provoking, incredible professors here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want future generations of students to encounter what I have been so fortunate to experience. Regrettably, I would argue that because of our unsustainable investments in fossil fuels, this experience is in jeopardy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It simply puzzles me that all of this pride and leadership finds itself invested in industries we as a university educate and stand against. Nearly 700 UC faculty members have signed a petition stating investments in fossil fuels are no longer acceptable. Three UC faculty senates and six associated student senates, representing hundreds of faculty and tens of thousands of students, have called upon the UC to divest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just last week UCSB’s own student senate has reaffirmed its commitment to fossil fuel divestment. I know it will not be easy, and I know it cannot happen overnight, but we must begin the process of full divestment from fossil fuels. If we want to take pride in something — if we want to be leaders in something — let it be that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Sherman, Fossil Free UCSB has presented you with a choice. You can stand with students, our future and all the values of this great university and divest from fossil fuels. Or you can stand with oil and gas companies, who threaten not only my future and future generations but also communities up and down the state of California today. What you can’t do is both. So I will ask again: Whose side are you on?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope you will not only stand with us, but act. We must not do what is easy, but what is right. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ball is in your court, Regent Sherman. All of us are watching.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74592\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-14/dear-regent-sherman-whose-side-are-you-on/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74592\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-14/dear-regent-sherman-whose-side-are-you-on/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-14/dear-regent-sherman-whose-side-are-you-on/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-14/dear-regent-sherman-whose-side-are-you-on/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-14/dear-regent-sherman-whose-side-are-you-on/","id":6231,"author":{"id":651,"name":"Casey Mix"},"related":[6230,6229,6228],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: UCSB, Let’s Go Veg","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's Health Environment and Animal Rights Club explains why you should move to a plant-based diet. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the sake of the environment, animal welfare and nutrition, UCSB students should reduce their meat consumption, and the university should foster a trend toward plant-based diets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The environmental impact of animal agriculture is astounding. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concludes that 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions result from animal agriculture. By comparison, the EPA attributes 14 percent of emissions to all global transportation systems combined. Our diets clearly have a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">huge </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impact on the planet. In a seminal life-cycle impact assessment, Reijnders and Soret estimated the environmental impact of non-vegetarian meals to be between 1.5 and 2 times worse than vegetarian meals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the urgency of climate change, reducing meat consumption matters even more. The FAO reports that because of belches and manure, livestock accounts for 25 percent of anthropogenic methane emissions. Methane’s half-life in the atmosphere is eight years, compared to 100 years for carbon dioxide, so methane reduction offers a quicker route to curb global warming in the short-term. That is why the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that methane’s Global Warming Potential is 86 times greater than carbon dioxide’s.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing meat consumption also offers nutritional benefits. Though both plant-based and omnivorous diets are only healthy with deliberate effort, it is uncontroversial that most people eat too much meat. According to Johns Hopkins University, the average American eats 50 percent more meat than is needed for protein. (Arguably, any amount of meat is more than needed for protein; legumes and tofu offer comparable protein per calorie.) Yet, meat contains saturated fats that increase risk for heart disease and stroke. The World Health Organization reports that processed meats like bacon and sausage certainly cause cancer and that red meat probably causes cancer, too. Eating more plant-based meals could mitigate this unnecessary risk for heart disease, stroke and cancer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last, we want to discuss animal welfare without going into the graphic details that most readers probably already know. Instead, we’ll say this: To minimize costs and maximize profits, animals are treated like inanimate objects, not living creatures who can suffer. This industry affects the lives of nine billion animals – each the center of a distinct life – every year in the U.S. alone. Any reduction in this unnecessary suffering matters immensely to these animals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all, plant-based diets improve our health, our environment and the welfare of animals. While it is unrealistic to ask people to go veg overnight, a reasonable compromise exists, too: Students can try going meatless on Mondays. Doing so helps you build a repertoire of veg-options that you can rely on later if you do eventually decide to help the environment, the animals and your health by going veg all week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our university has a role to play here as well. In the course of our lives, college offers the best time to experiment with different lifestyles, belief systems and interests since habits – especially dietary habits – tend to become cemented during adulthood. As a result, the university has a unique opportunity and consequently a unique responsibility to assist students trying to reduce their meat consumption.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen and Dining Services have already made commendable progress toward that end. The convenience stores, for example, introduced new vegan options this quarter, and Dining Services goes above and beyond in serving sustainable food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many plant-based Gauchos find that it is easier to eat at home than on campus. To make a plant-based diet easier, convenience stores on campus could carry more than a single vegan green salad; there are eight non-vegan ones. Dining commons could introduce vegan desserts, as UC Davis and UC Berkeley have done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larger projects are also worth considering. UCSB’s Climate Action Report could include food-related emissions under scope-three emissions so we can more effectively monitor our food’s environmental impact. As contracts for red and processed meat expire, Dining Services could commit to replacing at least portions of those ingredients with plant-based ingredients. Such moves, of course, require time and resources to implement; trade-offs always have to be made.

We all tried those “serious” relationships in high school, but most of us left them behind when we moved away for university, because what’s the point in trying to make long distance work when you haven’t even figured out who you are yet? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dating is a commitment, and one that most of us put off until we’ve decided what we want in life. It’s not something we pursue in a college setting. If it happens, it happens, but we don’t go looking for it. And it’s not something that’s valued in our college culture, especially if it’s an old high school relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But maybe it should be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of the romantic and sexual culture at UCSB, I’ve found myself in the minority. I started dating my boyfriend my sophomore year of high school. He got my dad’s permission, bought some flowers and asked me to be his girlfriend during halftime at a school football game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seems pretty typical, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as cheesy as it sounds, we aren’t the stereotypical “dated in high school and never experienced anything else” kind of couple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he was a senior and I was a sophomore when we got together (I was pretty much the coolest sophomore on the block), he graduated and left me in the world of high school for two years. We got used to not seeing each other every single day or being in the same world 24/7. We learned to enjoy living lives apart from each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So once I packed my bags and moved to Santa Barbara, it wasn’t a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">complete</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shock to us. Sure, it wasn’t easy. We had to make some adjustments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But my biggest struggle wasn’t being away from him. It was being one of the only people in my social circle in a relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the hookup culture we live in, it’s hard to take a long-distance, long-term relationship seriously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among my fellow lonely girlfriends, I’ve heard a slew of struggles:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many hot guys everywhere.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m so fucking horny.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just want cuddles.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When everything around you seems to be a raging sex fest, it’s not easy to wait for that special someone. It takes a certain kind of determination, and it shouldn’t be taken lightly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had lots of talks with my single friends about their opinions on long-distance relationships. Everyone seems to say something along the same lines:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I mean, since you guys have been together for three years, it makes sense. But for most people, I think long-distance seems like a waste of time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand that viewpoint, and it’s not wrong. To drag out a relationship just to feel comfortable and loved is definitely an unnecessary and selfish use of time and energy. College </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a time of experimentation and self-discovery. If you can’t seriously imagine yourself hand in hand with a guy with a ring on your finger, you shouldn’t waste your time on him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I thrive in my relationship. He pushes me to try new things. He helps me to grow and change for the better. We share new experiences, we question things and we help each other through whatever bullshit life can throw at us. We have conflicts, but we don’t have fights. We call each other out when it needs to be done. Most relationships – especially those established in high school – aren’t like that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this isn’t a rant about how perfect my romantic life is. It’s a critique of the way our community deals with serious relationships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You hear a lot of support here toward racial minorities, the LGBTQ community, women and other historically discriminated populations, and that’s amazing, but this is a kind of isolation that I never expected to experience in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, somebody told me that my boyfriend and I are cute together. A few months ago, I would have brushed it off. I know we’re cute. Today, it was one of the most meaningful things I could have heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have told me long-distance relationships never actually last.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I ever want to go out with my girl friends, I’m afraid I’ll be the only one who doesn’t want to dance on guys or hook up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very few people – even my closest friends – have expressed any kind of support for my relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a problem that nobody talks about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s nothing wrong with focusing on yourself in college. It’s great to expand your horizons, experiment and take some time for self-discovery. But that doesn’t mean that it’s wrong to be in a serious relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It feels good to be taken seriously. It feels good to still be seen as independent and fun and exciting.

These are stubborn facts recorded in articles and video footage.

After all, no group containing millions of Americans can be fairly painted with broad brushstrokes. Yet you seem so unhesitatingly willing to do the same for those who opposed Mr. Trump’s candidacy by labeling the large proportion of Americans who opposed Trump as merely “the left,” as if they were a monolithic political force devoid of the differing beliefs individuals can still have with their ideological peers. </span></p>\n<p>If we really are to unite together and put patriotism above partisanship, we ought to start by dispensing with the caricatures that have permeated our discourse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a conservative, the author’s embrace of Trump’s candidacy on the basis of conservatism puzzles me. I believe that America is safest when we embrace a policy of what Reagan called “peace through strength,” by establishing a strong and rigorous defense and standing resolutely with our allies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump believes that our partners in NATO are disposable, and that our support should be contingent upon how much they’ve paid us, as if we ought to play the role of the mafia demanding protection money. If Mr. Trump truly believed in “peace through strength,” he should know that NATO has helped </span><a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/nato/nato-can-remain-relevant/p28292\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preserve stability</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Europe for over half a century, and that our alliances are instrumental to our security, especially in this increasingly interconnected world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conservatism stems from the belief that the free market is the greatest economic engine in history, and when reasonably regulated, can create a rising tide that lifts all boats. Free trade facilitated Europe’s miraculous economic recovery after World War II and America’s stratospheric rise to the status of a global superpower. It has enabled those with lower incomes to have higher spending power by giving them access to cheaper products, and capitalism continues to be the economic force that lifts millions out of poverty in Africa and Asia.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Donald Trump represents the type of individual our Founders feared: a demagogue who appeals to our society’s worst impulses.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>This is not to say that freer trade has not come without its costs. Millions of American workers have lost manufacturing jobs because of foreign competition, and we should rightfully find ways to help them. But Donald Trump’s policies will not do that.

The office carries a great burden of responsibility, one that I do not believe Donald Trump is fit to carry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m ashamed of the decision our country has made on who should be president for the next four years.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facing potential tuition hikes, the Office of the External Vice President writes this letter to the student body of UCSB. This is the first of many in a series of letters outlining our plan on how to combat future tuition hikes.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Organic Act of 1868 promised that “tuition shall be free to all residents of [California]” permitting that the university had enough income for free education for all students. While for many years this pledge held true, the Board of Regents started skirting around this responsibility in 1921 by charging various fees, like an incidental fee and a registration fee. The Board continued avoiding the t-word even when in 1970 they enacted a high “educational fee” for all undergraduate and graduate students — a tuition increase in all but the name. This marked the beginning of a long rise in incremental charges to California residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From then on, things started taking a turn for the worse. Between 1975 and 1985, the annual cost of tuition and fees went from $630 to $1,296 for resident undergraduates, a 105 percent increase. In 1995, resident undergrads had to pay $4,354 annually, a number that climbed to $7,434 in 2005. This reached a flashpoint in 2009 when students occupied UC buildings in protest of a massive proposed 32 percent increase in tuition. The UC system began facing budget cuts, and in 2011 students paid more into the system in tuition than the state did in funding it. Today, resident undergraduates pay $12,294 annually in tuition and fees. Thanks to a strong mobilization effort from the student bodies across the UCs and the passing of Proposition 30, a tax on high earners to fund higher education, a two-year tuition freeze was agreed to in 2015. This tuition freeze expires at the end of this year.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I must preface this by saying that cutting funding for education is not done out of necessity, but out of political choice. Despite the renewal of Proposition 30 (Proposition 55 on the ballot), we might still be facing a tuition increase. If one is on the table, the hike would be slated for January. This means we must organize immediately to prevent another tuition hike from going through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doctrine of “high fee high aid” (HFHA) has dominated the Board of Regents’ approach to tuition for the past decade. In a nutshell, HFHA means exactly what its name implies: charge high fees to students and offer high financial aid. Not only is HFHA dangerous, but it is also unsustainable. High tuition has real ramifications on how students decide where to go to college and what they choose to study. A UK study conducted by the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON) found that students from low-income backgrounds are 20 percent more likely to attend a university near home and live at home while studying than their peers. Additionally, if fees were reduced, the participants said they were 45 percent more likely to choose a different major and 60 percent would work less during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary reasons why the UC system has had to increase tuition are difficult to pin down. While they can be attributed to decreased state funding and higher enrollment rates, the root of problem is much deeper than that. The General Fund has faced increasing demands in recent years and other necessary expenditures, like K-12 education and prisons, which have eaten a large portion of the budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these difficulties, the Office of the External Vice President remains committed to implementing new and innovative ways to prevent future tuition hikes. There are many solutions available, but one thing remains clear: We need wide sweeping changes to the way the University of California and California approach funding higher education.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74246\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74246\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/","id":5734,"author":{"id":390,"name":"Maya Halthore"},"related":[5733,5732,5731],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"First Night or Take a Hike?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/THAHUMP.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/THAHUMP.jpg?resize=487%2C599&ssl=1","description":"Whether it's a one night stand or a fairytale college romance, Allie Lebos wants you to put respect above all.

While there are still stigmas and judgments surrounding it, casually sleeping with someone right after meeting them is viewed by many as nothing more than harmless fun. For the most part, our generation has chosen to embrace and celebrate our sexuality rather than feel ashamed of it. However, some people still choose to maintain old-fashioned and modest views when it comes to sex.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a both guy- and girlfriends who believe that sex is great but simply aren’t willing to give it up on the first night. For them, sex contains many more strings than not, and comfortability is a huge factor. In reality, sex does require a certain level of security and comfort, and some people just naturally possess more of that than others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while it may not seem like a big deal for many of us, casual sex can definitely have some not-so-casual consequences. From STIs to unwanted pregnancies, there is definitely an element of risk when it comes to sex. Considering these very real possibilities, it makes a lot of sense as to why some people hesitate before jumping into bed with someone who is practically a stranger. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, the way I feel about sex on the first night can be summed up with: to each their own. Some people are comfortable enough to partake in the thrill every weekend, some are a bit choosier and others refuse to take the bait. In my opinion, as long as you’re responsible and standing by your convictions, there’s no wrong answer.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, I think a lot of people, especially girls, feel a certain amount of pressure to conform to the hookup culture that we have here in I.V. Everyone here is surrounded by incredibly attractive and charming people. Everyone here is surrounded by options. Everyone here is surrounded by competition. Because of this, I think a lot of girls feel the need to give into a game that they really don’t want to play. And the truth is, no one should be making decisions about their body or sexuality based off of the fear that they will be tossed aside for someone else.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until recently I hadn’t realized how often this happens. It’s hard for me to believe that anyone could so blatantly disregard someone that they’ve just met, simply because they find out that they won’t be getting into their pants just hours after learning each other’s names. The fact that people even have the audacity to do such a thing is pretty shocking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know girls who have spent whole evening with guys, where they danced, kissed and had a great time, only to be completely dropped the second that they let it be known that sex wasn’t an option. I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door. She didn’t even give a complete rejection; she simply specified that she wouldn’t do it IN THE DAMN BATHROOM. At first, I thought it was an ego problem. I assumed that these guys were just arrogant, misguided, spoiled idiots with some sort of disturbing god complex. In reality, I think it’s actually the exact opposite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a girl tells you that she’s not comfortable having sex the first night you’ve met, and you choose to respond in such a disgusting and disrespectful way, all that shows is how insecure you really are. It doesn’t make you look cool, desired or confident; it makes you look like a coward. Running at the slightest sign of rejection or effort literally shows how little self-esteem you must possess, and it’s somewhat laughable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are hundreds of girls in this town who will gladly sleep with guys on the first night, and if that’s what you’re looking for, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, reacting in such an immature and embarrassingly chauvinistic way is not an appropriate response when you run into someone who happens to have different intentions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has differing views and opinions when it comes to sex. However, one thing that everyone should agree upon is that no matter how you choose to go about it, respect is always involved, no matter what the circumstances. On top of that, I guarantee that making a girl (or guy in some cases) feel comfortable and respected will get you a whole lot farther in the bedroom than spinelessly attempting to manipulate or pressure your way into someone’s pants. Sex is supposed to be sexy, and coercion is not sexy. So if that’s your go-to tactic for maintaining your sex life, chance is you aren’t either.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to have your sex with a healthy helping of respect. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/","id":6362,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6361,6360,6359],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Special District Deception","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Dean Stewart shares why he believes Isla Vistans should vote against the Community Service District.

Restrictions will be used to limit student mobility and visitor access.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>\t  Local media has been covering this subject for over a year, and by my count I have read five or six versions of how this effort came about.  From former students and retired professors, the UCSB Foundation and Trustees, the idea came from everywhere and anywhere, every story sliced very finely, scrubbed clean and intended to prove the impartiality of university administration. The idea was forced upon them; they had to be compelled to become the major organizing factor behind the special district and commit over a million dollars to its solvency. </p>\n<p>\tAn obvious fact about the drive for the Community Service District is that it is not a student movement. I remember the Isla Vista of the early 1970s when the original drive for Isla Vista cityhood took place. There was a highly politicized student population; scores of young people took part in canvassing and circulating petitions. Students crowded and overflowed the Board of Supervisors meeting room on many occasions. The project, however, ran into the same stone wall more than once: the denial of financial viability for the Local Agency Formation Commission.</p>\n<p>\tIf the original idea for Isla Vista self-governance came from the student politics of the 1960s, it would be a mistake to assume it was a cause embraced by all progressives. The simplest and most lasting criticism of Isla Vista semi-independence is that it will not work for the students. The situation favors the stable, lasting forces. The students pass through, while UCSB administration is always there. The students will always be playing catch-up, always at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>\tUCSB administration would not advocate and support the creation of the Community Service District if they did not think they could control it. What they once opposed as a student movement, they now advocate. They recruited assemblymember Das Williams to write legislation to push aside the Local Agency Formation Commission. The political machinery put to work with Williams’s help is the most remarkable I have seen in over 40 years of Santa Barbara politics. It is a steam roller of paid staff and political hierarchy that all comes from outside Isla Vista. It is fraud calling for democracy. It is a powerful institution with a politician in its pocket.</p>\n<p>\tParking restrictions are the most often-stated goal of the special district. The whole intention is to constrain, confine and sequester Isla Vista to prohibit its free and easy access. A cumbersome, expensive system of stickers and tickets and 24 hour supervision would be created. Students who expect their friends to be able to visit would be faced with numerous obstacles.</p>\n<p>\tWhen students go to vote on Nov. 8, they will find a convenient slate of candidates, all approved by the UCSB-Das Williams machine. At this point, if anyone in Isla Vista feels like they are getting something shoved down their throat, they are. The cynicism of dominance pretending to be democracy is grotesque. This is not I.V. liberation. It is I.V. lockdown. </p>\n<p><em>Dean Stewart is a local writer and historian. </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/","id":5733,"author":{"id":388,"name":"Dean Stewart"},"related":[5732,5731,5730],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Why a Vote for Bruce Porter is a Vote for Big Oil","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Casey Mix and Grady Zant warn against Bruce Porter's ties to big oil.

The billions of dollars and corporate interests saturating campaigns every election cycle are overwhelming, leaving many American voters across the political spectrum feeling discouraged and powerless. One important way we as students can prevent the overwhelming influence of moneyed interests and so-called super PACs on election outcomes is by shifting our attention to local elections and propositions further down the ballot.</p>\n<p>Take the race for 3rd Third District Supervisor between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann in Santa Barbara County, for example. Porter’s campaign has been supported by over $60,000 from the oil and gas industries. These large donations from fossil fuel corporations in a relatively smaller local election should raise a red flag, especially given the county’s history with environmentally devastating oil spills. With four different energy companies looking to activate over a 1,000 new wells, currently awaiting approval in Santa Barbara County, a vote for Bruce Porter would almost certainly mean a vote for more oil drilling and fracking, environmental and social injustice, as well as supporting yet another politician who is for sale to the highest bidder.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, candidate Joan Hartmann has a long history of fighting the oil and gas industries. Hartmann’s biggest environmental victory was “helping found the Southern California Wetlands Recovery Project, a novel public-private partnership among government agencies, business and environmental interests that has secured over $628 million to restore rivers and wetlands from Gaviota to San Diego. These efforts increase water supplies, restore habitats, and create jobs,”<br>\n(joanhartmannforsupervisor.com).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This type of leadership, innovation and initiative in which protecting our environment can go hand-in-hand with protecting people and their jobs, is exactly what our community deserves from those who represent us. Moreover, this is the kind of leadership that, with public pressure, can protect our elections from the influence of big money and the fossil fuel industry. With an incredible array of endorsements from firefighters and nurses to the Sierra Club, it’s obvious which candidate will fight to protect our coasts, climate and futures (hint: it’s not Bruce).</p>\n<p>Because of its dense population, Isla Vista represents roughly one-third of the total votes for the Third District Supervisor election. This figure confirms how much of an impact young people potentially possess. It’s essential for students residing in Isla Vista to get to the polls on Nov. 8 to have their voices heard. Though one may feel discouraged regarding today’s political atmosphere, it’s imperative to understand that change starts at the bottom. Educating one’s self on down-ballot candidates is vital to real progress. Leaving local elections to a game of eeny-meeny-miny-mo is not only unacceptable, but leaves the door wide open to people who will corrupt our democracy and pollute our communities.</p>\n<p><em>Written by Casey Mix and Grady Zant </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/","id":5732,"author":{"id":389,"name":"Grady Zant"},"related":[5731,5730,5729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: End the Death Penalty and Its Problems: “Yes” on 62 and “No” on 66","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"UCSB literature professor Elisabeth Weber and Santa Barbara Deputy Public Defender encourages readers to vote \"yes\" on proposition 52, and \"no\" on proposition 66.

DNA exonerations have shown that our courts and their verdicts are not perfect. Defendants are wrongfully convicted even in the most serious cases. </p>\n<p>The death penalty forces families of victims through years of uncertainty and court hearings.</p>\n<p>The death penalty is enormously expensive. Since reinstating the death penalty in 1978, California has spent $5 billion prosecuting death penalty cases and maintaining an expensive death row that now houses 747 inmates. The prosecution of death penalty cases costs 18 times more than prosecution of life-sentence cases. Since 1978, only 13 death sentences have been carried out, at a staggering cost of $384 million per execution. </p>\n<p>The system has failed from a moral perspective as well. The death penalty does not deter crime. Legal proceedings keep the families of victims suffering in court for decades. </p>\n<p>Prop 62 will replace the failed death penalty with a life sentence without parole. Instead of sitting in expensive, private death row cells, convicted murderers will serve their life sentence in high-security prisons with the general population, while working and paying restitution. By ending the failed death penalty and all its problems, Prop 62 saves taxpayers $150 million a year. </p>\n<p>Prop 66 does not fix the problem. It creates new layers of bureaucracy and tinkers with appellate procedure in likely violation of the California Constitution. It shifts financial burdens onto counties and recklessly proposes to force inexperienced and unqualified defense attorneys to take the cases, increasing the risk that an innocent person would be sentenced to death. </p>\n<p>Opponents and supporters of the death penalty both agree it has failed in California. Please vote “yes” on Prop 62 and “no” on Prop 66. </p>\n<p><em>Elisabeth Weber is a literature professor at UCSB and Mark Saatjian is a Deputy Public Defender in Santa Barbara. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73832\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-04/letter-to-the-editor-end-the-death-penalty-and-its-problems-yes-on-62-and-no-on-66/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73832\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-04/letter-to-the-editor-end-the-death-penalty-and-its-problems-yes-on-62-and-no-on-66/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-04/letter-to-the-editor-end-the-death-penalty-and-its-problems-yes-on-62-and-no-on-66/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-04/letter-to-the-editor-end-the-death-penalty-and-its-problems-yes-on-62-and-no-on-66/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-04/letter-to-the-editor-end-the-death-penalty-and-its-problems-yes-on-62-and-no-on-66/","id":6208,"author":{"id":636,"name":"Elisabeth Weber"},"related":[6207,6206,6205],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: No on Measures I and J","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Propositions I and J opponent Lou Segal explains his reasons for voting no. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB students and residents in Isla Vista are being asked to vote for Santa Barbara School Bond Measure I, totaling $135 million, in this election. Although the money will be spent on some worthy projects, like replacing a few of the portables with permanent classrooms, a substantial amount of the funds ($40 million) are going to be spent on a brand new, very expensive football stadium (like the ones you see in football-crazy Texas), as well as locker rooms, gyms, swimming pool decks and astro turf, hardly the type of projects that will ensure better education outcomes for students. Not one penny will be spent to hire effective teachers/principals or to improve school instruction or curriculum.  </p>\n<p>The real problem for students renting in Isla Vista or in other areas of Santa Barbara is that this property tax will be added to a long list of school bond taxes for which property owners are already paying, including a $110 million school bond issue generously approved by voters only five years ago. Other school bonds, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, have been consumed by the school district, with no improvement in academic performance.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara/Goleta has become one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. Currently, the vacancy rate for rental properties in Isla Vista is less than one percent, with students undergoing relentless rent increases year in and year out. The average rents for apartments are two and half times the national average. In this type of rental market, landlords will have no trouble increasing rents to offset the additional property taxes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As you’re painfully aware, the cost of a college education has become unaffordable for many students and their parents.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For years, Santa Barbara students have been fighting for greater representation and say in Santa Barbara County. According to the most recent secretary of state report, Santa Barbara County has the second highest 18-25 age voting demographic in the State at 17.41 percent. Yet, continually, Isla Vista is largely left out of the process by the political establishment. </p>\n<p>As the secretary of the UCSB board of CALPIRG students, I have spent my time fighting on behalf of those who feel voiceless and powerless in our current system. Millions of Californians feel the same way UCSB students feel — that entrenched establishment voices matter more than theirs. Luckily, Californians will have the opportunity this November to change the system.</p>\n<p>Proposition 54 — the California Legislature Transparency Act — will put our voices first by requiring all bills being considered in the state legislature be posted online and be in print for 72 hours prior to a final vote in both houses. It will also require all committee hearings open to the public to be recorded and posted online within 24 hours and will allow attendees of public hearings to record and post their videos of the hearings. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Millions of Californians share our problem; there is no easy way to Sacramento without a significant investment of time and money. The current system ensures only those with money or close proximity can attend committee hearings and have their voices heard. The result is legislation that benefits a small few at the expense of the majority. </p>\n<p>Proposition 54 will bring democracy and transparency to all Californians with access to the internet. Committees will no longer be held in obscure Capitol rooms that escape media attention and public scrutiny, but instead in homes and dorm rooms across California. This new access to the legislative process will level the playing field between Californians and special interests, since lobbyists will no longer have an unchecked power to a legislator’s ear. </p>\n<p>With legislation posted online for 72 hours, Californians will have time to review legislation that matters to them.  After reading the legislation, Californians will be able to have educated conversations with their elected representatives and express their concerns or support. Legislators will benefit because they will hear directly from their constituents on how legislation affects their district and thus can vote accordingly. </p>\n<p>With the outdated rule banning video recordings of legislative sessions overturned, Californians will finally be able to follow the legislative process from start to finish. Californians will be able to see more than just a roll call of votes, but gain full access to a bill’s deliberations prior to a vote. Hundreds of cities and counties already allow it, so should our state Legislature</p>\n<p>Proposition 54 will deliver meaningful reform by making our legislative process more transparent while including millions of Californians from the legislative sidelines. If you feel our democracy should be more inclusive and that our government should be more transparent with its workings, then I encourage each of my fellow Gauchos to join me in voting “Yes” on Proposition 54 on Nov. 8. It’s time to end business as usual.</p>\n<p><em>Cole Hyatt is the current secretary of the UCSB board of CALPIRG students.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, I’ve had some up-close and personal experience with cheating. My parents’ marriage (and divorce) involved cheating, and lots of it. I was first made aware of my mom’s adultery when I was 12. Finding out this negative and damaging information without a doubt assisted in shaping my views on cheating. I had no sympathy or understanding toward anyone who cheated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I became older and began to enter into my own intimate relationships, I carried with me an intense fear of being betrayed. Sure enough, the first guy I ever went out with cheated within the first couple of weeks of us dating. I couldn’t possibly understand how someone could so easily disrespect and violate another person like this. The answer seemed so simple to me: if you don’t want to be committed to one person, then don’t be in a relationship. To me, there was no excuse for it. Ever. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years my experience with cheating has expanded and evolved. I’ve seen many others do it, go through it and I myself have even played a role in it. Up until recently I still had a pretty similar black-and-white perspective on it. Now, I think the issue might be a little more complex than I had originally thought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get me wrong; I still think cheating is horrible and potentially one of the most psychologically damaging things that can happen to a person. It can lower a person’s self-esteem beyond belief, forcing them to question their own self-worth and value. I’m still a huge proponent of not entering any sort of monogamous or committed relationship until one is sure they are willing to put forth the effort to make it work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am now more understanding when it comes to making a judgment on someone’s infidelity. I no longer feel the need to say “once and a cheater, always a cheater” after hearing about someone’s indiscretions. I don’t think it’s necessarily right to label every person who falters with a giant, red “C.” I’ve realized life is more complicated than that. Relationships are more complicated than that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was younger, I thought for sure love was the only thing you need to make a relationship work. I thought out of all of the factors required, love was by far the most important. Now, I actually think it’s one of the least. Loving people is easy. Falling in love is easy. Relationships, on the other hand, are hard. They require a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice. Above all else, relationships are a choice. You don’t really choose to love someone; you just kind of do it, sometimes even when you don’t want to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re in a relationship, you have to choose to respect that person. You have to choose to go home to them at night. You have to choose to forgo other options, options you might even think are better options. You have to choose them. Not everyone is in the position to make that choice. Some people just really can’t make that commitment, no matter how much they care about you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re one of these people who simply can’t commit, be honest about it. Accept that this is who you are, and don’t lead anyone to believe you’re different. Until you feel like you’re at a place in your life at which you are able to give someone the respect and loyalty they deserve, don’t try it. It only ends with dishonesty and disappointment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, people with commitment issues are not the only ones with the ability to cheat and betray. One of the most influencing factors in cheating is without a doubt alcohol. No matter who the person is, or however loyal they may be, alcohol changes things. It puts you in an altered state of mind in which your thoughts and decisions are no longer coherent or clear. I truly believe anyone can have a slip-up while under the influence of alcohol. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you’re one of these people who simply can’t commit, be honest about it. Accept that this is who you are, and don’t lead anyone to believe you’re different.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anyone can say they’ll do their best to control themselves while intoxicated, but is that really enough? Does that really prove they have a true commitment to you? In my opinion, no. The real effort comes in the form of them choosing to not get so belligerent they put themselves in a situation that might jeopardize the relationship. The real effort comes in the form of maturity, when they choose to limit themselves out of respect for you.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, relationships are all about making choices. If your partner is truly serious about choosing you, they’ll choose to not black out when they’re not with you. They’ll choose to walk away from the bartender who’s flirting with them.

This is even more remarkable because UC’s Clerical and Allied Services Unit earns 47 percent above the median Californian individual income ($46,583 vs. $31,587). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beneath those extraordinary numbers are some elementary research problems. Drier and Bomba used an abbreviated six-question survey to measure food security rather than the 18-question survey the USDA recommends. </span><a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/survey-tools.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the USDA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the six-question survey is “less precise and somewhat less reliable than 18-item measure” and “does not measure the most severe levels of food insecurity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report’s methodology is troubling in other ways. The authors acknowledge that their 2,890 respondents volunteered to take the survey online. That raises the possibility that those who responded were overwhelmingly (and unscientifically) attracted by questions about hunger. That’s called “self-selection,” and there’s no evidence the researchers accounted for a non-random sample.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Translation: the shorter survey and self-selection may have biased the results to overreport food insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Teamsters have used this sort of science to produce political findings before. A </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/family-budgets-wage-sufficiency-university-of-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previous study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> requested by Teamsters Local 2010 from the Economic Policy Institute estimated that 93 percent of UC clerical workers do not earn enough to cover a basic family budget. The study was built on the assumption of a one-parent, one-child household, though it’s not clear that’s representative of UC clerical worker households. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food insecurity is a real problem and the researchers correctly point out the negative effects it has on wellbeing. There is no doubt single-parent households face significant strain. But it is not clear why UC clerical workers suffer from food insecurity more than five times the average Californian while making above the individual median income. Studies that are methodologically flawed to overestimate the problem do a disservice to those who are actually going hungry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the study’s findings are correct, they raise a question the researchers did not ask: why can’t University of California support staff afford to eat? The answers may be related to other trends: the UC system has </span><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-uc-spending-20151011-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increased the number of high-paying administrative positions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by 60 percent over the past decade. At the same time, UC students have seen an increase in tuition of over </span><a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article60386766.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">200 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since 2000. These hikes make college less affordable for students who, in a separate study, </span><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-uc-food-insecurity-07112016-snap-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report high levels of food insecurity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least one UC official said the timing of Drier and Bomba’s report is suspicious, coming as it does during contract negotiations with Teamsters Local 2010. “I’m not surprised to see these kinds of things sort of planted, if you will, to affect the collective bargaining process,” said a </span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/california-today-u-c-workers-wages-hunger.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">university regent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent California Policy Center </span><a href=\"http://californiapolicycenter.org/income-inequality-at-uc-berkeley/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that UC Berkeley’s pay distribution is more unequal than Haiti’s, the world’s most unequal country.

Can I ask them to leave? I can’t just wake them up to have sex, can I? Would it be rude if we just did it with them in the room? I mean, really, are they going to wake up? They were up binge-watching “Stranger Things” ‘til 3 a.m. last night, so they have to be in a coma by now. The clock’s ticking and we need to make a choice, and from the hard-on I feel on my lower back I already know what his decision is. Just like that, we became a Beyoncé and Jay Z song; I was in a dress and he slid my panties to the side and we slowly had the hardest and quietest sex of my life up against my closet door, which was shielding us from the other bunk in case someone woke up. Thankfully my roommates didn’t wake up, but if they had I would have been beyond embarrassed and I probably would have never invited that guy back to my place. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the thrill of having someone(s) in the room was amazing, it wasn’t the right thing to do as a roommate, no matter how sexually frustrated I was. A system needs to be in place with your roommates about what to do when one of you needs to get done thoroughly. Sex is a great stress reliever and college is full of stress. I’ve heard everything from putting a sock or a tie on the door to sending out a group text saying “give me 20 minutes.” The fact is you’re sharing your living space with two other people who have the same needs as you. That’s three times the sexual frustration!</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Thankfully my roommates didn’t wake up, but if they had I would have been beyond embarrassed and I probably would have never invited that guy back to my place.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So if you don’t start off honest and place some boundaries </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it leads to having sex basically in your closet, then you’re going to have a rough first year, and not the good kind of rough, either. My suggestion is to have an open dialogue with your roommates. Sure, talking about sex is awkward and weird, but you know what’s weirder? Walking in on your roommate as she’s giving her boyfriend the best blowjob of his life and he cums in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mouth but is looking at </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because you just walked in on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">them</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (Yes, that really did happen to me, and the worse part is I maintained eye contact until she swallowed and then high-fived him! It was like I was a part of the job, and let’s face it, it’s not called a blowjob for nothing. Good work, team!) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t want to see that. Unless you’re into that stuff (to each their own). What you want in a triple is a place where you can be yourself and live your life without being invaded on or invading other people’s space in the room. So talk about your schedules and see when your roommates have classes so you and your partner don’t always have to do a 15-minute quickie and hope nobody comes home early. Get your roommates’ numbers just in case you do feel the urge while one of them has a gap between classes and may be in the residence hall, because let’s face it, when midterms and finals come, everyone will want to be cumming in some form or another.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Kelsey Pruett believes in your ability to work out your sex schedule, even if you live in a triple.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73480\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-26/triple-the-fun-a-guide-to-having-sex-in-a-triple/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73480\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-26/triple-the-fun-a-guide-to-having-sex-in-a-triple/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-26/triple-the-fun-a-guide-to-having-sex-in-a-triple/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-26/triple-the-fun-a-guide-to-having-sex-in-a-triple/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-26/triple-the-fun-a-guide-to-having-sex-in-a-triple/","id":6341,"author":{"id":637,"name":"Kelsey Pruett"},"related":[6340,6339,6338],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/opinion","page":12,"highestPage":59}},"__N_SSG":true}
